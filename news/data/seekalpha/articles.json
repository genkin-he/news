This profile helps explain its performance in the past, as its sensitivity to interest-rate changes is moderate relative to an ETF like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLT\" title=\"iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF\">TLT</a>), but meaningful to behave differently than short-duration vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When GOVT was launched, yields were close to record lows as a result of the central bank's quantitative easing that followed the GFC. That's the reason that since inception and up to around 2018, the performance is insignificant; yields rose slowly from very low levels, so income power remained weak while rising rates acted as a driver of modest downward pressure on the fund's price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to 2020, when the Fed lowered the Fed Funds rate to practically 0% in order to bring stability to the markets and the economy; GOVT rose sharply due to the steep decline in yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After inflation rose to high levels in the following years, the Fed intervened again by aggressively raising the policy rate of interest. This was also steep enough for GOVT's price to tank in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last, GOVT started recovering in late 2023 as it became clearer that inflation was falling towards the Fed's target and the central bank's rate hiking cycle was over.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2025, GOVT kept climbing higher in a consistent manner.

It remains sticky, as it started rising in late 2024 and resurfaced as a key issue during the summer. With CPI at 3%, meaningfully above the 2% target, the monetary policy path is tricky to forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared with short-duration vehicles, however, GOVT appears to be more attractive as well. Along with a higher risk of inflation, the labor market is also at risk of becoming a serious issue due to its softening in 2025 so far. That biases the Fed towards cutting further, even though the timing is highly uncertain. In such a scenario, GOVT should outperform both short and long duration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth is another tailwind for Treasuries. In the first half of 2025, GDP has grown by ~1.4% on an annualized basis as a result of a contraction in the first quarter and a recovery in the second. Tariffs must have played a role in that below-historical-average level of economic growth, on top of restrictive monetary policy over the last 3 years. Economic forecasters expect the trend to continue for some time. Although a recession is not the base case, the risk of one occurring is elevated, and along with soft growth, investors are likely to continue being defensive to a meaningful degree, favoring safe havens like Treasuries over equities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are, however, two main risks worth monitoring. The first is the scenario where inflation rises more dramatically in the near term than it has in the past 12 months. And second, fiscal policy implies that the budget deficit will remain wide; with the Fed not in QE mode, the issuance of intermediate-term Treasuries implies supply that the central bank will not be able to absorb, and this will apply upward pressure on yields.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not a time for a cash bias anymore, as rates are expected to come down faster now, and long duration offered by TLT offers a very early bet as the road will still be bumpy with inflation risk, as mentioned above. GOVT provides the sweet spot for fixed-income allocators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I am always open to challenging my views because being an ideologue in investing and trading can prove expensive.

On the other hand, the variable fees tied to advisory shares are set to rise alongside the stock’s performance.

Revenue was up 15% to $42.1 million, but the segment’s adjusted EBITDA fell to $9.1 million from $12.9 million a year earlier. Management maintained ongoing problems and litigation with Flexsys, the plant operator, which may be prolonged and is likely to be a drag on performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the IMS division continued to be a bright spot. It added four new product lines year-to-date and contributed $10.8 million of incremental revenue in Q3. The business is emerging as a scalable M&amp;A platform that can absorb small industrial product lines and enhance them through Perimeter’s value-driver framework.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a consolidated level, revenue <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_c8dc41d9f1252ac8cbd1dd81f51aaa0c/perimetersolutions/db/957/9435/presentation/Perimeter+Solutions+Inc+Q3+2025+Earnings+Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">rose</a> 9% to $315.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA improved 9% to $186.3 million. Free cash flow came in at $193.6 million for the quarter, driven by seasonal working capital release.

Of the $574.9 million total, $409.4 million was spent. Now, 2024 was a record fire year, and 2025 was a milder season, and the total outlay averages to $205 million. The new contract averages to $224 million, given the ceiling of $1.1 billion over five years. I think the revenue from this contract will likely be lower than the ceiling amount. And it seems to me that the value of the contract lies in exclusivity that locks in Perimeter as the sole supplier and adds strength to its monopoly moat. It also provides flexibility to the USFS to expand prevention operations and provides the company a stable source of revenue over the next five years. The visibility is nice, but I prefer a conservative approach to re-rating this as a case for multiple expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rising Founder Fees And Dilution Risk</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1449\" data-height=\"504\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Founder Advisory Fees\" width=\"640\" height=\"223\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Founder Advisory Fees <span>(Perimeter Solutions 2024 10-K)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the <a href=\"https://ir.perimeter-solutions.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001880319-25-000021/prm-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">disclosure</a> about the founder’s agreement, the fixed fee is 2.3 million shares per year, continuing through 2027.

In that scenario, the variable fee would climb to $239.8 million, or a 7.7% dilution on the current market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential 2026 variable fee = (25 – 16.52) x 18% x 157,137,410 = $239,854,543.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you consider the 4.65% dilution from the fixed fee (2025 – 2027), this nets to a 15% dilution without a potential variable fee in 2027 and a 0% return on the stock in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation &amp; Final Take</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sum of the parts valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"636\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sum of the parts valuation <span>(Tunga Capital)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation assumptions in my previous thesis turned out to be pretty conservative. The YTD adjusted EBITDA is already $295 million, whereas I had assumed about $312 million for the next twelve months. If you apply the YTD 20% growth rate to the final quarter, the run rate annualizes to $334 million. I have assumed about a 9% increase over that number for the next twelve months ($365 million). It’s based on the idea that even in a moderate fire year, the margin expansion from an all-powder footprint should offset the impact from the ongoing situation at the Sauget plant.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the absence of dilution, I’d likely still maintain a Strong Buy rating and wait for more data in future earnings. But the dilution effects really tamp down the upside. A re-rating now depends more on some of the other catalysts, such as solid-state batteries, coming into play. I am therefore maintaining a hold rating for now.</p>",

It's seeing my dividends come in\". What probably gives me even more pleasure is seeing my dividends come in from a variety of businesses around<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the world, operating in different countries, and paying me in different currencies. Good and solid dividend growth, in my view, is one of the better ways of building investment income that is protected from inflation, because even if the dollar weakens, these companies selling all over the world will convert their profits into whatever the market rate is to provide a growing level of purchasing power of all the things they are selling. For those who do not get as much pleasure from looking around the world for dividends, there are of course ETFs that make it easier than ever to buy a simple and cost effective package of these foreign dividend stocks, and collect their yields from a single ticker. The ETF I wanted to pick up and have a refreshed review of today is the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index ETF (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYMI\" title=\"Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares\">VYMI</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609020-vigi-vs-vymi-dividend-etf-better-buy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609020-vigi-vs-vymi-dividend-etf-better-buy\" target=\"_blank\">last reviewed VYMI in June 2023</a>, when I compared it against Vanguard's other international dividend ETF that focuses more on dividend growth than high yield, the Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIGI\" title=\"Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF Shares\">VIGI</a>). At that time, my conclusion was that I preferred VYMI over VIGI because of VYMI's significantly higher yield (=significantly deeper value tilt, and I believe in value), while still having enough of a screen on dividend growth. This quick chart shows how the total returns of the two funds have evolved since then.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_9c25e3818f4dd0b280a211ef967728ac.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier in 2023, I also wrote what is still <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582804-best-vanguard-funds-to-buy-2023\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582804-best-vanguard-funds-to-buy-2023\" target=\"_blank\">a very useful guide to what I believe are Vanguard's best ETFs to buy</a>, though I find it worth mentioning here that VYMI and VIGI were not in that guide. That is because, in my view, these dividend focused ETFs are not \"pure\" to the original Vanguard idea of simply buying the total market at the lowest possible cost, as opposed to paying up for a dividend screened portfolio. That said, Vanguard still is a leader at doing even these strategies very well and at very low cost, so I still consider them to be a leader in this category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this update, I will focus on highlighting VYMI's current portfolio holdings, its prospects for continued dividend growth, and its main competitors. In conclusion, I will then explain who I think this ETF is for, and which type of account I believe it is best held in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI's Current Portfolio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanguard ETFs publish their holdings only quarterly, so these observations are based on what I see on <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vymi/vanguard-international-high-dividend-yield-etf#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vymi/vanguard-international-high-dividend-yield-etf#overview\" target=\"_blank\">VYMI's homepage</a> dated September 30, 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographically, VYMI is quite diversified with about 14% in Japan, 11% in the UK, 8% in Canada, 7% in Switzerland, and 7% in Australia, among the top 5 developed markets. Mainland Chinese stocks make up a little over 6% of VYMI, though Taiwan and Hong Kong respectively make up about another 4% and 2%, which adds up to an overall exposure of 12% to \"Greater China\", which also sounds about right. There are also +1% allocations to other interesting markets like India, Mexico, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Korea, so while I might want to see more of a tilt towards these more minor markets, at least some exposure is there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of sector exposure, the one big standout is that over 42% of VYMI is in financials. This may not be surprising given that in many foreign markets, financials are the largest, and in some cases, only dividend paying stock available in that market, and effectively act like a leveraged exposure to that country's credit market. While I would love to see international dividend ETFs separate financials and non-financials so I can do my own mix, for now, this is what we have. The next four largest sector weightings in VYMI are energy, industrials, consumer discretionary and consumer staples at about 7-8% each, so starting to look quite well balanced once we get past the financials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, the single largest reported holding is British-based and Hong Kong focused bank HSBC Holdings Plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSBC\" title=\"HSBC Holdings plc\">HSBC</a>), which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133070-hsbc-still-more-of-a-hong-kong-than-a-global-or-u-k-bank\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133070-hsbc-still-more-of-a-hong-kong-than-a-global-or-u-k-bank\" target=\"_blank\">I first covered in 2017</a>, and still hold some shares in today in a few client accounts. The next three holdings are Switzerland's top 3 giants Novartis (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>), Roche (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBY\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\" target=\"_blank\">OTCQX:RHHBY</a>), and Nestle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY\" title=\"Nestlé S.A.\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:NSRGY</a>), so even the #3 and #4 holdings in this ETF trade OTC on the US market, which is one reason many US investors might prefer them packaged in an ETF. Rounding out the top 10 are names most readers will be very familiar with: Shell, Toyota, Mitsubishi, RBC, CBA, and Allianz.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI's Dividend: Past and Future</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI's reported dividend yield was 4.28% as of September 30, and would likely be about the same today as VYMI is up less than 1% over the month of October. That's only about 0.2% per year higher than the 10-year US Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" target=\"_blank\">US10Y</a>), so besides tax reasons (mentioned at the conclusion), the main reason to prefer VYMI over bonds is if you expect these dividends will not only not get cut, but will likely increase in the future. Below is the sum of dividends paid each calendar year since the fund's launch in 2016, showing an overall solid growth trend, even with plenty of fluctuation from year to year, much of which is due to currency fluctuations. Given the percentage of the portfolio invested in businesses that are likely to increase their dividends with inflation, I overall see this as a better long-term income portfolio than the 10-year treasury for many portfolios. </p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Year</td> <td>Sum of Dividend</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2016</td> <td>1.356</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2017</td> <td>2.1484</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2018</td> <td>2.4154</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2019</td> <td>2.6807</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2020</td> <td>1.9585</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2021</td> <td>2.8868</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2022</td> <td>2.8024</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2023</td> <td>3.0473</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2024</td> <td>3.2859</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2025 (Q1-Q3)</td> <td>2.3766</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI versus other International Dividend ETFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI is the largest non-US focused dividend ETF I am aware of at almost $13 billion in assets under management, over double that of the next largest with $6 billion, and the next three with about $2 billion each. Below is a quick YChart of these other four competing ETFs's relative assets under management, and rolling 5-year total returns, which I leave here with no further comment, as comparing these would deserve a whole different article. What I will mention here is that VYMI's expense ratio of only 0.17% is significantly lower than IDV's 0.49% and IHDG's 0.58%, but almost double the 0.09% charged by HDEF and DIVI. Of these two cheaper ETFs, HDEF focuses more on higher dividend yields, so its dividend yield is significantly higher than that of DIVI and closer to that of VYMI.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While VYMI is not the cheapest ETF focused on non-US high dividend stocks, it is the largest and overall has a solid portfolio, track record, and brand name. As with every ETF though, it's not for everyone, so I wanted to conclude by saying who it's for, where it's best to own it, and who it's not for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI could serve as a solid pillar in a portfolio primarily focused on generating dividend income, especially one that needs that dividend income to come from non-US sources to diversify away from US equity risk. In my view, it is ideally held in a US taxable account, as there it might be possible to claim foreign tax credits back from the foreign countries that withhold taxes on dividends paid out through this fund. I say <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4764677-beyond-vxus-3-reasons-to-use-single-country-etfs-instead\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4764677-beyond-vxus-3-reasons-to-use-single-country-etfs-instead\" target=\"_blank\">more about foreign tax credits in this article</a>, where I even say how to go even further with the idea for those who are really into maximizing foreign tax credits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So who is VYMI not for? First of all, I think this ETF may not be the best buy for many non-US investors, as the US may withhold taxes on VYMI distributions over and above those already withheld by the foreign companies when sending their dividends to this fund. Second, I'd rather hold VYMI in a taxable account, and hold US dividend stocks in an IRA or tax sheltered account, in order to maximize the tax credit benefit, as mentioned already. Finally, I would also say VYMI is not for investors who don't need the income and instead want to maximise total return, as opposed to just income return. There is a whole other argument about dividends and total return, but for now, I hope this review has been helpful for those just wanting to see how well VYMI does its job of letting you see your dividends come in from dozens of countries around the world.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

But there has been one exception in recent years. Since reading <em>Shoe Dog</em>, which is a memoir about<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Nike (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKE\" title=\"NIKE, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">NKE</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) co-founder Phil Knight, years ago, I have been interested in the footwear market. One company that plays in this space that I was previously bullish about is Wolverine</span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">World Wide (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WWW\" title=\"Wolverine World Wide, Inc.\">WWW</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">). And </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4543169-wolverine-world-wide-not-a-great-fit\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4543169-wolverine-world-wide-not-a-great-fit\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">since I originally downgraded it</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to a \"Hold\" in September 2022, the stock has indeed underperformed the market. But recently, financial performance has sent the share on a big leg, or I guess I should say foot, higher. In fact, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781758-wolverine-world-wide-sitting-on-sidelines-for-greater-clarity-from-this-turnaround\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781758-wolverine-world-wide-sitting-on-sidelines-for-greater-clarity-from-this-turnaround\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">since I last reaffirmed it</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as a \"Hold\" candidate back in May of this year, shares are up 73%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 21%. Clearly, the company is doing well. But in all honesty, this alone is not enough for me to change my overall assessment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you really take a step back and assess the company and look at how it's valued, you see a firm that is definitely not a value play. Yes, the firm's recent growth is encouraging. And it could pave the way for additional upside in the near term. But because of how the stock is priced on an absolute basis and relative to other similar firms, I maintain that a \"Hold\" rating is the most sensible approach. My assessment could change as new data comes in, and with management planning to announce financial results for the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year before the market opens on Nov. 5, and with analysts expecting some solid results, the firm could be set to do well. But at the end of the day, remaining principled is important when it comes to investing. So unless I see new data justify an upgrade, an upgrade isn't going to happen.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some stellar results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The newest data that we have regarding Wolverine World Wide covers through the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000125/www-20250628.htm#idd0336e64e60445ebba166f9e4253dd8_127\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000125/www-20250628.htm#idd0336e64e60445ebba166f9e4253dd8_127\" target=\"_blank\">second quarter of the 2025 fiscal year</a>. The branded footwear company, which sells its products in somewhere around 170 countries and territories, and which operates 121 retail stores in key markets and 39 direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites, reported revenue during that quarter of $474.2 million. This represented an increase of 11.5% over the $425.2 million generated a year earlier.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2218\" data-height=\"864\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"249\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"249\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616344614591477_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This rise in sales was driven largely by a surge in revenue associated with Active Group. Overall revenue skyrocketed 16.2%, or approximately $49.6 million. According to management, this was thanks to the $42.3 million benefit that the company got from Saucony and a $15.2 million benefit from Merrell. This growth has been driven by a concerted effort by management to really promote these brands. For instance, the Run As One campaign that the firm launched earlier this year after management initiated a <span>\"</span>strategic reset\" last year and the year before aimed at divesting of non-core assets and making other major corporate changes, really helped to position this as a growth engine for the company.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2078\" data-height=\"870\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"268\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"268\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634475166611_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The aforementioned campaign, which came out in early March of this year, focused on promoting things like global run club events, coffee shop residencies, and a multifaceted approach to advertising that included utilizing television, online, and a wide array of other forms of outreach to improve public awareness of the brand. As for Merrell, which is the firm's largest brand, its growth seems to have stemmed from a change in offerings to emphasize <span>\"</span>faster, lighter, more athletic\" product lines, with one example being the Moab Speed 2 that saw revenue almost quadruple year over year in the U<span>nited States</span>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall jump in revenue for the company was aided by the Work Group, which reported a 2.4% increase in revenue amounting to roughly $2.5 million. This was only because of strength from its Cat, Harley-Davidson, and HYTEST product lines, while its Bates and hallmark Wolverine brands reported declines in revenue. Meanwhile, its <span>\"</span>Other\" category reported a 21.7% drop in revenue amounting to $3.1 million. But this was because of a hit that the company took to its joint venture and royalty revenue streams and lower sales associated with Hush Puppies and Sperry.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2218\" data-height=\"870\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761634321269864_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As revenue increased, profitability for the institution shot up. Net income skyrocketed from $14.2 million to $26.8 million. Other profitability metrics performed well also. Operating cash flow jumped from $26.7 million to $44.6 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, the rise is even more impressive, from $2.6 million to $36.9 million. And finally, EBITDA for the business grew from $39.3 million to $47.7 million. In the chart above, you can also see financial results for the first half of 2025 compared to the same time last year.

In fact, management even mentioned that they are not at this time reinstating their 2025 annual outlook because of macroeconomic uncertainty. Although the company expects certain brands to do quite well, there are worries about the direction the economy is heading. And honestly, a good chunk of that worry seems to be associated with tariffs. When management announced results for the second quarter of 2025, they mentioned in their earnings call that the hit to the company should be around $20 million before any mitigation efforts. This is down from the $30 million initial impact that management had feared. In essence, what the company seems to be doing is working with suppliers to see if they can cover some of the cost increases. They are also reducing how much they are sourcing from China. In fact, earlier this year, somewhere in the mid-teens worth of their products came from that country. But now, that figure is less than 10%. Strategic price increases have also come into play. But given how weak consumer confidence is currently, I suspect that this could create some pressure on results moving forward.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1856\" data-height=\"874\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"301\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"301\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616343466030262_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we project out results based on what we have seen already for this year, we would get adjusted operating cash flow of $140.9 million and EBITDA of $188.8 million. Using these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently priced. These are multiples that put the company squarely in the fair value range, as I see it.

But that does not always equate to a good investment opportunity. Shares of the company are certainly not cheap. If anything, they are barely in the fair value category. And even though recent growth has been positive, I worry about management's decision to not provide any guidance. When you add on top of this weakening economic conditions, it seems clear to me that a \"Hold\" rating makes more sense than a \"Buy\" or a \"Sell\" at this time.</p>",

It may also help analyze funds tracking the index, such as <span class=\"cf0\">SPDR® Portfolio<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> S&amp;P 500® ETF</span></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPLG\" title=\"SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPLG</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">). SPLG is less popular than SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), but it is large and liquid enough for most investors and traders, with $95 billion in assets under management and an average daily volume of $728 million. Additionally, SPLG has a cheaper expense ratio (0.02% vs. 0.09% for SPY) and a lower share price, offering more flexibility for small investors.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Shortcut</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next two paragraphs in italic describe the dashboard methodology. They are necessary for new readers to understand the metrics. If you are used to this series or if you are short of time, you can skip them and go to the charts.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Base Metrics</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I calculate the median value of five fundamental ratios in every sector: Earnings Yield (\"EY\"), Sales Yield (\"SY\"), Free Cash Flow Yield (\"FY\"), Return on Equity (\"ROE\"), Gross Margin (\"GM\"). All are calculated on trailing 12 months. For all these ratios, higher is better and negative is bad. EY, SY and FY are medians of the inverse of Price/Earnings, Price/Sales and Price/Free Cash Flow. They are better for statistical studies than price-to-something ratios, which are unusable when the \"something\" is close to zero or negative (for example, companies with negative earnings). I also calculate two momentum metrics for each group: the median monthly return (RetM) and the median annual return (RetY).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I prefer medians rather than averages because a median splits a set in a good half and a bad half. Capital-weighted averages are skewed by extreme values and the largest companies. As a consequence, these metrics are designed for stock-picking rather than index investing.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Value and Quality Scores</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Historical baselines are calculated as the averages on a look-back period of 11 years for all metrics. They are noted respectively EYh, SYh, FYh, ROEh, GMh. For example, the value of EYh for technology in the table below is the 11-year average of the median Earnings Yield of S&amp;P 500 tech companies.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The Value Score \"VS\" is the average difference in % between the three valuation ratios ((EY, SY, FY)) and their baselines (EYh, SYh, FYh). The same way, the Quality Score \"QS\" is the average difference between the two quality ratios ((ROE, GM)) and their baselines (ROEh, GMh). </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>VS may be interpreted as the percentage of undervaluation or overvaluation relative to the baseline (positive is good, negative is bad). This interpretation must be taken with caution: the baseline is an arbitrary reference, not a supposed fair value. The formula assumes that the three valuation metrics are of equal importance, except in energy and utilities where the Free Cash Flow Yield is ignored to avoid some inconsistencies. VS and QS</em><em> are capped between -100 and +100</em><em> when the calculation goes </em><em>beyond </em><em>th</em><em>ese</em><em> value</em><em>s</em><em>.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Current data</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next table shows the metrics and scores as of writing. Columns stand for all the data defined above.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td></td> <td><p>VS</p></td> <td><p>QS</p></td> <td><p>EY</p></td> <td><p>SY</p></td> <td><p>FY</p></td> <td><p>ROE</p></td> <td><p>GM</p></td> <td><p>EYh</p></td> <td><p>SYh</p></td> <td><p>FYh</p></td> <td><p>ROEh</p></td> <td><p>GMh</p></td> <td><p>RetM</p></td> <td><p>RetY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>All</p></td> <td><p>-13.04</p></td> <td><p>3.35</p></td> <td><p>0.0381</p></td> <td><p>0.3225</p></td> <td><p>0.0226</p></td> <td><p>15.60</p></td> <td><p>49.54</p></td> <td><p>0.0414</p></td> <td><p>0.3890</p></td> <td><p>0.0263</p></td> <td><p>15.40</p></td> <td><p>47.01</p></td> <td><p>-1.49%</p></td> <td><p>3.26%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cs.

class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interpretation</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A hypothetical S&amp;P 500 median company is overvalued by 13% relative to historical averages since 2014. Its quality score is close to the historical baseline. We can translate median yields into their inverse ratios:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Price/Earnings: 26.25</li> <li>Price/Sales: 3.10</li> <li>Price/Free Cash Flow: 44.25.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy still has the highest value and quality scores among GICS sectors (it has been so since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4483198-ivv-sp-500-dashboard-for-february\">February 2022</a>). Healthcare, consumer staples, and real estate are very close to their 11-year averages in valuation. Financials, communication and consumer discretionary are moderately overvalued. Utilities, materials, industrials and technology are significantly overvalued (by 18% to 26% based on my metrics).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPLG has returned 21.1% in 12 months, while the median return of the S&amp;P 500 is only 3.3% (reported in the table above) and the equal-weight average is 8.2% (measured on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight ETF\">RSP</a>). It means individual stocks across the board have not done so well as the S&amp;P 500’s return suggest. The index has been significantly skewed by mega-cap companies over the last 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table above is not only useful to calculate value and quality scores. It may also help spot companies with attractive value relative to their peers. For example, the EY column tells that a large consumer staples company with an Earnings Yield above 0.0450 (or price/earnings below 22.22) is in the better half of the sector regarding this metric. A Dashboard List is sent every month to Quantitative Risk &amp; Value members with companies standing in the better half among their peers regarding the three valuation metrics. The companies listed below are part of the list sent to QRV members for this month.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Ticker</p></td> <td><p>Company</p></td> <td><p>Sector</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCL\" title=\"Carnival Corporation &amp; plc\">CCL</a></p></td> <td><p>Carnival Corp.</p></td> <td><p>DISCRETIONARY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APA\" title=\"APA Corporation\">APA</a></p></td> <td><p>APA Corp.</p></td> <td><p>ENERGY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYF\" title=\"Synchrony Financial\">SYF</a></p></td> <td><p>Synchrony Financial</p></td> <td><p>FINANCIAL</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/THC\" title=\"Tenet Healthcare Corporation\">THC</a></p></td> <td><p>Tenet Healthcare Corp.</p></td> <td><p>HEALTHCARE</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UAL\" title=\"United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\">UAL</a></p></td> <td><p>United Airlines Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>INDUSTRIAL</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAG\" title=\"Conagra Brands, Inc.\">CAG</a></p></td> <td><p>Conagra Brands, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>STAPLES</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a></p></td> <td><p>QUALCOMM, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>TECH</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCG\" title=\"PG&amp;E Corporation\">PCG</a></p></td> <td><p>PG&amp;E Corp.</p></td> <td><p>UTIL</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is part of a larger rotational model with a positive bias on the long-term, not the result of in-depth stock analysis.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Management<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> is planning on bringing back some of its cold-stacked rigs to capture the positive price momentum that day rates are seeing right now.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the market behaves like the last market cycle Valaris is well positioned to grow its adj. EBITDA by a substantial amount in the next few years. As an extra on the side its partnership with Saudi Aramco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARMCO\" title=\"Saudi Aramco\">ARMCO</a>) through ARO Drilling could provide a significant EBITDA boost as the venture seeks to grow the current rig count of 16 to 30 before 2035. Valaris shows clear upside potential, given the amount, making shares a Strong Buy now. The recent Q3 report only supports the thesis of growing day rates and stronger operational performance.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5-Year Performance Comparison</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To preface the rest of the article, I’ve compared the 5-year price performance of Valaris to three ETFs.

It owns VAL as well, which makes up 4.52%, making it the 9th largest holding.</p></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VanEck Oil &amp; Services ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OIH\" title=\"VanEck Oil Services ETF\">OIH</a>)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><p>A more niche ETF with more exposure to oil service companies specifically. Largest holding is SLB Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLB\" title=\"SLB Limited\">SLB</a>) at 18.6%. Like XIS it owns VAL as well as its 10th largest holding, accounting for 4.02%.</p></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a>)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><p>The “gold standard” for comparing, at least for me. If you can’t beat it then join. Now largely tech heavy but good to value against as being in a potentially terminally underperforming sector like energy would be a drag on future portfolio growth.</p></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the comparison it’s clear that it would have been much better to start an investment in a broader sector ETF rather than specifically Valaris. It followed the others very closely but then fell off. I want to highlight that Valaris never outperformed these ETFs, except for the SPY at any point. So investors got the higher associated risk of holding a specific stock and less alpha during the past 5 years. Valaris also doesn't have a dividend, something both XIS and OIH has, providing between 1.7 - 1.9% annually. This isn’t an article to just compare VAL to broad sector ETFs, but I think it's worth raising the point — “would it be worthwhile investing in Valaris, when these lower risk, higher yielding equities have performed better?”. To that I would say, yes. The upside is there and I think the years of underperforming has meant the valuation is also more attractive at the moment.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Forward Growth Assumptions And Management Comments</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1152\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Growth assumptions\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267817358668_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Growth Assumptions <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What about the forward assumptions for the company?

NE, on of Valaris' peers for instance contracted one of its rigs in the Gulf for <a href=\"https://investorplace.com/2012/07/surging-drill-rig-rates-will-fuel-noble/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$618,000 per day</a>. This is far above today's levels. Valaris is a little different since it wasn't the same as today back then. In 2019 it was created after the <a href=\"https://www.valaris.com/news/news-details/2019/Ensco-plc-and-Rowan-Companies-plc-Merge-to-Form-Ensco-Rowan-plc-Industry-Leading-Offshore-Driller/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">merger</a> between Ensco and Rowan. Between 2012 and 2011 Ensco <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/956522167/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2012/q4/2012-Q4-10-K.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> 53% higher revenues, 49% adj. EBITDA margin ($1.56 billion operating income + $558 million depreciation). Many of the contracts Ensco secured at this time saw day rates in the range of $450,000 - $530,000. The <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/956522167/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2013/q4/2013-Q4-SEC-10-K.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">year after</a> (Q3 2013) Ensco secured a long-term contract with a day rate of $648,000 for its ENSCO DS-7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arguable what set the rise in motion was the explosion of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijnI7LtsyQAxU21QIHHeg7NmoQFnoECB0QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wVwjb-zQXj5axgeh9_Evo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Deepwater Horizon</a> that occurred off the coast of the US in 2010. It set back drilling in the region and offshore drilling investments came to a halt, creating a shortage in the number of active drills. The structure is similar this time too with tighter market conditions where less rigs are available and demand is increasing. Of course the price later came down heavily from the peak the last market cycle, with the years between 2014 and up until now mostly hovering in the range of $200,000 - 300,000. That doesn't mean we can't capitalize as investors on this cycle, that is much of what this whole thesis is based on. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When asked about spot prices and the implication that utilization rates will have on them CEO Anton Dibowitz <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/valaris-at-barclays-conference-offshore-drillings-bright-future-93CH-4220005\" rel=\"nofollow\">said this</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“based on the timing of startups of programs, we expect to be exiting 2026 with utilization of 90% or better.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This again speaks to the fact that management sees a potential cycle peak occurring in the next few years. Is that the best time to be buying the stock? Most certainly not. Is there still upside to VAL if rates climb from here, potentially reaching $800,000 or beyond that? I think there could be a lot of upside yet to be fully priced into the stock, therefore my bullish conclusion. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Day Rate Growth Analysis And Implications On Future Revenues</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently spot rates are around or a little over the $400,000 mark as seen in the Q3 report, for drillships that is. Semisubmersibles and jackups are far below that. Crucially, VAL has several cold-stacked rigs, bringing the total fleet utilization rate down to 48%. The current active fleet has an active rate of 63%, again for drillships. At the moment there are 3 cold-stacked drillships. When <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/valaris-at-barclays-conference-offshore-drillings-bright-future-93CH-4220005\" rel=\"noopener\">asked</a> when the company might increase the number of active drillships, VAL's CEO responded with that these may be up and running in 2028</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“I think ’28 is a reasonable assumption if I can be so bold.

I’ve used the same peak as the last cycle of $800,000. Utilization rates tend to be at 99% during these peaks and revenue efficiency is high as well. I expect the day rates to fall in the following year quite drastically, similar to what the last cycle showed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"378\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Segment forecast\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618268746367981_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Segment Forecast <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jackups typically see about 30 - 40% of the spot price of what drillships have, so the peak here is around $280,000 instead during 2028 as I modeled using the middle range (35%).

The CEO of ARO Drilling Mohamed Hegazi mentioned the company's plan in a <a href=\"https://theenergyyear.com/articles/saudi-arabias-offshore-drilling-expansion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023 interview</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“Our strategic plan involves adding 20 rigs to our fleet over the next decade.

This is my baseline for all of the four years as I won’t make assumptions on when ARO adds more, as no clear roadmap has been published as far as I know.

EBITDA margin as it will act as a sort of base case seeing as its the TTM figure VAL has reported. I say it's the base case since I anticipate day rates to rise which would likely lead to adj. EBITDA margin growing as well. Operating expenses will stay the same but the increase in day rates acts as a flat revenue boost, which is why I think it's reasonable to expect the margins to rise from today's levels. But for the sake of staying reasonable, I'm using 27%, which still shows a large earnings potential for VAL over the next 4 years. </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Tailwinds Supporting Higher Day Rates</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The three main tailwinds that supports day rates actually continuing upwards from here and reaching the same or a similar price peak as in 2014 is this:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a structural <a href=\"https://www.westwoodenergy.com/news/westwood-insight-impending-shortage-of-jackups-within-ageing-asia-pacific-fleet\" rel=\"nofollow\">undersupply</a> of offshore rigs. Following the last market cycle, a lot of these rigs got cold-stacked and even more so during the pandemic. <a href=\"https://mexicobusiness.news/oilandgas/news/global-offshore-rig-market-rebound-mexican-activity-lags\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">Several</a> peers expect a rebound for offshore rigs in 2026. RIG CEO Keelan Adamson <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slump-surge-transocean-predicts-offshore-145400426.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIlLO9LUtJXeAbg3AQsJNum6NPyoWN63YM5gmr5_GPDJmjawSLK0SLGHbLr8sm2up-6LADwcZS8toem_hkWZiU43_BRD9YtKHJhDunQWP_CSrP-OW8bXoYhrQpbcku1cFcCAuuksD0H6c6_xZBjXcDZo9vDpjUu5aM-J7vfpJ1MH\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“We’re going to see more of the active fleet being contracted and as we move out into the end of this year and into 2026, we’re going to see a lot more contracting activity and tendering activity for the out years of ‘26 and beyond.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Noble Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NE\" title=\"Noble Corporation plc\">NE</a>), another close peers <a href=\"https://oilnow.gy/featured/noble-expands-backlog-to-us7-billion-amid-lower-quarterly-earnings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> the same thing under their last earnings report not that many days ago. </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“While we anticipate a moderately lower earnings and cash flow profile in H1(first half) 2026 compared to H2 2025, the foundation for an improving market and corresponding earnings inflection is well underway.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So VAL is not alone in saying the market is primed for a rebound next year. The CEO of VAL went on in the <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/valaris-at-barclays-conference-offshore-drillings-bright-future-93CH-4220005\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barclays interview</a> to cite the tightening of supply as a key driver of price hikes. The cost of re-instating cold-stacked rigs is also quite high. Some reports from 2023 mentioned $80 - 90 million. The cost of then building drillships wasn’t feasible either and since we’ve had a more hawkish Fed, access to cheap capital has led to less rigs being built.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"390\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Drillship cost\" width=\"640\" height=\"147\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/63186098-17618267900122325_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Drillship Cost Breakdown <span>(Westwood Global Energy)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With shale gains <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-shale-plateau-if-oil-prices-stay-current-range-conocophillips-ceo-says-2025-05-20/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">on the path to plateau soon</a>, a lot of companies are pivoting offshore instead. The Permian Basin for example has seen parts of it reach <a href=\"https://pgjonline.com/news/2025/april/permian-oil-growth-slows-as-us-shale-hits-geological-limits\" rel=\"nofollow\">geological limits</a>. Other areas are yet to be drilled but are <a href=\"https://energynow.ca/2025/08/sliding-us-rig-count-outpaces-efficiency-gains-threatening-onshore-oil-output/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">predicted</a> to yield lower. The best parts of the Permian is often said to be \"Wolfcamp, Spraberry or Bone Spring\". They have the best combination of thickness, TOC and rock quality. They're often referred to as Tier-1 wells. Newer areas like Yeso or Atoka have lower TOC and generally more variability, basically meaning some wells might be done whilst others are not. This leads to lower output or lower yield, compared to the more well established and utilized areas of the Permian. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This indicates the large oil producing region might have peaked. This supports the thesis that energy companies will pivot to offshore which still has a way to go before peaking. This is visible as backlogs have risen sharply in recent quarters. VAL now has a $4.45 billion contracted backlog, up from $3.1 billion in <a href=\"https://www.valaris.com/news/news-details/2023/Valaris-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 2023</a> and $2.2 billion in Q3 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third tailwind is that global oil suppliers are being conservative with production, keeping the price between $80 - 90 per barrel. Companies are focusing on returning capital to shareholders and the best way to realize this is by having stable and relatively high oil prices.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Valuation Put Into Perspective</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve calculated how VAL could hit $1.359 billion in adj. EBITDA in 2028 if the market cycle plays out like the last time. The last time, that being in 2013 and early 2014 the day rates surged rapidly, utilization rates peaked at 99% and many off shore companies posted record top and bottom line results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current EV of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VAL/valuation/capital-structure\">$4.69 billion</a> it makes shares look substantially undervalued. EV/EBITDA for the sector is typically in the 6-7x range. My 2028 estimate would put Valaris at an EV of $8.833 billion. If we combine and normalize the EBITDA over the next 4 years, as per my earlier models, the EV would be $6.212 billion instead (using $955 million normalized EBITDA). This seems more realistic. Based on today's EV this leaves an upside potential in the range of 30-35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If ARO Drilling manages to build out its fleet to over 20 by 2029 it could see the valuation going higher as it would mean a moderate increase in the EBITDA Valaris receives.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The success of this investment heavily relies on oil companies continuing to spend on offshore ventures and rigs, building demand and premium for companies like Valaris. Offshore projects typically have a tough time getting funding if the price of oil is seen as shaky or risking decline over the next decade. We saw during the past few years how OPEC+ was struggling keeping the price stable as Russia, one of the largest oil producers in the world, increased production levels to help finance its country. There is a risk of countries going “rogue” and not adhering to OPEC+ which would put downwards pressure on oil prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To capture new contracts Valaris needs to reactive cold-stacked rigs, not just drillships but jackups as well. This will be capital intensive and could constrain the company's balance sheet. Reactivating these cold-stacked rigs are also part of my revenue estimates, so if the company decides against this it would be reflected negatively in the future revenue assumptions I’ve made.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Full Picture</h3> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Offshore is going to have its time in the spotlight soon and VAL is a great play on this. Its strong core operations with several 7th generation rigs make it a premium option, leading to higher day rates and realized revenues. The shift towards offshore is coming as there is a structural undersupply of rigs after years of cold-stacking. Coupled with high costs of reactivating it’s creating a perfect storm for prices to surge. I expect VAL will be able to very well capture this momentum. My model also puts shares at a very considerable undervaluation if prices peak in 2028. Rating shares a Strong Buy as I initiate coverage on this stock</p>",

The vaccine compared favorably to a 56% survival rate when using Keytruda from <strong>Merck</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK\" title=\"Merck &amp; Co., Inc.\">MRK</a>) alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The actual shocking news from last week was a study suggesting mRNA-based Covid vaccines from <strong>Pfizer</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) and Modena were effective in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506131-mrna-covid-shots-may-bolster-cancer-drug-effects\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506131-mrna-covid-shots-may-bolster-cancer-drug-effects\" target=\"_blank\">boosting the survival rates</a> of patients with lung cancer. The study results were shocking due to the patients taking the vaccines for protection against Covid, not cancer related.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analaysts from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson researched 1,000 patients who received treatments for advanced skin and lung cancer treatments at MD Anderson between 2019 and 2023. The key is that patients received the mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors while further research might show even stronger benefits to patients receiving the mRNA vaccine within a 30-day window before or after treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results were a surprise bonus considering the current negativity towards vaccines from Health &amp; Human Services. According to the research, patients with advanced lung cancer saw median survival rates nearly double, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3. The survival rates for metastatic melanoma were boosted from 26.7 months to 30–40 months with some patients still alive at the time of data collection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Noteworthy, non-mRNA shots for pneumonia and the flu didn't provide any survival benefits. Also, patients with severe lung cancer are likely to be older and survival rates extending beyond three years might naturally run into other causes of death.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The timing of Moderna talking to a large biopharma on a partnership or buyout is interesting considering this impressive cancer data. The researches plan to validate the data in a clinical trial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The personalized cancer vaccine market was targeted to reach <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/personalized-cancer-vaccine-market-size-to-exceed-usd-8-501-14-million-by-2034#:~:text=The%20global%20personalized%20cancer%20vaccine,published%20by%20Vision%20Research%20Reports.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/personalized-cancer-vaccine-market-size-to-exceed-usd-8-501-14-million-by-2034#:~:text=The%20global%20personalized%20cancer%20vaccine,published%20by%20Vision%20Research%20Reports.\" target=\"_blank\">$8.5 billion</a> by 2034, but the data from the Covid vaccine research suggest personalized cancer vaccines might not be needed.

With Moderna potentially having an already approved relatively inexpensive vaccine that works on cancer, a larger biopharma could definitely have interest in a partnership or buyout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock trades at multi-year lows and has hit strong support at $25. The CEO bought <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4417222-moderna-ceo-bancel-buys-5m-worth-company-stock-open-market\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4417222-moderna-ceo-bancel-buys-5m-worth-company-stock-open-market\" target=\"_blank\">$5 million worth of stock</a> back in March at higher prices of around $31, so investors can actually acquire shares below the CEO purchase price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Naturally, the risk is that this promising cancer vaccine data turns out to not prove related to the mRNA vaccines. The large biotech faces a massive cash crunch without a viable new drug to stem the sales dip from faltering Covid vaccine sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock only has a market cap of $11 billion with the large cash balance, but sales are forecast to slip below $2 billion this year.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that Moderna is a bargain, if the cancer vaccines turned into key products. The surprise data from the Covid vaccine clearly increases the odds of a successful drug.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors shouldn't bet on a buyout or partnership, especially with the cancer vaccine data pointing to a potential hit drug in the future.
