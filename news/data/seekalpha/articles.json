Ultimately, I conclude that the choice is Constellium SE (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSTM\" title=\"Constellium SE\">CSTM</a></span>) for three main<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> reasons: first, it strongly benefits from numerous secular tailwinds (so many nascent industries will depend on aluminum and aluminum alloys); second, the company is shifting toward a higher-margin mix of products; and third, the stock currently trades with an extremely attractive valuation. I argue that the market views this stock as a cyclical processor of aluminum, when in fact it is growing into a major supplier of high-margin parts for automotive and aerospace customers.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Methodology</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Creating the Shortlist</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to start by imagining what the best stock to buy right now would look like. First, we're in a time in which the impacts of AI are uncertain. There are two competing themes: that we're at the start of a transformational AI revolution or that we're nearing the peak of an AI bubble in which revenues at companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI are actually illusory. The best stock for 2026 has to be a winner in both outcomes. I don't want my pick to lean too heavily on getting the AI macro thesis correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, I want a company that has a large barrier to entry - in other words, a wide moat. A moat is difficult to quantify, but generally strong profitability metrics (high margins relative to the industry and sector) are indicative of a company with a sustainable competitive advantage. If the company is in a monopolistic or oligarchic market, then that would be ideal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, I want a company that has a simple, easy-to-understand business model. I want a pick where every reader can easily understand how the company makes money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want a company that is at least fairly valued. I use both Seeking Alpha's valuation grade and the PEG ratio (which is one of my preferred valuation metrics) to help narrow down the list, looking for stocks with the following characteristics:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Quant Rating = Strong Buy</li> <li>Valuation Grade = C or better</li> <li>PEG Ratio &lt; 1.2</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This screening produced 48 names, which I narrowed down to the following shortlist: MU, AMD, BNS, BCS, DELL, GM, CLS, and BRK.B, CSTM. I added some other \"Strong Buy\" stocks into consideration myself: AVGO, LITE, NESR, NEM, and IBRK.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trimming the Field</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of these names are too integrated into the danger of an AI CapEx Bubble for my liking: MU, AMD, AVGO, DELL, LITE, and CLS. So I discarded those first. I also don't want potential low-margin value traps and/or financial institutions, so that eliminates BCS, BNS, and GM from the list. NESR I eliminated from consideration because I believe it's too tied up with Middle Eastern geopolitical risk. Finally, I didn't want companies whose futures are tied directly to gold, as I believe it's become a bit of a speculative market (for example, kids in China buying up \"gold beads\"). So that eliminated NEM from consideration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That leaves three finalists: IBKR, BRK.B and CSTM. Let's go through each one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had originally intended to write this article on IBRK. I thought it was a perfect stock to pitch to the Seeking Alpha audience for obvious reasons. But when I got to valuing the company, I used a residual income approach, and I just couldn't justify the current valuation even with optimistic assumptions. Even though I think it's a great business (and my favorite online broker), valuation is non-negotiable, so I cannot recommend the stock as the best pick of 2026 if the valuation leaves little upside potential. It is a stock I will buy if I can get it at a cheaper price, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Berkshire Hathaway is a company I think is legitimately undervalued right now. Berkshire has about $358 billion cash on hand and a $290 billion public equity portfolio. So with a market cap of $1.09 trillion, the remaining part of the business, which is a cash-generating machine, is valued at $442 billion at the time of writing. That's about a 9.8x multiple on the segment's operating earnings. So in my view, BRK.B (or BRK.A) is a great buy for 2026, given that it's insulated from either AI disruption or an AI bubble and tends to do well in choppy markets and during corrections. However, if there is anything that doesn't scream \"hidden gem\" it's Berkshire Hathaway. Anyone can tell you to buy Berkshire, but it's not an idea that's worthy of a \"2026 top pick.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So by process of elimination, we land on the real top pick of 2026 in my view: Constellium SE. This stock immediately caught my eye. First, it has one of the highest Quant ratings on Seeking Alpha at 4.95 (ranked 31 out of 4281), and the metrics for this stock are flashing green across the board:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310902791905.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CSTM Quant Scorecard\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"377\" height=\"581\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310902791905.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310902791905.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation looks extremely attractive on almost all metrics:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"739\" data-height=\"978\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CSTM Valuation Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"847\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also has strong profitability metrics. Return on equity is 32.93%, compared to a sector median of 5.44%. It is, however, a relatively low-margin business (more on that later). The company is projected to grow EPS at nearly 70% CAGR over the next 3-5 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its face, this stock almost looks too good to be true, which has me asking, \"What's the catch?\" Although ratings and numbers can flag potentially good ideas, the devil is in the details of the company's fundamentals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Model: How Does CSTM Make Money?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quoting the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/171336525\">most recent 10K</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We are a global leader in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of high value-added specialty rolled and extruded aluminum products to the aerospace, space, defense, packaging, automotive, commercial transportation and general industrial end-markets. Our business model is to add value by converting aluminum into semi-fabricated and in some instances fully-fabricated alloyed aluminum products which meet stringent and performance-critical requirements from our customers. Our product portfolio generally commands higher margins as compared to less differentiated, more commoditized aluminum products. Our business model aims to pass through aluminum price exposure by pricing our products to include the cost of the metal purchased and hedging any remaining exposure to achieve aluminum price neutrality.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important thing to note is that this stock is not a speculative play on the price of aluminum. In fact, the company hedges its exposure to aluminum prices, which means that the success of the business is tied to the amount of refined aluminum products that are demanded rather than how aluminum is trading in spot markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has three operating segments: Aerospace &amp; Transportation (A&amp;T), Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products (P&amp;ARP), and Automotive Structures &amp; Industry (AS&amp;I). The A&amp;T segment provides technical products to companies in the aerospace, space, and industrial sectors (companies like Airbus, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and others). P&amp;ARP is the biggest segment by revenue, but it's also the lowest margin. It essentially provides rolled aluminum for products like beverage cans and auto body sheets. AS&amp;I provides technical products for automobiles like crash management systems and body structures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM is essentially a middleman between raw aluminum (both primary and recycled) and producers of goods that require aluminum. The following graphics from the company's 10-K show Constellium's position in the aluminum supply chain:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"718\" data-height=\"472\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Constellium Supply Chain Graphic\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CSTM 10K</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is CSTM a Good Buy Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are a number of tailwinds I see for this company. I'll go through them one by one:</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Recyclability of Aluminum</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since aluminum is infinitely recyclable, the more that is mined and refined, the larger the recyclable pool is. Since recyclable aluminum is cheaper than primary aluminum, CSTM's input prices are likely to decrease over time as it uses more and more recycled aluminum as its primary input. CSTM actually recycles aluminum themselves. One location at Muscle Shoals called \"Element 13\" is <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constelliums-muscle-shoals-plant-receives-alabamas-large-manufacturer-of-the-year-award\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of the largest recycling facilities on the planet</a>, with the capacity to recycle 20 billion used cans per year. The company has the capacity to recycle 750,000 metric tons of aluminum per year. Recycling aluminum is a massive cost saver vs smelting primary aluminum from raw bauxite - it's about 95% less energy intensive, and the raw material cost is lower. Constellium has contracts with its customers to purchase recyclable scrap, so the company's sold products can become their own raw materials. Going back to the above graphic, with suppliers on the left and customers on the right, we could almost turn this into a loop. In some cases Constellium's customers are its suppliers - it buys aluminum scrap from its customers and recycles it into new raw materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM still depends on primary aluminum for 60% of its raw material supply. But the company has been expanding recycling operations, which has the potential to expand profit margins by lowering raw material costs.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Automotive Transition to EVs/Greater Fuel Efficiency</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High-quality aluminum products are key to the EV transition. Because EV batteries are so heavy, \"lightweighting\" the rest of the vehicle is key to attractive range. Aluminum tends to be the best product for that, given its high strength-to-weight ratio. Of course, makers of traditional automobiles also want to achieve the greatest efficiency they can, which necessitates greater reliance on aluminum as well. CSTM is one of the largest providers of aluminum products to major car manufacturers in North America and Europe. CSTM stands ready to benefit from the major push toward efficiency in both EV and ICE vehicles.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Constellium is a Key Supplier in the New Space Race</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blue Origin's <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-to-supply-airware-r-aluminium-solutions-to-blue-origin\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Glenn</a>, SpaceX's <a href=\"https://www.lightmetalage.com/news/industry-news/aerospace/how-light-metals-help-spacex-land-falcon-9-rockets-with-astonishing-accuracy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falcon 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-brings-nasas-artemis-mission-home-to-ravenswood-wv\" rel=\"noopener\">Space Launch System,</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-to-present-new-aerospace-innovations-at-paris-air-show#:~:text=No%20fewer%20than%20seven%20different,%C2%AE%20portfolio%20with%20new%20additions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orion Spacecraft</a> are all users of CSTM's aluminum alloy called \"Airware,\" which is a line of proprietary aluminum-lithium alloys. This kind of alloy is frequently used in rockets, especially reusable rockets like Falcon 9, because of its high strength-to-weight ratio. While Starship is unique in using fully stainless-steel alloys, nearly every other launch vehicle (like Blue Origin's New Glenn) uses aluminum-lithium alloys. If you believe that space is about to become commercialized, then CSTM could be an indirect way to invest in that future. The fact that CSTM, a European-headquartered company, actively won contracts with SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA away from American legacy aluminum-lithium suppliers is strong evidence of the quality of the company's product for spaceflight specifically.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Record Backlog in Commercial Aircraft</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Constellium is a major supplier to manufacturers of commercial aircraft, particularly Airbus. There is currently a <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-12-09-02/\" rel=\"nofollow\">massive backlog</a> of 17,000 aircraft (60% of the active fleet), which amounts to 12 years of production at current capacities. Airbus alone has a <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-01-airbus-reports-793-commercial-aircraft-deliveries-in-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">backlog of 8754 aircraft</a> as of the end of 2025. Since Constellium is one of the major suppliers to the commercial aerospace industry, this huge backlog guarantees many years of demand and significant growth potential for the company's A&amp;T products.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. New Market Opportunities</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I wouldn't bet against the company opening up new markets for its products. In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871586-constellium-se-cstm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">most recent earnings call</a>, CEO Ingrid Joerg said</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We also believe there are some opportunities in land-based defense and semiconductor markets given current market dynamics. In most industrial markets, we are focused on niche high value-added applications.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Niche, high value-added applications are where the stronger margins lie. Aluminum and aluminum alloys are in high demand in multiple disruptive industries, like EVs, data centers, green energy, drones, robotics, and more. So this company is poised to expand its product lines to high-growth industries where it can command higher profit margins, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major Risks</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Energy Prices</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM uses an enormous amount of energy for its operations, primarily natural gas and electricity. A rise in these input costs could diminish gross profit margins. The company purchases energy through forward fixed commitments and long-term contracts, which reduces price uncertainty somewhat. However, it would not be immune to an energy price shock. The risk from energy prices could be amplified by the fact that CSTM supplies automotive and aerospace companies. Higher energy prices could reduce demand for air travel and automobiles, which in turn could lead to CSTM's customers placing fewer orders. That risk, however, is tempered by the fact that higher fuel prices would increase demand for lightweight materials, which could be a tailwind to CSTM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I was writing this article, the US and Israel carried out an attack on Iran. If this attack causes an energy price shock, it could be a significant financial burden to the company. As I mentioned, the company is resilient to short-term energy shocks because it locks in so much of its future energy costs in futures and long-term contracts with suppliers. As I mentioned in the Opportunities section, CSTM also uses recycling to derive much of its raw aluminum, which further shields the company from energy price volatility since recycling is so much less energy intensive. Because recycling uses 95% less energy than primary smelting, CSTM has a clear advantage over its competitors in the event of a drawn-out energy price shock, even though it could hurt profitability eventually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, CSTM has shown the ability to pass higher input costs on to customers, which it could potentially do with energy prices as well.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Middleman Risk</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you're a middleman in a supply chain, you face risks from both ends. If CSTM's customers experience a drop in demand, the demand for aluminum products could decrease. However, I think that is unlikely. Aluminum used in consumer staples is likely to experience robust demand, since consumer staples is typically a non-cyclical industry. Aerospace is more cyclical, but the massive backlog for commercial aircraft suggests that demand is unlikely to evaporate any time soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other end, CSTM faces supply-side risk. A geopolitical crisis that shocks aluminum supply could pose a major risk, although the company has proven resilient to President Trump's high tariffs on aluminum. In fact, tariffs have actually benefitted the company tremendously since the aluminum it gets from domestic scrap is tariff-free, but the tariffs push up the price of refined aluminum. So tariffs allow the company to capture a larger spread between the cost of scrap and the selling price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If, however, there was a major supply shock with primary aluminum, that could drive up the price of aluminum scrap metal, which would hurt CSTM on the supply side. The company would burn through cash in a potential supply shock. The vast majority of the world's bauxite mining is done in Australia, China, Brazil, India, and Guinea, while very little mining is done domestically. There is not yet enough recyclable aluminum in circulation to meet demand, which means that continued extraction of bauxite (which gets refined into alumina, then smelted into aluminum) in those countries is vital.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. High Debt</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company does have a worrying amount of debt. Total debt is about $2.06 billion on a market cap of $3.36 billion at the time of writing. Net interest expense was $99 million, only about 8.2% of gross profit and 1.2% of revenues for 2025. The company <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-prices-company-notes-offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">issued bonds in 2024</a> that mature in 2032: €300 million of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes bearing interest of 5.375% and $350 million of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2032 bearing interest of 6.375%. All the company's bonds are <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CSTM/bonds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trading at a premium to par value</a>, meaning the bond market is rating the bonds as lower risk than when they were issued. The company does face refinancing risk when the bonds mature. $325 million worth of notes mature in June 2028, while the rest mature in 2029 and 2032. I believe the company's strong cash flows recently provide an opportunity to decrease leverage, which would further expand margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's balance sheet has significantly strengthened in the past few years, which is another sign that it can manage its debt and that it's on a long trend toward improved solvency. The growth in book value of equity (representing total assets minus total liabilities) over the last few years is evidence of the improving balance sheet: total book value of equity has gone from -600 million in 2016 to -140 million in 2020 to 952 million in the most recent report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So are these risks big enough that they turn our hidden gem into a chunk of coal? I don't believe so. It would be impossible to find any stock with all opportunities and no risks - in other words, a hidden gem with no rough edges. I believe the opportunities I laid out above significantly outweigh the risks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM's stock has been on a roller coaster ride since its IPO in May 2013:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock recently broke out above a longer than 10-year trading range, between about $4 and $22 per share, which I view as a bullish move. In the last year the stock is up nearly 120%, which raises concerns that it could be overbought. But I think the strong valuation metrics counter that concern. One year ago, CSTM had a B+ valuation grade on Seeking Alpha's Quantitative Scorecard, while today it earns an A+ valuation score. If anything, that suggests that the stock price hasn't quite caught up with the improved fundamentals. The relative strength index at ~56 doesn't suggest that the stock is currently overbought either:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moat/Competitive Advantage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Each segment of Constellium's business has significant competitive advantages. One moat comes from its Airware alloys (for the A&amp;T segment). Creating these special alloys requires billions in capital expenditures and decades of R&amp;D. The market is solidly oligopolistic, with only a few major competitors: Howmet Aerospace and Arconic primarily. But this competition (albeit limited) is a positive. Demand is so great that no single company can fill it. The entire pie is growing so fast that any company with 20-30% market share (which Constellium has) is going to see tremendous growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The automotive segment has a large moat because Constellium co-engineers with automakers, making the switching costs high. If an automaker crash tests its vehicles using Constellium's products, then switching the design to use another company's products instead is extremely expensive. It would require an entire redesign and recertification of the vehicle. This is not just generic metal that Constellium is selling to automakers: it takes years of collaborative custom designing to develop these products for companies like BMW and Ford. That said, automakers are extremely cost-sensitive, so although Constellium has a moat in this segment, I believe the aerospace moat is stronger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another moat for the company is in the more boring P&amp;ARP segment. The moat here is volume and capital scale. Manufacturing rolled aluminum for beverage cans is actually much harder than it sounds. It requires flawless metallurgy to ensure that the thin alloys that make up beverage cans can withstand the pressure once they're filled. The monetary barriers to entry in this space are astronomically high. However, CSTM doesn't have the strongest pricing power in this segment, which is evidenced by the extremely low margins relative to the other segments. So although it would be difficult for newcomers to compete, buyers still have strong pricing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I rate CSTM's moat as wide, particularly due to the aerospace segment. The other segments contribute meaningfully, but the proprietary alloys used in aerospace are what give the company its strongest competitive advantage, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I use an EV/EBITDA model to value CSTM. My thesis is that the market is rating CSTM more as a commodity aluminum supplier and not based on the strong moat it has developed through the proprietary Airware aluminum-lithium alloys that are fueling the company's growth in high-margin segments. The forward EV/EBITDA ratio for the company is 6.48 compared to a 9.00 average in the Materials sector. I believe that CSTM should command a multiple higher than the Materials sector average, but to be conservative, I use a value of 9.0 forward EV/EBITDA to value the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553440-constellium-targets-780m-820m-adjusted-ebitda-in-2026-as-vision-2028-launches\">targeting $780-$820 million</a> adjusted EBITDA in 2026. I used the midpoint of that range ($800 million) and a 9.0 multiple to get a fair enterprise value of $7.2 billion. Subtracting net debt of 1.94 billion gets a fair equity value of $5.26 billion. Then dividing by the number of diluted shares of 142 million gives us a fair value per share of about $37, which is an upside of about 48% over the current share price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM is my top pick for 2026 because I see a number of tailwinds for the stock, but I want to emphasize that I'm not necessarily recommending it as a long-term \"buy and hold\" pick. This is an industry in which fortunes can change rapidly, and so the validity of my thesis needs to be continually reevaluated. At the moment, I believe the stars are in alignment for this particular company and that we may have identified a diamond in the rough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><i>Editor's Note:</i></span><i> This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha's </i><i><a target=\"_blank\" url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 2026 Long Idea investment competition</a></i><i>, which runs through February 28.

All of the models continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500 in live forward testing here on Seeking Alpha, and again this year.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">If This is a 2022 Market Repeat, Here is What Happens Next</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, let me be clear that I am not under any illusion that 2026 is identical to 2022, nor that making comparisons of two completely different time periods is not without a myriad of flaws. This article is intended to capture and share a large number of significant similarities and show you what we are doing to beat the markets again this year in our 9th year on Seeking Alpha.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I write this article, the US and Israel are launching air strikes against Iran over the weekend, and I have no idea what future events may unfold from this last day of February. I am reminded that back in February of 2022, the world was shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine that continues as a terrible conflict today, more than four years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The structure of this article will begin with a broad macro perspective that progresses to more sector details and shorter time frames. Within each section I will share some of the models, signals, and portfolios we are using to beat the markets again this year. Any one of these following sections could be an article by itself with much more detail than we discuss daily in our community. Instead, I will let the charts do most of the talking as succinctly as possible.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Macro Perspective</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the macro perspective, I begin with a look at the S&amp;P 500 from 2020 through this past week. Overlayed on the S&amp;P 500 chart are two Fibonacci retracement models comparing past and present similarities with future price supports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This technical price model suggests that market moves follow the Fibonacci sequence, and in downturns, look for supports at the levels indicated. In 2022, the S&amp;P 500 declines followed the retracement to -50% declines around the 3,500 support level, but not before testing the -23.6% level first at 4,200. If such a repeat were to occur in 2026, we would expect the first retracement to the 6,500 support levels as illustrated in the chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2262\" data-height=\"942\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 with fibonacci retracement\" width=\"1280\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>finviz.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have shared in prior market forecast articles about a strong market rotation, there are also other strong macro similarities forming back to 2022.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4856224-new-fed-chair-qe-and-lower-rates-where-the-2026-piotroski-graham-value-stocks-are-hiding\">New Fed Chair, QE &amp; Lower Rates: Where The 2026 Piotroski-Graham Value Stocks Are Hiding</a></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following S&amp;P 500 Growth vs. Value chart from 1994 not only shows the extreme divergence between the two investing approaches but also some similarities forming from 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w640\" alt=\"Growth vs Value on the S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w1536 1536w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>yardeni.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">So How Are We Trading This Macro Perspective?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our long-term portfolios are based on a variety of fundamental and forensic algorithms published in peer-reviewed research that have been well documented over many years to provide positive market alpha over 2-year periods.

Supporting the dividend rotation model is the fact that 7 of 10 selections are up over 12.7% YTD, with fully half the portfolio producing over 20% returns, not including large dividends.

It depends on semiconductors, energy, and critical materials. Explore the ETFs providing exposure to the AI buildout.</em></p> <h2>What Actually Powers AI?</h2> <p>It’s easy to think of AI as<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a purely digital phenomenon built on code and data floating in the cloud. But every model runs on physical hardware, consumes real electricity, and depends on materials that are pulled from the ground.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Training a frontier model like GPT-4 reportedly consumed around 50 gigawatt-hours of energy, which is enough to power San Francisco for three days.<sup>1</sup> And that’s just the training phase. Inference, which is the process of actually serving AI to hundreds of millions of users, demands even more sustained power over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of that computation flows through three critical layers:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Semiconductors</strong> that do the math.</li> <li> <strong>Energy</strong> that keeps the data centers running around the clock.</li> <li> <strong>Strategic metals</strong> embedded in the hardware itself.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When any of those layers hits a bottleneck like a chip shortage, a power constraint, or an export ban on critical minerals, it affects every corner of the AI economy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Can You Invest in the AI Supply Chain?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rather than chasing the handful of software names that dominate AI headlines, investors can target the physical infrastructure that every one of those companies depends on. VanEck offers three ETFs, each mapped to a distinct layer of the AI supply chain.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>ETF</td> <td>Role in AI Supply Chain</td> <td>Why It Matters for AI</td> <td>Why Invest</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/semiconductor-etf-smh\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF - Overview\"><strong>SMH</strong></a></td> <td>The advanced chips: GPUs, AI accelerators, that perform the trillions of calculations behind model training and inference.</td> <td>Hyperscalers are spending hundreds of billions on AI compute.

Before a model can answer a question or generate an image, semiconductors have to process the data, power plants have to keep the servers running, and raw materials have to be mined, refined, and built into hardware. Each layer depends on the one below it. Here’s how the three layers connect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/51b98c14423a4584bfa714e902338059/6872_ai-stack-blog_infographic_2026-02_v3_web.svg\" alt=\"How the AI Supply Chain Works\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: VanEck.

GPUs and custom accelerators handle the trillions of matrix multiplications required to train large language models, generate images, and run autonomous systems. <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608986-semiconductors-and-ai-are-taking-over\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"If You’re Reading This Semiconductors &amp; AI Are Taking Over\">The entire AI wave is, at its core, a semiconductor demand story</a></strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor industry also has a structural <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/videos/what-is-an-economic-moat/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"What Is an Economic Moat?\">moat</a></strong> and only a handful of companies worldwide can manufacture the most advanced chips.

It’s a single way to access the core of the AI buildout.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why AI Needs Reliable Energy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge is that most of the U.S. energy grid was built decades ago. Solar and wind help, but they’re intermittent - and a data center can’t afford to go dark when the wind stops blowing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why nuclear is getting serious attention. Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) have all announced plans to <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839104-ai-impact-surge-nuclear-investments-everything-need-know\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"AI's Impact on the Surge of Nuclear Investments: Everything You Need to Know\">secure nuclear power for their AI infrastructure</a></strong>. The federal government has moved to ease nuclear plant regulations and fund next-generation reactor designs.

The fund tracks the MVIS<sup>®</sup> Global Uranium &amp; Nuclear Energy Index. For investors looking to position for the nuclear renaissance that AI is accelerating, NLR offers a direct way in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Materials Are Important to AI?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870373-copper-and-the-materials-behind-global-electrification\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"Copper and the Materials Behind Global Electrification\"><strong>Every AI chip, server rack, and cooling system is built from a cocktail of specialized metals.</strong></a> Here are a few raw materials that matter most:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Neodymium and dysprosium</strong> power the high-strength permanent magnets inside hard drives, server fans, and cooling pumps.</li> <li> <strong>Copper</strong> carries massive electrical currents through the busbars and wiring that connect clustered AI systems.</li> <li> <strong>Tantalum</strong> goes into the capacitors that regulate voltage in GPUs and memory modules during rapid workload shifts.</li> <li> <strong>Gallium and germanium</strong> are essential for advanced chip fabrication and the high-speed fiber optics inside data centers.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The geopolitical dimension here is hard to ignore. China produces the majority of the world’s rare earths and controls nearly all of the processing capacity. The Chinese government recently imposed export licensing rules that require foreign buyers to disclose end-use applications - effectively restricting access for U.S. defense and advanced technology purchasers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western governments are investing in domestic mining and processing alternatives, but reshoring these supply chains is a multi-year project.

Almost a year ago, in February of 2025, I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4759870-kontoor-brands-helly-hansen-massive-purchase\">evaluated</a> the company's purchase of Helly Hansen. This was<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a massive acquisition, costing shareholders $900 million. However, it opened up the door to the company diversifying into the outdoor and workwear market. As interesting as the transaction was, I remained worried about the valuation of the business and high-interest expenses that would negatively affect cash flows. That resulted in me calling it a ‘hold’ as opposed to a ‘buy.’ Sure enough, my concerns have materialized. Even though recent revenue is up, profitability and cash flows have declined. The company is showing weakness when it comes to profit margins involving its Lee brand, and Helly Hansen really isn't bearing any fruit from a profitability standpoint.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This helps to explain why shares have fallen, dropping 33.1% since my article. Over that same window of time, the S&amp;P 500 is up 12.9%. This return disparity is certainly discouraging, and some investors may view it as an opportunity to jump in on the cheap. But even if we factor in projected synergies associated with Helly Hansen, I don't see any reason to be terribly optimistic at this time. If the stock were any more expensive than it is now, I would probably be a bit bearish. But as things stand, I think that it deserves a ‘hold’ rating still.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think it is necessary, if you are going to be an investor, to be flexible in your thinking. As new data comes in, I like to incorporate it into my thinking in order to decide whether or not a previous thought process or decision made sense. The good news for investors is that we will soon have some new data to go off of. Before the market opens on March 3rd, management will be announcing financial results for the final quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. As we approach that date, the expectation that analysts have is for a surge in revenue and profits. But unfortunately, that will be problematic because of acquisition activity that will ultimately have distorted financial performance. Regardless, investors should keep a close eye on this data because it could prove instrumental in deciding whether an upgrade or even a downgrade is appropriate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trying on Kontoor Brands</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2168\" data-height=\"850\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the company's purchase of Helly Hansen in May of last year, financial performance for windows of time prior to that really isn't all that relevant.

Revenue has managed to increase nicely, climbing from $1.91 billion in 2024 to $2.13 billion at the same time in 2025. This requires some unpacking, though. Obviously, the purchase of Helly Hansen played a large role here. That company went from generating nothing in the way of revenue for Kontoor Brands in 2024 to generating $212.6 million worth in the first nine months of last year. That is a huge lift. But it is worth noting that this is not the only source of revenue growth that the company enjoyed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2294\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also on the rise ended up being its Wrangler segment, with revenue jumping from $1.30 billion to $1.35 billion. Management attributed this growth to broad-based expansion, with sales in the Americas growing 4% year over year and sales in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) regions expanding by 6%. In the Americas, the company benefited from greater wholesale revenue attributable to category growth and a rise in its US licensing and digital wholesale operations. However, the company also enjoyed some expansion when it came to its direct-to-consumer business as e-commerce sales grew. Some of the benefit associated with the EMEA region can be chalked up to a 3% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The rest, meanwhile, involved greater direct-to-consumer demand and wholesale revenue growth that was driven by its digital wholesale business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4836943-kontoor-brands-inc-ktb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">third quarter earnings call</a>, the management team at Kontoor Brands expressed that its Wrangler brand enjoyed its 14th consecutive quarter of market share growth. This included greater demand in its core men's and women's bottoms business. The company also enjoyed a 20% growth rate associated with its female business during the quarter. Collaborative arrangements, such as its partnership with Lainey Wilson, performed very well. And on top of this, its Western category reported high single-digit growth year over year, and the expectation is that additional growth should continue thanks to the brand being represented by some of the top athletes in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2308\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"236\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"236\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Lee. Revenue here actually dropped from $597.1 million to $552.3 million. That is a substantial decline, with management blaming it largely on an 8% drop in revenue in the Americas and a 12% drop in the Asia Pacific region. In the Asia Pacific region, management said that this was primarily the result of inventory management actions by retailers. However, it's clear that overall demand for the brand has dropped. The good news is that management has hope that the picture will turn around. In fact, they said that 2026 will be a ‘transition year’ for Lee. In order to deal with this weakness, the company has been making some big changes. This includes consolidating distribution partners. Specifically, the company has been partnering up with larger, more sophisticated partners that are more capable of investing with the company in order to build and drive the brand as time goes on. Certain inventory actions have also been taken, and the company is investing more heavily in its direct-to-consumer presence for this brand. Hopefully, that will start to bear fruit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2278\" data-height=\"870\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though revenue for the company increased, overall profitability took a hit. Net income dropped from $181.8 million to $153.7 million. There were several contributors to this, one of which was a rise in interest expense from $30.9 million to $42.3 million. However, the company also saw a surge in other costs, with one notable example being its selling, general, and administrative expenses. Those skyrocketed from 31.3% of sales to 34.5%. Some of this increase seems to have been the result of one-time events associated with its purchase of Helly Hansen. However, it's also true that Helly Hansen itself is nowhere near as profitable as the other brands. During the first nine months of 2025, the segment achieved segment profits of just $3.2 million. That translates to an operating margin of 1.5%. By comparison, Wrangler boasts a segment profit margin of 23%. Lee is even better, with the profit margin of 11.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2102\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"270\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2025 in its entirety, management said that revenue would likely be between $3.09 billion and $3.12 billion. And based on the estimates provided by management, we are probably looking at net profits of about $207.8 million, adjusted operating cash flow of $264.6 million, and EBITDA of $327.9 million. Using these estimates and also using the historical results that the company achieved for the 2024 fiscal year, we can see in the chart above how shares are currently priced. However, it is worth noting that the chart in question also includes valuation metrics based on projected synergies and full-year pro forma figures for Helly Hansen as well. This was based primarily on the expectations in my previous article, adjusted for the fact that management is now more optimistic about synergies. Previously, they expected synergies of around $15 million from Helly Hansen. But now they expect those to come in eventually at $25 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2072\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These multiples are not bad. In fact, I would say that they put the company in the fair value range. Relative to other firms, the stock might even be a bit cheap. In the chart above, you can see how the company is valued compared to five other similar enterprises. On both a price-to-earnings basis and on a price-to-operating cash flow basis, only one of the five firms is cheaper than it is. However, on an EV-to-EBITDA basis, three of the companies ended up being cheaper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is one big risk factor here when it comes to the picture moving forward. And this relates to the impact that tariffs could have on the company. The fact of the matter is that most clothing and apparel companies import their goods from other countries. And Kontoor Brands is no exception to this. Management highlighted in their third-quarter earnings call that they expect the impact from tariffs, before factoring in mitigation strategies, to be $135 million for 2026. Some of the mitigation strategies will certainly include cost cutting and changes in sourcing. But investors should expect prices to increase as well. One change that the company made, which was implemented in the third quarter of 2025, was the closure of its Torreon manufacturing facility in Mexico. It's possible that additional asset consolidation will occur as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I stated at the start of this article, management will be announcing financial results for the final quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year before the market opens on March 3rd. At present, analysts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KTB/earnings\">anticipate</a> revenue of $976.2 million. That would mark a big jump over the $699.3 million the company reported a year earlier. Because of acquisition activity, such a move higher in revenue is not unexpected. And it does create some real comparability issues. So what I would urge investors to do is to see the extent to which organic revenue growth might have occurred.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1224\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the table above, you can see profitability metrics for the final quarter of 2024 and an estimate when it comes to not only net profits but also earnings per share. The expectation here is for a significant increase, again almost certainly because of acquisition activity. And with that rise is likely to come stronger cash flows as well. Absent something really unexpected, however, such as strong guidance for the 2026 fiscal year, I am unlikely to turn bullish on the business just yet. But given how the stock is priced at the moment, falling meaningfully short of expectations could certainly trigger a downgrade.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As much as I would love to be bullish about Kontoor Brands, I just can't be right now. The stock is not ridiculously priced and is, in fact, cheap relative to other similar firms. But unfortunately, shares are not cheap enough in light of recent underperformance on the bottom line. I am particularly concerned about tariffs moving forward, even though management said that they do expect to offset most of those through mitigation strategies. Add on top of this that the US consumer is already weak, and I believe that a ‘hold’ rating is truly the most generous rating that I can give the company.</p>",

Most of the debt was carried at 100% of par and unencumbered, until it wasn't. This rattled the credit markets and triggered significant write-offs at large financial institutions like UBS and <strong>Jefferies Financial Group Inc.

However, those fears have spiked again in the back half of February. Events at <strong>Blue Owl Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>)</strong> have ignited a sell-off in that stock and in other more well-known industry names like <strong>Blackstone (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\">BX</a>)</strong> and <strong>KKR &amp; Co.

The first is that the sector is heavily <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/private-credit-software-firms-fall-ai-fears.html?msockid=364e2c764258606d340e3e8343446199\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>exposed</strong></a> to the software sector, as can be seen in Blue Owl's loan book. And this part of the market has been taken out to the woodshed and beaten like a rented mule in recent months on growing fears that AI could disrupt a good chunk of the industry. The sector's downturn can be seen in the chart of the <strong>iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGV\" title=\"iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF\">IGV</a>)</strong>. UBS was out last week <a href=\"https://www.fa-mag.com/news/private-credit-fears-deepen-with-ubs-warning-of-15--defaults-86002.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>stating</strong></a> that if AI triggers an “<em>aggressive</em>” disruption among corporate borrowers, private credit default rates could hit 15%. That is up from the 13% top rate UBS articulated earlier in February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"263\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IGV Stock Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"231\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IGV Stock Chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, following Covid, the Federal Reserve brought rates down to zero and boosted the money supply by roughly 40% over two years. This boosted asset prices substantially and also resulted in many businesses getting funded that properly shouldn't. Or at least not at the rates they were able to float debt. Those loans will need to be refinanced at much higher rates in coming quarters and years. This should boost delinquency and default rates significantly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Private Credit Loan Opportunities\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"903\" height=\"504\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Macro Butler, Zero Hedge</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, following the Great Financial Crisis, regulators made it increasingly challenging for banks to hold riskier assets like leveraged loans and other types of debt. This has spurred the huge growth in private credit, which has filled the void in lending to a lot of these mid-market concerns and towards other debt opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some downsides to this migration that could be much more apparent in the coming months. Private credit is subject to less regulation and transparency than bank loan books. There is also a duration mismatch that seems to be getting more attention recently. Many commercial loans tend to run five to seven years in duration on average, which can become a problem in a private credit fund with quarterly redemptions. One of the reasons Blue Owl had to put a '<em>gate</em>' on one of its funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Public versus Private Debt\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"894\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Macro Butler, Zero Hedge</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, prudent investors should monitor the private credit space closely in the coming months. Be on the lookout for increased mentions of terms like '<em>arm's length transaction,'</em> '<em>counterparty risk,</em>' '<em>payment in kind,'</em> '<em>extend &amp; pretend,'</em> and '<em>mark to market,'</em> as these were common terms leading up to and throughout the Great Financial Crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One should also peruse their portfolio to ensure all holdings are in names with solid balance sheets. If credit markets start to develop increased stress, these might be the kind of stocks that get sold off indiscriminately. I could easily see the markets go further into '<em>risk off</em>' mode in March. In this scenario, defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples should outperform the overall market. This has already been the case here in 2026 as value has outperformed growth by a good margin. This follows three-plus years where the Magnificent Seven accounted for most of the gains in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My portfolio remains positioned quite conservatively. Just under 70% is now in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>covered call</strong></a> holdings around the few stocks in the market I have found with reasonable valuations. That is down from 75% a few weeks ago, as I had several covered call positions expire in the money during February's option expiration date. Almost all the rest of my portfolio is within short-term treasuries and cash awaiting lower entry points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"739\" data-height=\"235\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VIX Stock Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"204\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will continue to nibble upon new covered call opportunities as they present themselves.

The stock is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> hardly alone in this softening, though, with the biggest luxury fashion stocks like Hermès (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HESAY\" title=\"Hermès International Société en commandite par actions\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">HESAY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), LVMH (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVMUY\" title=\"LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">LVMUY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and Richemont (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CFRUY\" title=\"Compagnie Financière Richemont SA\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFRUY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) seeing pullbacks as well (see chart below).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm more concerned about Kering, though, because its past struggles have been exceptional.

Investors responded rather favourably to its recent full-year results. Even though both revenues and profits continued to shrink, the stock was up by 10% on the day of the earnings release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's a very good reason for this. The potential for a return to revenue growth after three years of contraction is beginning to show. Below are the signs that point to the same:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Revenue contraction softens:</strong> Kering's comparable revenues dropped by 10% in 2025, but it was still a slightly smaller contraction than the 12% seen in 2024. Q4 2025 in particular showed encouraging signs as revenue fell by just 3% YoY (Q4 2024: -12%).</li> <li> <strong>Gucci softens less:</strong> The latest numbers for Gucci, which is the biggest contributor to revenues, bringing in 41% of the total in 2025, bear a specific mention. While the full year drop for the brand remained big at 19% (2024: -21%), there was significant improvement in the extent of contraction in Q4 2025. Revenues fell by 10% YoY, compared with 24% YoY in Q4 2024.</li> <li> <strong>Some signs of growth:</strong> Segments like Saint Laurent and Other Houses, which includes brands like Balenciaga, McQueen, and Brioni, showed initial encouraging trends in Q4 2025 too. While Saint Laurent's revenues stabilised (Q4 2024: -8%), Other Houses saw a 3% YoY growth (Q4 2024: -4%). These are important segments, since they together brought in 38% of the company's 2025 revenues, coming quite close to Gucci.</li> <li> <strong>Asia Pacific market gives hope:</strong> While the company's biggest market, Western Europe, with a 30% contribution to revenues in 2025, actually performed worse in 2025, with an 11% revenue drop (2024: -9%), there's hope yet from the Asia Pacific market. It brings in a comparable 29% of the revenues, and saw a drop of 16% in 2025 (2024: -24%), with the extent of decline contracting to 6% YoY in Q4 2025 (Q4 2024: -24% YoY).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2097\" data-height=\"1061\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue trends by brand\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2194\" data-height=\"1062\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue by geography\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but profits are still wanting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is glaringly worse off on the profit front, though, with a margin drop for both recurring operating income and recurring EBITDA (see table below). But the worst news is from the net income front, as the company fell into a loss of EUR 29 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this was only on a reported basis, which Kering points out includes \"non-recurring items mostly related to optimization and restructuring measures\". The recurring attributable net income, which is the company's version of adjusted net income, was better off with an EUR 532 million profit. Even then, the number was less than half that in 2024 and the net margin dropped to 3.6% (2024: 7.1%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1305\" data-height=\"635\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profit indicators\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"311\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that the profit outcomes are weak despite notable cost cutting by Kering. Its costs, which include both cost of sales and operating expenses, shrank by 7.1% over the year. While lower sales could have contributed to this, there was also conscious cost optimisation at play here. As the graphic below shows, the company reduced store numbers along with other measures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"998\" data-height=\"935\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cost optimisation measures\" width=\"640\" height=\"600\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Can 2026 be better?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question now is, whether Kering can see improvements in 2026. The company certainly believes so. As the slide below shows, it expects both a return to growth and better margins. Margins could be improved if costs continue to shrink, which should be expected going by Kering's top priority to \"set a lean organization\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPRUY/earnings/estimates\">Analysts' estimates on Seeking Alpha </a>also confirm the likelihood of revenue growth returning, although only marginally so, with a forecast of just 1.3% growth. It's worth noting, though, that the lowest revenue estimate actually indicates a marginal decline even in 2026. So that's a risk to look out for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings are expected to do better, with nothing short of a 73.8% increase forecast. Although, here too, it's worth pointing out that only one analyst's estimate is available right now. In other words, this doesn't make for a consensus view yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2101\" data-height=\"1209\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Priorities and Outlook for 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market multiples</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optimism about the stock has clearly run ahead of the fundamentals. PPRUY's forward non-GAAP P/E stands at 37.5x right now, which is rather rich. Consider the following:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The stock's five-year average ratio is at 22.9x, indicating that it's overvalued.</li> <li>It's also trading higher than the corresponding multiples for LVMUY and CFRUY at 24x and 27.7x, respectively, which makes it highly priced compared with peers.</li> <li>PPRUY is trading closest to HESAY, which is at 42.8x. But then HESAY routinely trades at a much higher forward ratio that's explained by its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806697-hermes-better-than-expected-revenues-encourage-holding-on\">consistently healthy performance</a> even during slumps.</li> <li>The Swatch Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWGAY\" title=\"The Swatch Group AG\">SWGAY</a>), which has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876492-the-swatch-group-4-reasons-to-buy-now-rating-upgrade\">seen struggles</a> similar to Kering in the recent past, is trading at an impossibly low forward P/E of just 2.3x right now.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point, it's hard to see Kering's price rise significantly again in the immediate future. There's certainly room for optimism, but at a time when the luxury market is yet to take off, there's a risk of revenues remaining soft. As it is, only trivial growth is forecast for 2026. It remains to be seen whether the margins can expand again as well, with this background.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the market valuations are looking quite stretched, indicating that the stock can correct, especially as it is significantly higher priced compared with peers. For now, I'm retaining a hold on PPRUY.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYM\" title=\"Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF\">VYM</a></span>) is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> one such example, with shares of this popular index tracker returning a spritely 8% so far this year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don't be fooled by this fund's name. While it gives off the impression that it's a crude play on yield, VYM's construction methodology is much more balanced than that. What it ultimately produces is a portfolio that looks more like a collection of blue-chip dividend payers than risky high yielders. Admittedly, the fund's focus on dividends can leave it disadvantaged during strong bull markets, as its recent history shows. However, long-term investors looking for a less volatile, low-cost basket of core stocks will find a lot to like here.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Heavy On Blue Chip Dividend Stocks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYM aims to match the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which is a U.S. subset of the broader FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Index. The index starts by deleting companies that have not paid an ordinary dividend in the last 12 months. Those not expected to pay dividends in the next 12 months are also excluded. Real estate investment trusts and mortgage REITs are ineligible regardless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To construct the index, survivors are first ranked, in descending order, by their 12-month forward dividend yield. The highest-yielding stocks are then selected until 50% of the list's total investable market capitalization has been reached. Finally, constituents are weighted by their investable market cap. Reconstitution occurs twice a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can probably see, this process will sweep in larger dividend-paying companies that may not necessarily have the highest yields. Weighting by market cap then emphasizes these stocks in the index, mitigating the risks that could arise from smaller yield traps. Finally, the index employs buffer rules to reduce turnover, with existing constituents only removed once they fall beyond the 55th percentile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's largest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYM/holdings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYM/holdings\" target=\"_blank\">holdings</a> illustrate this, with household blue chips like JPMorgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>), Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>), Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>), Procter &amp; Gamble (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG\" title=\"The Procter &amp; Gamble Company\">PG</a>), Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>), Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>), McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>), and PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>) all making the top 20-30 holdings. Per Vanguard, the median market cap of the portfolio is a hefty $175 billion (that is to say, stocks with market caps above this level account for half of the fund's assets), with the weighted average market cap clocking in at over $300 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The index's methodology and buffer rules throw up some other points worth considering. Firstly, the largest companies tend to stick around in the portfolio. The eight stocks mentioned above, for example, have consistently been among the fund's largest holdings in recent years, rarely falling out of the top 20.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1142\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF % of Portfolio In JPM, JNJ, XOM, PGC, CVX and KO (Jan 31 2020 - Jan 31 2026)\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data Source: Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, mega-cap stocks do find themselves exiting the fund from time to time. An example of this would be Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) in 2023, whose dividend yield collapsed on the back of its stunning Mounjaro-driven share price surge.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, selecting stocks until half of the total investable market value has been included results in a relatively high number being admitted. The fund currently holds over 550 names, with the top 10 accounting for around 25% by weight. This makes VYM less top-heavy than composite indices like the Russell 1000 or S&amp;P 500, both of which are dominated by big tech firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thirdly, screening by yield does give the fund a value tilt. Per <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vym\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vym\" target=\"_blank\">Vanguard</a>, the portfolio's current price-to-earnings ratio is just over 21.1x, representing a roughly 25% discount to the Russell 1000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, employing dividend-based screens means the fund can look very different from broader-based strategies. Unsurprisingly, the fund is underweight technology compared to composite indices. It is overweight staples. Overall, there is only a 34% overlap by weight between VYM and the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>). While the fund bears closer resemblance to its category benchmark, overlap with the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>) is still only 55%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Less Bumpy Ride</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above also has implications for the fund's performance. Given its value tilt, this ETF can lag composite funds during bull markets. This has been a feature of its recent history, as returns trailed the Russell 1000 for three straight calendar years between 2023 and 2025.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, its focus on mature dividend payers typically makes for a less bumpy ride across an entire cycle. The absence of non-dividend payers and the lower-yielding half of its universe hasn't resulted in underperformance against its category average, either. On the contrary, VYM has significantly outperformed the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF since its inception in 2006, with lower volatility and a higher average dividend yield to boot.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, the fund has underperformed the composite index in that time, although I think some context may be useful here. The latter does, of course, contain growth stocks. These have gotten more expensive in recent years relative to the value universe, which has been a tailwind that VYM has lacked. Suffice to say that this trend can also work in reverse, and this could benefit the fund.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1240\" data-height=\"606\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Relative Forward PE Ratios Russell 1000 Growth / Russel 1000 Value (2012 - 2025)\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data Source: Siblis Research</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $154.93, VYM trades for around 21 times its holdings' earnings. Its distribution yield is currently running well below its historical norm. I think you could look at this in two ways. On the one hand, none of this makes the fund cheap on an intrinsic basis. On the other hand, while value stocks have gotten more expensive, they still haven't seen the same degree of valuation uplift as growth stocks. That being the case, I expect VYM to hold up <em>relatively</em> well.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, fees are a standout feature of this fund. The expense ratio here is just 4 basis points after its <a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguard-delivers-landmark-cost-savings.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguard-delivers-landmark-cost-savings.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent reduction</a>, a level that only a handful of ETFs can beat. And with over $70 billion in assets under management, VYM is large enough to ensure that it will be around for years to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF is more sophisticated than its name may suggest. By including half of eligible stocks and weighting by market cap, it is more like a blue-chip dividend fund than a high-yield one. While the fund can lag blended strategies in periods of strongly rising markets, it has a solid track record against its category, while an expense ratio of less than 5 basis points is hard to beat. For investors seeking a more conservative way to own stocks, VYM could be the ideal candidate.</p>",

CrowdStrike (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">CRWD</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and Zscaler (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZS\" title=\"Zscaler, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">ZS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) also dropped about 10% on the news. The financials sector fell more than 3% as American Express (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP\" title=\"American Express Company\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXP</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), Goldman Sachs, and Blackstone (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">BX</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) came under pressure on fears that AI could automate large portions of their businesses. A widely circulated Citrini Research piece warning of 10% AI-driven unemployment gave bears a macro narrative.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet the <em>“AI kills everything”</em> narrative ignores what the data actually shows: companies are integrating AI, not dying from it. McKinsey’s 2025 State of AI survey found 88% of firms already use AI in at least one business function, up from 78% a year prior, while by Q1 2026, that figure reached 78% of U.S. corporations scaling AI enterprise-wide, according to Netguru. Salesforce’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>) Q4 2026 earnings showed over 22,000 Agentforce deals closed in the quarter, with combined AI and Data Cloud ARR surging to $1.8 billion from $1.4 billion just three months earlier, proving enterprise buyers are choosing to buy AI tools from incumbents rather than be replaced by them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deloitte’s 2026 State of AI in the Enterprise report found that two-thirds of organizations already report productivity and efficiency gains, while a Harvard study showed that consultants using AI completed tasks 25% faster and at 40% higher quality, augmentation, not elimination. Goldman Sachs Research estimates AI-driven productivity could lift global GDP by 7% <em>(roughly $7 trillion)</em> and sees the next phase of the AI trade rotating precisely toward <em>“productivity beneficiaries,”</em> the non-tech companies that harness AI to widen margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, LPL Research notes that BLS data already shows real output rising 5.4% while hours worked grew just 0.5%, and that only 5.7% of U.S. job hours currently involve generative AI, meaning the largest productivity gains are still ahead, not behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The crucial point to consider is that the IBM selloff and SaaS panic of this year may ultimately look less like the beginning of a displacement cycle and more like the kind of reflexive fear that preceded every prior wave of technological adoption. We have seen this same cycle, from ATMs <em>(which </em><em>reduced bank teller employment) </em>to cloud computing <em>(which expanded, not destroyed, enterprise software)</em>. Notably, the companies that adapt capture outsized value, and the ones that don’t were already failing for other reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main event came on Wednesday after the close. Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) reported fiscal Q4 revenue of $68.1 billion, beating the $65.9 billion consensus by 3.3%. Notably, it guided Q1 to $78 billion, well above the $72.8 billion estimate. Data center revenue totaled $62.3 billion, up 75% year over year. However, the stock still fell 5% on Thursday as investors flagged a lack of detail on lingering China uncertainty. However, Nvidia currently trades at a deep discount to the broad market index. While the S&amp;P trades near 22x earnings, Nvidia’s forward PE is 17x with a 0.45 price-to-earnings-growth ratio. With EPS expected to grow by 39.2% over the next 5 years, the fundamentals are compelling. By focusing on a possible future event that may or may not occur, they may miss a fundamentally strong company trading at a discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big risk worth watching is that tariff policy remains in legal limbo after the SCOTUS ruling. The AI disruption narrative is broadening beyond software into financials and logistics. And the extreme rotation into Energy, Materials, and Industrials <em>(up 21%, 17%, and 12%, respectively)</em> has left positioning dangerously one-sided against Technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Resilience is not the same as safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which brings us to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technical Backdrop</strong><span> – </span><strong>Technology Gets Tripped Up</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 closed Friday at <strong>6,878</strong>, marking a second consecutive down session. From a pure trend perspective, the market remains in a <strong><em>bullish primary uptrend</em></strong>. But it is clearly struggling within the February consolidation range. The index sits below both its 20-DMA (~6,896) and 50-DMA (~6,899), which have crossed. That bearish crossover acts as overhead resistance rather than support. Every rally attempt in February has stalled in the 6,950–7,000 zone, while every pullback has found buyers near the 100-DMA and the lower consolidation range around 6,831.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1577\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MACD chart\" width=\"1280\" height=\"986\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Heading into March, seasonal data provides <strong><em>a positive tailwind</em>.</strong> Since 1964, the S&amp;P 500 has posted an average price return of approximately +1.1% during March. That makes it one of the better-performing calendar months. March also falls within the traditionally favorable <em>“best six months”</em> window <em>(November through April)</em>. Historically, this period outperformed the May–October stretch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Monthly return stats for S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"700\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there is a critical asterisk: <strong>2026 is a midterm election year.</strong> Midterm years carry a well-documented pattern of elevated volatility and muted returns <strong>during the first half of the calendar year.</strong> According to Motley Fool, the S&amp;P 500 has returned an average of just +1% during midterm election years. It has also historically suffered an average intra-year drawdown of roughly 18%. When a new president takes office, as is the case now, the average midterm-year return drops to approximately ~7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the overall market, momentum indicators are <strong>deteriorating on the short-term time frame.</strong> However, they remain supportive on an intermediate- to long-term basis. The 14-day RSI stands at approximately 48. That is firmly in neutral territory, and well off the highs when the index was testing 7,000. The RSI is not yet oversold (below 30), which means the index has room to drift lower. Notably, the market is flirting with the bottom of its recent consolidation range and the 100-day moving average, where a break lower could draw more selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bottom line: </strong>The bull trend is intact, but the<em> “easy money”</em> phase appears mature. The intermediate-to-long-term structure remains constructive. The 200-DMA is rising, breadth is near record levels, and the rotation trade is broadening participation. However, short-term momentum has deteriorated notably. The index is below both its 20- and 50-DMAs, the MACD has crossed bearishly, and the RSI is declining. Layer in the midterm election year seasonal headwinds, hotter-than-expected inflation, and Iran-related geopolitical risk, and <em><strong>the path of least resistance in early March tilts toward further consolidation or a modest pullback before the seasonal tailwinds attempt to reassert themselves.</strong></em> I suspect we will get a better entry point for a rally as we move into March. However, use that opportunity to rebalance oversized winners, define risk levels, and avoid chasing strength. Don’t fight the trend, but protect gains if volatility inevitably returns.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Level Type</strong></td> <td><strong>Price Zone</strong></td> <td><strong>Technical Significance</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Immediate Resistance</strong></td> <td>6,950 – 7,000</td> <td>Psychological round-number resistance.

On the macro side, the week is bookended by two critical reads on the economy. ISM Manufacturing PMI lands Monday morning, after January’s surprise jump to 52.6 (the first expansion in 12 months), markets will scrutinize whether that rebound was genuine or simply a post-holiday reorder effect distorted by tariff front-running. A print below 50 would revive contraction fears and likely pressure cyclicals and small caps; a firm reading above 52 would reinforce the reflation narrative that has lifted Energy, Materials, and Industrials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wednesday is the ADP Employment Report and ISM Services PMI. Services never entered contraction, and ADP has shown a recovery in employment as of late. Then on Friday, the February Employment Situation (Nonfarm Payrolls) caps the week and will set the tone heading into mid-March. The key number will be the wage growth component; if average hourly earnings accelerate, it could push out rate-cut expectations and weigh on rate-sensitive sectors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings will also move the market next week: <strong>CrowdStrike (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\">CRWD</a>)</strong> reports after the close on Tuesday - the cybersecurity bellwether will offer a key read on enterprise security spend and the penetration of its Falcon Flex model. The market has priced in roughly a ±10% earnings move, so guidance will be the real catalyst. On Wednesday, <strong>Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>)</strong> reports its fiscal Q1 2026 results with consensus revenue estimates near $19.2 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focus will be squarely on AI semiconductor revenue (guided to $8.2B for the quarter), custom ASIC demand from hyperscalers, and infrastructure software margins. Given the recent selloff in semis, a strong guide-up could reignite the AI trade. Thursday is <strong>Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>)</strong> and <strong>Marvell Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL\" title=\"Marvell Technology, Inc.\">MRVL</a>)</strong>, both reporting after the bell. Costco’s comparable sales trends and membership fee income will set the tone for the consumer, while Marvell’s data center revenue trajectory and Celestial AI integration update will add another data point to the AI infrastructure narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Events\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"844\" height=\"636\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Market Topping Process?

However, those growth names are where the earnings and revenue growth reside. With that in mind, the next rotation could be from defensive names back to growth names, which are now trading at significantly lower forward PEs. Such a rotation would be exactly what often happens, as no one currently expects it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Forward P/E\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"564\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it isn’t a market top, then is the recent rotation out of growth and into defensive sectors merely the kind of healthy digestion that precedes a further leg higher?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the questions we will dig into today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Case for a Top: What the Bears See</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 has spent recent weeks grinding in a range that has tested the patience of both bulls and bears. More notable than the index’s headline price action has been the dramatic shift beneath the surface: utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples have led the tape, while the mega-cap technology stocks that powered the bulk of the post-2022 rally have stalled or retreated. The Nasdaq 100’s underperformance relative to the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 has reached levels not seen since the first quarter of 2022, a period that, it bears noting, preceded a punishing bear market leg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1577\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500\" width=\"1280\" height=\"986\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For market technicians, the pattern is uncomfortably familiar. Market-topping processes throughout history, from 2000 to 2007 to 2021, have been preceded by precisely this kind of internal deterioration: narrowing leadership, defensive outperformance, and a growing divergence between price-weighted and breadth-based indicators. The question is whether history is rhyming again, or whether the analogy is misleading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most compelling argument that equities are in a market-topping process begins with the market’s internal structure. <strong>When investors rotate aggressively into utilities, staples, and healthcare sectors prized for their dividend yields and earnings stability rather than their growth prospects, it is typically a signal that institutional capital is seeking shelter.</strong> Money doesn’t move into Procter &amp; Gamble (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG\" title=\"The Procter &amp; Gamble Company\">PG</a>) and Duke Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>) because portfolio managers are feeling adventurous. It moves there because they are seeking relative safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The breadth picture reinforces this concern. The percentage of S&amp;P 500 constituents trading above their 200-day moving average has been declining even as the index itself has held near its highs, a classic negative divergence. We also see the same negative divergence in the market’s relative strength measures. In past market-topping processes, such divergences have preceded meaningful corrections by 2 to 6 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPX chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"900\" height=\"673\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then there is the yield curve. After a prolonged inversion that began in 2022, the curve’s re-steepening in late 2024 and into 2025 prompted some relief among investors who viewed the normalization as a sign the recession everyone feared had been avoided. But historically, the most dangerous period for equities is not during the inversion itself; it is in the 12 to 18 months after the curve un-inverts. The logic is straightforward: the curve steepens because the Fed is cutting rates in response to slowing growth, and the lagged effects of prior tightening are still working through the economy. By the time the damage becomes visible in earnings, the market-topping process has likely been completed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Yield inversion reversals are recession signal\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"840\" height=\"518\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, credit markets, while not yet flashing red, are showing early signs of strain. Investment-grade and high-yield spreads have widened modestly from their tightest levels, and dispersion within the high-yield market, particularly in private credit, has increased. Historically, credit leads equities, and the subtle deterioration in risk appetite in fixed income is difficult for equity bulls to dismiss entirely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1663\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Treasury bond to yield spread\" width=\"1280\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let’s also discuss the bull case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Case for a Base: What the Bulls See</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull case is not built on dismissing the rotation into defensives but on reframing it. Proponents of the view that the market is building a base, rather than a market-topping process, and point out that leadership transitions within a bull market are not inherently bearish. In fact, some of the healthiest and most durable advances in market history have been accompanied by exactly the kind of broadening and rotation currently underway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider the precedent of 2016. After a narrow, FANG-led rally in 2015, the market experienced a gut-wrenching correction in early 2016 driven by growth fears and an oil price collapse. What followed was not a bear market but a powerful rotation: value outperformed growth, small caps outperformed large caps, and the equal-weight index began to lead. As shown, that outperformance remained intact for nearly 36 months before it failed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPX chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key distinction, then, is between rotation that signals deterioration and rotation that signals broadening. The former typically occurs alongside falling earnings estimates and rising unemployment claims. The latter occurs when the economy is resilient enough to support a wider set of winners.<strong> On this score, the fundamental backdrop remains constructive. </strong>Aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for the forward twelve months have continued to grind higher, not lower, which is a crucial differentiator from the pre-recession environments of 2000 and 2007, when estimates were rolling over well before the index peaked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1133\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPS forward estimate\" width=\"1280\" height=\"725\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The labor market, while cooling from its post-pandemic tightness, has avoided the kind of abrupt deterioration that typically precedes a recession.

The Federal Reserve’s pivot toward accommodation, whether through actual rate reductions or a clear willingness to ease if conditions warrant, provides an important backstop. Historical analysis from Ned Davis Research shows that when the Fed eases into an environment of positive earnings growth, the S&amp;P 500 has posted gains in more than 80% of the subsequent 12-month periods. <strong>The combination of falling rates and rising earnings is, statistically, one of the most favorable macro regimes for equities.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The technical picture, while mixed, is not uniformly bearish either. The S&amp;P 500 remains above its rising 52-week (1-year) and 208-week (4-year) moving averages. That 52-week moving average has been a consistent bullish <em>“line in the sand”</em> that, when lost and confirmed, has historically been one of the most reliable signals that a cyclical bear market is underway. As long as that trend anchor holds, the benefit of the doubt arguably belongs to the bulls. <strong>The most important trend line is the 208-week moving average. If that fails, the bears will have control of the market.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPX chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1240\" height=\"928\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, sentiment indicators have swung sharply toward pessimism during the recent rotation, with the AAII bull-bear spread, the put-call ratio, and the CNN Fear and Greed Index all at levels that historically don’t suggest a market-topping process is underway.

The ongoing buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure, the reshoring of manufacturing supply chains, and the capital expenditure cycle across the energy transition represent multi-year tailwinds for corporate earnings that extend well beyond the mega-cap technology cohort. If the AI investment cycle is broadening from the hyperscalers to the enterprise software layer and the industrial economy, then the rotation could have further to go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, which side do you pick?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Verdict: Healthy Skepticism, Not Conviction</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets rarely announce their intentions clearly, and the current environment is no exception. The bearish case rests on pattern recognition, the eerie similarity between today’s internal deterioration and the breadth collapses that preceded the last three major market topping processes, and on the arithmetic of valuation, which suggests that the margin of safety for equity investors is thinner than it has been in over two decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bullish case rests on fundamentals that remain, for now, constructive: earnings are growing, the Fed is friendly, the labor market is intact, and sentiment is depressed enough to provide contrarian fuel. History shows that expensive markets with rising earnings can stay expensive far longer than value-oriented bears expect, and that defensive rotations within a secular uptrend are more often buying opportunities than exit signals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The honest answer is that the market is at an inflection point where the evidence supports both interpretations. <strong>What will resolve the debate is not opinion, but price</strong>. As such, investors should pay close attention to key market levels, as noted in the Technical Update above.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>The 100-day moving average remains a key bullish trend support.</em></li> <li><em>The 200-day moving average is a critical support level for markets during a corrective process.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the market breaks below the 100-day moving average, the market-topping process will likely be confirmed. If that happens, the next question for the bulls will be whether the S&amp;P 500 can hold its 200-day average. The bulls, on the other hand, will need to see the market eventually confirm all-time highs on broader participation. A bull market cannot last without the major sectors of Financials, Technology, and Healthcare providing support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> There is currently no evidence to suggest that the current rotation is the opening act of a more ominous distribution phase. However, that does not mean the evidence won’t eventually manifest. Therefore, investors who position dogmatically for a specific outcome are taking a lower-probability bet than those who remain flexible, watch the key levels, and let the tape itself provide the answer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the old market adage goes: <strong><em>the trend is your friend until it bends. </em></strong>The trend has not yet broken. But it is bending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Market Statistics &amp; Analysis</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Weekly technical overview across key sectors, risk indicators, and market internals</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Market &amp; Sector X-Ray: Pullback To Support</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite what seemed like a market-topping process, most sectors and markets outside technology remain in overbought territory on a short-term basis. Energy, Materials, Industrials, and Staples, or rather <em>“value,”</em> have strongly outperformed every other market and sector this year. These areas are the most overbought, and a rotation back to growth seems increasingly obvious, but momentum is a hard thing to kill. Take profits and rebalance portfolios accordingly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1179\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technical Composite: 69.47 – Overbought Conditions Continue To Ease</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall technical condition remains bullish as the market remains stuck in a consolidation range. One argument against a market-topping process is that price consolidation is easing the previous overbought conditions. I continue to suspect we will get a better entry point for a rally as we get into March. However, as noted above, this weakness is very selective and is driven by Technology, Communications, and Financials. The next market rally will likely be driven by a rotation into these areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical composite\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1116\" height=\"570\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fear/Greed Index: 72.80 – Greed Remains (In Certain Sectors)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning in equities remained strong this week, driven by continued strength in Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Energy as noted above.

The moves may signal a diminishing appetite for risk-on assets as investors reassess growth expectations and adjust their economic outlooks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The new feature, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claude Code Security</a>, scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests patches, raising concerns that AI-driven development tools could reduce reliance on certain third-party solutions. The pullback has escalated the debate over AI displacement, with some seeing the advancements as threatening to cyber firms while others argue the market reaction has been largely panic-driven.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“We believe these stocks selling off is all on the ‘AI Ghost Trade’ fears… but it will prove to be the wrong reaction in the long-term for clear winners such as Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler as they prove it out in 2026 in our view,” Wedbush analysts <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-claude-code-security-launch-200400637.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in a note</a>.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a sharp escalation on Friday, U.S. federal agencies were ordered to immediately cease using Anthropic’s technology following months of acrimonious disputes with the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5725327/pentagon-anthropic-hegseth-safety\" rel=\"nofollow\">vowed</a> to blacklist Anthropic if the U.S. could not have unrestricted military use of its AI technology in a “lawful” manner, which included warfare and surveillance. In a Truth Social post, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116144552969293195\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“...I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic's technology. We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again!\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The high-stakes AI battle happens to coincide on the heels of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558949-trump-confirms-us-began-major-combat-operation-against-iran\">airstrikes</a> carried out by Israel and the U.S. across Iran. Iran is a global oil producer and a founding member of OPEC. Ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran and three failed rounds of U.S.-Iran nuclear program talks have resulted in no deal, and now, the nations are engaging in major combat. Amid the news, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, secured a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to deploy its models within a classified government network. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558951-openai-lands-pentagon-deal-after-anthropic-standoff\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“Tonight, we reached an agreement with the Department of War to deploy our models in their classified network. In all of our interactions, the DoW displayed a deep respect for safety and a desire to partner to achieve the best possible outcome. Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems. The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement. We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we monitor the latest news and developments, for those seeking cybersecurity exposure, the recent volatility underscores the importance of focusing on fundamentals and quantitative metrics that remove emotion from investing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How I Chose Top Cybersecurity Stocks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I pulled holdings from the three largest cybersecurity-focused ETFs by assets under management and ran them through the Quant Ratings System.

Some analysts argue that AI will boost cybersecurity stocks in the long run and the market has overrated to the headlines.

The stock has more than tripled to current levels from the March lows of ~$6, despite giving back most<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of its gains after spikes over $40 in October 2025, and another in January, which tested highs around ~$32. The company has been propelled by a string of government funding announcements and a separate $1.5B private placement. However, its fundamental story is lacking and based on speculation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_a4b864813b2bb0e288761101bcaf8b2b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_a4b864813b2bb0e288761101bcaf8b2b.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_a4b864813b2bb0e288761101bcaf8b2b.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_a4b864813b2bb0e288761101bcaf8b2b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pre-revenue with an enlarging cost base</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from a short trading history (&lt;1 year), USAR remains a company with no revenue. During the first three quarters of 2025, no sales were recorded, while adjusted operating expenses have climbed from $8.8M in 2Q25 to $8.9M in 3Q25. This excludes the $3.2M in stock-based compensation, M&amp;A costs, and severance pay. The management expects 4Q25 adjusted OPEX to reach $13M-$15M, reflecting an accelerated hiring spree and commissioning activity at its Stillwater plant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we steer back to GAAP, we have to work with a noisy set of data. The net loss in 3Q25 was in fact $156.7M, or -$1.64 per share. This was mainly due to a $142M non-cash fair value adjustment on warrant and earn-out liabilities. In 2Q25, GAAP net loss was $142.5M, or -$1.54/share. The net loss is persistent with growing costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company finished the third quarter with $257.6M cash in hand and no significant debt. Operating cash flow burn was $21.1M during the first three quarters of 2025. Capex spend has been steadily increasing—$3M/$3.2M/$7.1M in 1Q/2Q/3Q of FY25. This was primarily for improving plant and equipment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recapitalization keeps it going</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January 2026, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/usa-rare-earth-announces-closing-120100873.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">USAR closed</a> a $1.5B PIPE deal, and issued 69.8M shares at $21.50, with Inflection Point as the anchor investor. Later in the same month, the company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/usa-rare-earth-enters-pact-for-1-6-billion-of-federal-funds-22626027\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a non-binding letter of intent with the U.S. Department of Commerce's CHIPS program, which led to up to $1.6B in funding that consists of $277M in proposed grants and $1.3B in senior secured loans. In return, 16.1M shares and ~17.6M warrants were issued to the DoC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The obvious drawback is dilution. As of the end of January, there were ~217.9M in outstanding shares, with up to 76.3M shares listed for resale, or about 35% of the total float. The share dilution effect is a strong overhang on the stock, as evidenced by the 12% drop in the share price on the PIPE closing day.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reducing reliance on China's rare earth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's Stillwater plant in Oklahoma is a magnet manufacturing plant expected to be in commission in 1Q26. The initial production rate is 600 metric tons/annum (tpa), before scaling to 1200 tpa, and finally to a full capacity of 4,800 tpa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">USAR acquired the UK's Less Common Metals (LCM) in November 2025 for $100M in cash and 6.54M in shares. This acquisition will bring in 1,500 tpa of NdFeB strip cast capacity, expanding to 2,000 tpa in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fueled by geopolitical fears</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After China <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions\" rel=\"nofollow\">imposed</a> export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements in April 2025, it further expanded them in October 2025 and subsequently suspended the latter until November 2026. China's RE magnet exports fell by ~75% in the two months following the initial controls, and as a result, neodymium prices have <a href=\"https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/neodymium-prices/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\">surged</a> roughly <span>124%</span> since January 2025, to $214.80/kg in February 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is a neodymium price chart in CNY (¥).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"734\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Neodymium price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Neodymium price <span>(Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence.\"</p> <p>Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick (<a href=\"https://nam.org/commerce-department-injects-6-billion-into-domestic-rare-earths-35594/\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only is the funding pipeline credible, but it has garnered bipartisan support as it is a national urgency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let's pause and look at fundamentals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gap between the company's aspirational <a href=\"https://investors.usare.com/static-files/504a8a9a-b867-4a1b-bee4-99b651cb0144\" rel=\"nofollow\">targets</a> (pp. 10) and execution is still pretty wide. By 2030, the management expects to hit $2.6B in revenue, $1.2B in EBITDA, and $900M in FCF. So far, market analysts have only put FY26E revenue at ~$51M, increasing to $281M in FY27E and to $858M in FY28E. EBITDA is not expected to turn positive until FY28E when it will reach $62M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of 3Q25, the Stillwater plant has yet to produce its first magnet, let alone being able to manufacture at scale. Any further status update on its timeline to begin commissioning in 1Q26 would be welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its Round Top deposit in West Texas, which has heavy rare earths, gallium, and other critical minerals waiting to be extracted, still has to pass its pre-feasibility study, aimed to be done by 3Q26. Thus, we do not expect any revenue contribution here until at least 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic viability of domestic RE producers rests strangely on the actions of China.</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As China's export control on REs has sparked urgency on domestic suppliers, the spigot is still very much under the control of China. A relaxation of its supply can cause rare earth prices to crash, as with any commodity. China has shown that it will use its dominance in rare earths as a negotiation tactic in trade talks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A competitive landscape</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MP Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>) is a larger competitor valued at $10.4B, has ~$276M in revenue in the past twelve months. It operates the sole active rare earth mine in North America. It also has close ties with the Department of War. However, USAR has an edge in heavy rare earths, which MP doesn't produce at scale. Despite this, MP still has multiple years of a head start and is expected to turn a profit as early as FY26E, according to market estimates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current levels, USAR trades at 36x FY26E earnings, which is high for an industrial miner, but possibly justifiable since rare earths are a sensitive, politicized commodity. Looking further out at $858M in FY28E revenue, the market estimates imply an FY28E P/S of 2.1x. We sense that this valuation is still on the expensive side—market estimates ($62M EBITDA on $858M revenue) imply a 29x FY28E EV/EBITDA multiple, whereas industrial miners tend to trade below 10x EV/EBITDA even during bull markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, dilution is a big overhang for the stock. There are still $280M+ of warrants to be exercised on the balance sheet. The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1970622/000197062226000009/usar-20260128.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">SEC filings</a> contain risk factors that explicitly mention \"significant dilution associated with the expected U.S. Government investment and PIPE transaction.\" Management has indicated it will need additional capital to fund the full four-line buildout at Stillwater (at least $250M in capex plus $50M-$100M in working capital) and the Round Top development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are not bearish on domestic rare earth suppliers due to geopolitical tailwinds, significant government support and funding, and ultimately the strategic importance of such minerals to defense, EVs, wind, and semiconductors. That said, current valuations are off-putting, and we believe more production milestones need to be reached for us to consider an investment that targets profitability in FY28+.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We rate USAR as a HOLD. We look forward to its next earnings release on March 19 to learn more about its progress at Stillwater.</p>",
