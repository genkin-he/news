Looking at the longer term, we see $1.9 billion in acquisitions over the past 6 years compared to over $1.3 billion sold over the past 5 years, which is definitely a massive amount considering the company's size, although falling occupancy rates probably offset this for now, making a potential recovery even better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One such move is the recent acquisition of the Legacy Union Parking Garage at 720 South Church Street in Charlotte <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/319093197/files/doc_news/Highwoods-Acquires-Legacy-Union-Parking-Garage-at-720-South-Church-Street-in-Charlotte-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">for a $111.5 million total investment</a>, supporting their owned Legacy Union office, whose customers represent ~70% of the annual revenue, leased on a long-term basis with a remaining contractual term of 9 years.

Naturally, these have very significant effects, especially on REITs, being great for them in several ways. The effects of rate hikes/cuts are ultimately the reason behind the central bank’s decisions, made in an effort to steer the economy and fight inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I know this may seem like common knowledge for most of you, but I’m surprised by how many people I’ve seen (especially in recent months) that call REITs bad because they underperformed in recent years as rates were hiked. I like REITs as an asset class and I believe they can serve essential roles in many portfolios, so it’s a shame for someone to pass on these ideas thinking they’re bad just because they performed as they should in a high-rate environment. This is ultimately what this asset class is supposed to do because the business model is almost all about interest rates, basically playing with the spread between their cost of debt and return on their leases/investments—the difference being what they give back to us as shareholders, a bit of capital for investing/other uses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, not only do they reduce the interest expenses on the company’s debt (HIW’s interest expenses got to a record of ~$150 million TTM), having a direct impact on the company’s AFFO and other metrics, but they can also help the tenants in similar ways, providing improved financial flexibility in a time when many businesses need it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the market’s seems quite pessimistic around the US economy, although we’ve seen some improvements lately with Trump’s sanctions on Russia, India and China’s halt of Russian oil acquisitions, etc., but that’s more about global trade and we’re still looking at what is so far the second-largest government shutdown, huge levels of debt, renewed trade war fears, and more risks that can stem from these factors. For example, I see that the market is also worried that the <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/28/shutdown-means-less-data-for-fed-interest-rate-decision\" rel=\"nofollow\">shutdowns can result in less data for the Fed</a> to base its interest rate decisions on, which can lead to an uncertain position as Powell may be inclined to go for a more careful approach, potentially affecting the expectations for 2 more rate cuts this year. And that’s on top of the significant political uncertainty felt in this environment, potentially leading to a bad or even worse scenario for this asset class.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1461\" data-height=\"829\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Highwoods Properties IR HIW stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Highwoods Properties IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This macro pressure is also felt in the company’s operations, with some of the lowest occupancy rates in recent history.

I’ll assume a WACC of 7.5% (above my estimated ~7.21% based on a cost of equity of ~9% and 5.5% cost of debt), with $3.44 billion worth of net debt plus preferred on 110.52 million shares outstanding as of the Q3 report. This way, we get to an enterprise value of $8.19 billion, meaning an equity value of $4.75 billion, for a price of $42.98, basically getting us to the levels from before the rate hikes and industry’s slump began.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I rate HIW a Buy given their quality, good margin of safety, and solid performance despite the industry’s headwinds, while also providing a good dividend. Risk remains especially in this environment, but the company’s solid fundamentals and attractive price should offset it once rate cuts advance and the economy recovers.</p>",

After several months of increasing headline inflation, the just-released inflation data points to a trend reversal. Headline inflation, according to the national measure, decreased to 2.3% year-on-year in October, from 2.4% YoY in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> September. The European measure also came down to 2.3% YoY. Core inflation remained unchanged at 2.8% YoY, while services inflation even increased somewhat to 3.5% YoY, from 3.4% YoY.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Moving towards 2%</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The available regional state data shows that the drop in German inflation was mainly driven by favourable base effects. On the month, almost all categories saw prices slightly increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the stronger euro and still-favourable energy base effects should push German inflation back towards - and below - 2% over the coming months. At the same time, the worsening labour market and AI will further moderate wage growth. Finally, US tariffs could also bring disinflationary pressures to Europe due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US. While these elements clearly bring disinflationary forces to Germany over the coming months, the longer-term picture brings more upward pressure on inflation. Restructuring of supply chains, labour costs in an era of ageing and the green transition remain three important structural drivers of price pressures. And not to forget, the inflationary impact from Germany’s fiscal stimulus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, today’s inflation reading marks another turning point and the start of at least a short-lived period of rather disinflationary pressures before inflationary forces take over again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

EM stocks rallied and broadly outperformed developed markets as trade tensions generally subsided, the euphoria around artificial intelligence ('AI') persisted and expectations rose for more interest rate cuts<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese markets outperformed much of the globe. China posted some of the strongest returns, marking three straight months of outpacing its EM peers. Easing trade tensions with the U.S., policy support for chipmakers and accelerating spending on AI drove gains amid hopes that the government's policy to combat price wars and disinflation will help the Chinese economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Information technology stocks drove quarterly outperformance. The sector was home to three top contributors, including Zhongji Innolight, electronics manufacturing company Delta Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLEGF\" title=\"Delta Electronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited\">OTCPK:DLEGF</a>) and chip designer company Montage Technology. We believe Delta rallied amid positive earnings surprises, strong performance in electric vehicles and data centers, and growth expectations around global electrification trends and AI infrastructure expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financials was an area of relative strength. Stocks we did not hold helped power gains in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning in materials hindered relative performance. Lack of exposure to many sector names that we did not own was a key driver to underperformance, along with an underweight to South Africa-based mining group Gold Fields (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFI\" title=\"Gold Fields Limited\">GFI</a>) relative to the benchmark.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zhongji Innolight. We believe a strong earnings report and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI\" title=\"C3.ai, Inc.\">AI</a>)-driven demand supported the stock. Zhongji Innolight is a key supplier of high-end optical transceivers for AI data centers and 5G networks, a focus of global AI capital spending cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Delta Electronics. Positive earnings surprises and strong performance in electric vehicles and data centers lifted shares. The company raised earnings forecasts, reflecting confidence in its growth trajectory. We believe Delta, a key supplier of AI power, is benefiting from global electrification trends and AI infrastructure expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Montage Technology. The company reported surging revenue and net profit growth, and our research indicated that it has continued to enlarge its presence in the scale-up networking market, while maintaining stable growth in its interface integrated circuit business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xiaomi. We believe the stock was weak amid competition in the smartphone space, a seasonal slowdown in the Internet of Things segment and rising costs, as higher-than-expected operating expenses weighed on earnings. Our research also indicated that a slower-than-expected new factory ramp-up drove lower volume forecasts for electric vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ICICI Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBN\" title=\"ICICI Bank Limited\">IBN</a>). The stock underperformed due to what we believed was a mix of margin pressure, rising gross nonperforming assets and concerns about consumer credit demand and asset quality. Net interest margin declined, and management warned that margins may fall further if interest rates fall. Deposit growth was also weaker than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alibaba (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) Group Holding. An underweight to the China-based e-commerce giant relative to the benchmark weighed on returns as the stock advanced during the period.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Trades</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HKXCF\" title=\"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\">OTCPK:HKXCF</a>). The securities and derivatives exchange is the key conduit of capital flows to and from mainland China. With policy support for capital markets activity and area economies driving flow activity, we believe increased initial public offering activity and the Stock Connect program reforms will likely support the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Montage Technology. The company is a fabless firm mainly engaged in designing and selling memory interface chips, with end markets focused on servers and data centers. We believe solid growth in memory interface chips and a fast ramp-up of new products have helped create a more promising growth outlook for Montage Technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China State Construction International Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCOHF\" title=\"China State Construction International Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:CCOHF</a>). We exited CSCI amid what we believed were ongoing challenges in China's construction and infrastructure space, including slower project approvals and continuing weakness in the real estate market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BYD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF\" title=\"BYD Company Limited\">OTCPK:BYDDF</a>). We exited BYD amid what we believed were weaker-than-expected earnings, slowing domestic demand and intensifying competition in China's electric vehicle market. BYD missed consensus profit estimates and cut its 2025 sales target as government pressure to end aggressive price wars, which had helped fuel BYD's rapid growth, weighed on the company.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio continues to invest in companies where we believe financials are strong and improving but share price performance does not fully reflect these factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our outlook remains constructive. In our view, emerging markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EM\" title=\"Smart Share Global Limited\">EM</a>) equities have been supported by strong company performance, stabilizing U.S. trade policy and anticipated interest rate cuts from the U.S. Fed. We believe the growth gap between EM and developed markets (DM) will remain robust, with EM economies' growth rates expected to improve in 2026, while the U.S. and some other DM are projected to weaken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM valuations, earnings growth potential provide separation. We believe EM companies typically offer more attractive valuations and the prospect of higher earnings growth than many global DM peers. Given the often strong inverse relationship between EM equities and the dollar, we think a weaker U.S. dollar could also function as a growth driver for EM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Government policy efforts a key in China. The summer tariff pause between the U.S. and China has helped improve market sentiment toward China. We think that while domestic economic growth may moderate in the short term, the Chinese government's targeted approach to increasing domestic demand will likely support profitability, while easing deflation and oversupply. We believe that if the government is successful, demand improvement could be sizable and would likely reverberate across other emerging markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM companies are central to global technology and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI\" title=\"C3.ai, Inc.\">AI</a>) supply chains. Our research has indicated that while high tariff rates may provide headwinds in markets such as India and Brazil, South Korea, China and Taiwan are among the nations that have benefited from rapidly increasing investment in AI and AI-driven sentiment, pushing equities to all-time highs in many markets. During the quarter, many of the world's largest tech firms—hyperscalers including Alphabet ((GOOG) (GOOGL)), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>)—revealed plans to increase their capital expenditures, affirming their commitment to AI-related spending despite some investor concerns that they might dial things back, especially in early 2025.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Goal and Strategy:</strong> Long-term capital growth by investing primarily in emerging market companies of all sizes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio Management Team</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Start Date</th> <th></th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>Industry</th> <th>Company</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Patricia Ribeiro</td> <td>1984</td> <td>2006</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sherwin Soo, CFA</td> <td>1995</td> <td>2011</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Top 10 Holdings (%)</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody> <tr> <td>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>)</td> <td>11.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tencent Holdings Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCTZF\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCTZF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>)</td> <td>7.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</td> <td>4.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>) Co Ltd</td> <td>3.74</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Xiaomi Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XIACF\" title=\"Xiaomi Corporation\">OTCPK:XIACF</a>)</td> <td>2.37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SK Hynix Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>)</td> <td>2.15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NetEase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTES\" title=\"NetEase, Inc.\">NTES</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NETTF\" title=\"NetEase, Inc.\">OTCPK:NETTF</a>) Inc</td> <td>2.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ICICI Bank Ltd</td> <td>2.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>HDFC Bank Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HDB\" title=\"HDFC Bank Limited\">HDB</a>)</td> <td>2.02</td> </tr> <tr> <td>China Construction Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CICHY\" title=\"China Construction Bank Corporation\">OTCPK:CICHY</a>) Corp</td> <td>2.01</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td>As of 9/30/2025<em>The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security.

Q3 2025 results gave<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> even more conviction that my investment thesis for VLTO would play out. With a robust demand outlook for the WQ segment and the product innovation strategy supporting the PIQ segment, I expect growth to eventually accelerate, and that would drive up multiples.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Q3 2025 results support the bull thesis.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VLTO delivered another solid quarter in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20283295-veralto-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025</a>, reinforcing my bullish view on this company. Total sales grew 6.9% y/y to $1.404 billion, with core sales up 5.1% (this is the fifth straight quarter of mid-single-digit growth). Both volume and pricing contributed positively for all segments. Water Quality [WQ] saw revenue up 7% y/y to $856 million and core growth of 5.3%, led by North America (6% y/y) and high-growth markets (7.1% y/y). EBIT margin for WQ expanded 150 bps y/y to 26.3%. As for Product Quality &amp; Innovation [PQI], revenue grew 6.9% y/y to $548 million (core growth was 4.6%), driven by North America (9.2%) and 330 bps of price contribution to offset tariffs. While the PQI margin dipped to 25.4%, it was mainly due to acquisitions and tariff mitigation, not structural factors. Adj. EPS grew 11% y/y to $0.99, beating the high end of guidance by $0.04, and management raised FY25 adj. EPS guidance to $3.82–$3.85 (from $3.72–$3.80). Overall, the quarter was good.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The WQ segment continues to ride powerful secular waves.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have become more confident about the WQ segment performance after looking at the developments so far. Core sales accelerated sequentially to 5.3% y/y growth, and notably, this momentum was broad-based, supported by both water treatment and water analytics. But perhaps the more important takeaway was the clearer link between VLTO growth and the global AI infrastructure investment theme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor angle I discussed earlier this year is clearly playing out, but the first distinction today is that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834673-veralto-corporation-vlto-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">management has explicitly called</a> out the opportunity tied directly to data centers (which is really driven largely by the major cloud and hyperscale players) as well as related sub-segments like power generation. As a recap, the basic idea here is that these facilities require substantial volumes of water for cooling, and this plays right up into VLTO’s strength. Operators need to rely on VLTO to help maintain uptime while at the same time reduce both water and energy consumption. You could, in fact, see VLTO’s water solution as mission critical because without it, the entire data center will not work well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have very high visibility to the demand outlook here as well, which makes the equity story even more attractive. The latest earnings from hyperscalers such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Microsoft</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Alphabet</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) show us just how massive this AI infrastructure build-out has become. Take MSFT, for instance; its commercial remaining purchase obligation [RPO] grew &gt;50% y/y to ~$400 billion, with an incremental $250 billion Azure commitment from OpenAI alone. The more impressive data point is that MSFT expects to increase AI capacity by &gt;80% in FY25 and roughly double their data center footprint within two years. This implies a significant acceleration in data center investments. A similar picture is painted by GOOGL, which saw its Google Cloud backlog grow 46% sequentially to $155 billion, which is also driven primarily by AI-related workloads. Both companies even came out explicitly saying that they will remain capacity-constrained well into next year as demand continues to outpace supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, this is not a case of whether data center investments will come through, but one that is going to happen.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PQI Is Executing Well</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As expected, the PQI segment got impacted by tariff impacts, and like I noted in my February write-up, navigating the tariff environment would be a key test for VLTO. Encouragingly, Q3’s results confirm VLTO is managing it well. Contrary to my belief that VLTO will lose pricing power, it actually managed to push pricing upwards, which contributed 330 bps to core growth. This shows that the adjustments made earlier this year have helped VLTO to fully offset tariff costs going forward. The key line item here, I think, is volume growth. VLTO actually managed to push pricing upwards with volume growing (volume up 1.3% y/y), which suggests a very healthy end-market demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A big part of this pricing power comes from VLTO’s product innovation strategy, of which the highlight of this quarter was Videojet, which saw strong adoption for the refreshed Continuous Ink Jet [CIJ] and laser printer lineup. I expect adoption to remain strong here, giving VLTO pricing power, as the new UV laser marking system is just a way better product that replaces older technologies. There are two key upgrades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it provides an alternative to thermal transfer overlay [TTO] systems (this is the widely used legacy method). The difference lies in the marking process itself. TTO uses a heated print head to press ink from a ribbon onto the film, requiring direct contact and ongoing consumable ribbons. But for VLTO's new UV laser technology, it uses precise chemical change directly on the film surface using a light beam, which creates a permanent mark without contact, heat, or consumables. The result is not only better reliability (fewer chemical reactions needed) but also lower long-term operating costs (less heat and fewer consumables used).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, and perhaps more importantly in today’s market, the UV laser helps customers transition to more sustainable flexible film packaging. With the UV laser technology, customers will produce way less ribbon waste and at the same time also be able to use thinner films (lesser materials used vs. thicker films that are needed to withstand heat from TTO technology). This effectively allows CPG companies to work towards their ESG goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, I’d say that while PQI’s margins remain temporarily affected by tariff mitigation and ongoing growth investments, the overall results were positive. As we roll into next year, PQI will face an easy comp as it continues to enjoy pricing power, supported by the new product innovation strategy.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF and balance sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also think it's worth putting attention on VLTO’s free cash flow [FCF] and balance sheet situation. In Q3, VLTO generated $258 million in FCF, which was up 20% y/y, pushing year-to-date FCF to &gt;$700 million. This is a very comforting performance because it means that VLTO can continue to invest aggressively in its R&amp;D without worrying about liquidity issues. This adds strength to the balance sheet, which existed in Q3 with ~$1.8 billion in cash and net leverage at just 0.7x. With this leverage ratio, VLTO has the choice to take on debt to ramp up investments or acquire strategically. On the latter, management did note in the call that M&amp;A remains the top capital allocation priority, and they are seeing an active pipeline of targets across both WQ and PQI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe the fundamentals remain strong, and VLTO has a strong balance sheet to support this growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With my views unchanged for VLTO’s fundamentals (which, in fact, have gotten better), I think the valuation de-rating seen so far has been unwarranted. VLTO is now trading at just 17x forward EBITDA, a discount from its average of ~19x. The market seems to be penalizing VLTO for the softer Q4 core growth guidance (low single-digit percentage), which I think is unfair given that Q4 has three fewer shipping days. Adjusting for those, growth would’ve been mid-single-digits. Also, the large data center demand opportunity has yet to be realized in VLTO’s books. As the big boys like MSFT and GOOGL ramp up spending, we should see growth acceleration for VLTO WQ’s segment. At the current 17x, I think the market is not pricing in any growth acceleration at all, and as I said before, once VLTO shows that, multiples should re-rate upwards easily. I would think a re-rate to 19x (the average) is a very possible range in the next couple of quarters.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing volatility in trade policies and tariffs are key uncertainties. While current mitigation actions (such as targeted pricing and supply chain adjustments) have worked, there is no guarantee that further policy shifts would not happen. Should they happen and the impacts be worse, VLTO will be impacted. VLTO is also investing heavily in growth initiatives, which carry some form of execution risk. Any delays or inefficiencies in these projects could temporarily weigh on margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view for VLTO remains a buy rating. The fundamentals here continue to strengthen, with visible demand drivers, solid execution, and a balance sheet that provides flexibility. I believe the current valuation at ~17x forward EBITDA is an attractive entry point, especially ahead of potential growth acceleration from AI-related infrastructure opportunities.</p>",

I had put the stock on hold, awaiting more clarity. The drop after the report is confirming that. The company is giving a lower forecast, the renewals of old on-prem contracts have been going weakly, and hence the SaaS migration is the key to getting the right execution. Investors have lowered the multiple, thus getting rid of the valuation premium. It's not that I foreshadowed it, but it was the probable result when expectations and reality met ​‍​‌‍​‍‌head-on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this, I don't want to throw the company away, because the business isn't \"broken.\" The data-first approach is working, the SaaS share is high, and FCF remains a good cushion overall. That said, I don't feel like my view on the stock has changed, and I'll explain why. True, it's become cheaper, and certainly attractive at -48% compared to the other day, but until operating leverage is clearly and consistently visible, the valuation remains fragile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the following paragraphs, I summarize the quarterly numbers, update growth and margins, and define a 12-month target with my buy zone and risk levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Varonis's <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/582009126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Varonis-Investor-Deck-3Q25-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">quarterly results</a> divided the market, because, on closer inspection, the numbers aren't all that bad. What investors and analysts (myself included) didn't like is that the company confirmed that its transformation to SaaS has entered the most difficult phase.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#What worked</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good part of the quarter is that growth hasn't stopped. As the company's presentation shows, annual recurring revenues (ARR for short) rose to $718.6 million, up 18% year over year, with SaaS now accounting for 76% of the total. This proves that the recurring subscription model is now working as it should and that old contracts installed on customer servers are quickly disappearing.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"549\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Varonis\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Varonis</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash generation capacity also remained very strong; in the first nine months, the company generated over $111 million in free cash flow, up from $88 million in the same period last year. The outlook for the future should also be positive in this regard. Considering it's undergoing a costly transformation (with heavy investments to move everything to the cloud), this is a sign of very careful financial management.

The CEO himself acknowledged that the rate of renewals won't get back to usual until the second half of 2026, therefore determining the monetizing of the SasS model will come around twelve to eighteen months minimum.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#Let's summarize</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's keep it simple and tell you what I think. Here we have a company with an interesting and solid business, the demand for data security is growing (just look around and understand the world we live in), and the financial position is strong, but the operating cycle is still in the difficult part. The stock isn't bad, as I said, but patience is needed. Those who have it can hold onto the stock or increase their exposure, taking advantage of yesterday's plunge. Those who don't have it might be better to wait a little longer. Until margins recover and operating leverage emerges, it will be difficult to see a structural rerating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Target Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To value a stock of this caliber and under these conditions, as transparently as possible, I prefer to first look at cash flow. According to the company, FCF is expected to be between $120 and $125 million for 2025, with net cash of approximately $1.1 billion and 134.8 million diluted shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Framing the issue, for a software company still in the transition phase toward the cloud, I find it appropriate to assign a range of multiples between 20x and 30x FCF (consistent with the current risk/return profile).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Below 20x, growth is priced in under pressure or a loss of momentum.</li> <li>Above 30x, full operating leverage is already assumed, which, however, is not reflected in the numbers we see today.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All things considered, with $120–$125 million in FCF and $1.1 billion in net cash, the implied equity value comes to $26–$36 per share, depending on the multiple previously applied. As always, I want to be conservative and realistic in my valuations, and I've chosen the midpoint of the guidance, choosing 28x, which gives me a 12-month fair value of $34.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock is trading at around $32 at the time of writing, so in my opinion the market is already pricing in around 29–30x [FCF], which represents an improvement in margins that hasn't yet been reflected in the financial statements. To sustainably push above $36, operating leverage would need to become visible in the next two quarters, with margins and retention clearly improving. Maybe that will be the case, but for now, no, and I don't feel like going any further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I'm maintaining my \"Hold\" rating. My view would only change if we see non-GAAP margins return to positive territory and a tangible acceleration in the SaaS mix. For that, we'll have to wait for the company's next earnings releases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's move on to the final part of the analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, the biggest risk is that Varonis continues to grow without improving margins. The transition to SaaS is almost complete, but the model hasn't yet demonstrated the operating leverage the market expects. Indeed, as management has confirmed, monetization is being pushed further and further into the future, which is very uncomfortable for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other major issue concerns the strong market competition. We're facing players like Microsoft, AWS, and Palo Alto, which are meanwhile integrating AI-based data protection and security features into their platforms. If these solutions were to consolidate, Varonis might find itself with less room to raise prices in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, what I like about the stock is that it has a solid balance sheet, with over $1 billion in cash and a recently authorized $150 million buyback. Additionally, the company has room to reduce sales costs and streamline its go-to-market process. But it takes time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What would I do now?</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The collapse isn't enough to call it a deal. Operationally, I'm not chasing a rebound and am maintaining \"Hold.\" As I said before, I'm not worried about the balance sheet, but rather the execution and even the strong competition. The product is good and is well into its cycle; the problem now is figuring out how to monetize it, and especially when. I've seen management is worried, and this keeps me firm on my June idea, which I confirm today.</p>",

While there may be some merit to that argument, I do not place much emphasis on it. The unfortunate situation in Gaza has been ongoing for a while, and most did not worry about the conflict affecting oil prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As far as Russia is concerned, it has been producing aggressively throughout the last several years to help fund its economy and its war efforts. While some might believe that a ceasefire would reduce geopolitical risk, which is true, and ought therefore to reduce oil prices, I take a different view. Reduced tensions would allow for rebuilding and more confidence throughout Europe. More confidence means more economic activity, causing more demand for fossil fuels. As we know, the hoped-for ceasefire in Ukraine has not materialized and fighting continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a few days in October, there were heightened fears of another US regional banking crisis. Fortunately, the cockroaches, a term Jamie Dimon used to describe potential hidden credit risks in the economy, never fully materialized. At least for now, this issue is not a problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US government shutdown has not been a major theme in the oil markets, though it is contributing to some uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In September, most thought that the US and China were making great strides toward a new tariff arrangement. And then in early October, China indicated that it plans to expand its export controls over its rare earths. That caused a rupture in the tariff negotiations. In the past two weeks, both sides appear to be making efforts to repair some of the damage, and the two leaders are due to meet later this week. As an indication of reduced tensions, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/china/trump-xi-to-discuss-lowering-china-tariffs-for-fentanyl-crackdown-8094fe83\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"WSJ: “Trump, Xi to Discuss Lowering China Tariffs for Fentanyl Crackdown\">features an article</a> today “Trump, Xi to Discuss Lowering China Tariffs for Fentanyl Crackdown” (subscription required) that suggest both sides are seeking a de-escalation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Should the US and China make concrete progress toward lessening of tensions and tariffs, that would increase confidence in both countries and lend more support to increased oil prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the IEA published its bearish outlook, oil prices were knocked lower. The Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9f5ed18-5ca2-4154-9982-40616121a69d\" title=\"Oil tumbles to five-month low on report of ‘large surplus’\" rel=\"nofollow\">published</a> “Oil tumbles to five-month low on report of ‘large surplus’” (subscription required), where it mentioned that prices were expected to go even lower.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The recent surplus of crude comes after China and other economies had been increasing their stockpiles, with global observed inventories at a four-year high from January to August this year, according to the IEA.</p> <p>Its estimate of an overhang is in contrast to the view of Opec, which said that “despite speculative activity in the futures market, near-term physical crude fundamentals remained broadly supportive of the market”, in a monthly report on Monday. It maintained its forecast for global oil demand in 2025 from the previous month.</p> <p>Speaking at the Energy Intelligence Forum in London, Ben Luckock, the head of oil trading at Trafigura, said he expected prices could fall below $60 a barrel before rallying.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Luckock is referring to Brent oil prices, which typically exceed WTI oil prices anywhere from $2 to $4 per barrel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/iea-forecasts-bigger-oil-surplus-with-global-inventories-soon-set-to-rise-752e585b\" title=\"WSJ: IEA Forecasts Bigger Oil Surplus, With Global Inventories Soon Set to Rise\" rel=\"nofollow\">published</a> “IEA Forecasts Bigger Oil Surplus, With Global Inventories Soon Set to Rise” (subscription required), where it mentioned a forecasted oil supply growth of three million barrels a day.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The Paris-based organization now forecasts oil-supply growth of 3 million barrels a day this year and 2.4 million the next, from earlier estimates of 2.7 million and 2.1 million barrels a day, respectively. Global demand, however, is expected to grow by 710,000 barrels a day and 699,000 barrels a day over the periods.</p> <p>“The oil market has been in surplus since the start of the year, but stock builds have so far been concentrated in crude in China and gas liquids in the U.S.,” the IEA said.</p> <p>Middle Eastern oil production surged by September as OPEC+ countries ramped up output. However, seasonal demand remained subdued, leaving the region with a larger surplus of crude oil available for export. This, combined with robust oil flows from the Americas, resulted in a massive buildup of oil in floating storage or in transit - the largest increase since the Covid-19 era.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The topic of oil in floating storage or oil-on-water has been debated endlessly on X. Some point to it as an indication of a large, impending glut of oil, while others believe it has been overplayed in the media and by some traders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is an X post by Javier Blas of Bloomberg showing the buildup of crude-in-transit or oil-on-water:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing buildup of crude-in-transit or oil-on-water\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"\" width=\"569\" height=\"823\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eric Nuttall shares his thoughts toward the latter part of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqtkkJP9A70\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent YouTube video</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After listening to Dr. Anas Alhajji on <a href=\"https://x.com/i/spaces/1ZkKzZWBaBXKv\" title=\"Dr. Anas Alhajji X Space: Oil Market Update: Debunking the Hype of Oil on Water \" rel=\"nofollow\">his X Space</a>, I became convinced that the oil-on-water issue is overblown.

The questions are not whether there are builds but whether the builds are larger than normal and whether global inventories are larger than normal. If the answer to both questions is that builds are seasonally normal or smaller, then prices should remain relatively stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering all this information, I do not see much upside to WTI oil prices. I strongly doubt it gets past $65 on the upside. And although it recently was in the mid-$50s, I tend to think that was during a wave of extreme pessimism when several stories were conspiring against oil. My expectation is that WTI oil prices will spend most of November in the high $50 to low $60s. As stated at the outset, my expected range is between $55 and $65 for November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://speciousargument.com/blog/2025/10/29/oil-update-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

If the interest rates were to return to artificially low levels (i.e., ZIRP), higher equity multiples would be justifiable. However, I work with the assumption that interest rates will eventually track the long-term average of ~5%.

(NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\" class=\"ticker-link\">DOCU</a>) is an American Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company that provides electronic signature and digital transaction management services. It operates under a cloud-based platform named DocuSign Agreement Cloud that enables workflow automation and efficient management of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> electronically signed agreements. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has been a significant benchmark underperformer over the past years. While the stock remained almost flat over the past 12 months with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\">1.6%</a> increase, it is down roughly 68% over the past 5 years. This highlights weak performance, yet I argue the company may be well-positioned to rebound from these levels. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DOCU trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of about 19</a>, implying approximately a 25% discount to the sector median of nearly 26 earnings multiples. In the meantime, the software company operates at substantially above-market margins, which deserve a premium valuation. The company offers AI-tailored solutions to streamline workflows and reduce workloads, which I don't think the market has priced in, and that could fuel a bullish narrative in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I rate DocuSign a Buy with an $81 price target over the next 12 months. I believe the company faces tailwinds that outweigh risks and concerns. This suggests about 14% upside potential and broader market outperformance. I think the stock price may mirror bottom-line growth, which is supported by impressive operating margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FQ2 2026: The 13th Consecutive Double-Beat Quarter. Can The Trend Continue?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On September 4, the company reported <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Financial-Results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FQ2 2026</a> results. This was the 13th consecutive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">double-beat</a> quarter, signaling robust and consistent performance. This sort of stable business activity argues for a premium valuation. The market reacted to the results with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/historical-price-quotes\">a 5% increase</a> in the stock price over the following trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign posted roughly $801 million in revenue, representing 9% growth on a year-over-year basis, and $20 million higher than what the market had anticipated. The bottom line arrived at $0.92 in diluted EPS. Although this was a drop from $0.97 in the same quarter last year, the bottom-line result came in $0.07 above the analysts' estimates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"953\" data-height=\"533\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DOCU: FQ2 2026 Revenue\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DOCU: FQ2 2026 Revenue <span>(DocuSign Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's digital revenue, which is mainly derived from subscription fees, drove growth and outpaced the overall business. Although their DocuSign is a market leader in the e-signature landscape, which fuels a bullish narrative, its IAM (Intelligent Agreement Management) services may unlock a new growth cycle for the company. It assists clients throughout the entire agreement process, helping automate workflows, manage renewals and obligations, and gain insights from reporting. There are more than <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/408980645/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Q2-26-Docusign-Quarterly-Earnings-Deck.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10,000 organizations</a> that DOCU assists with its IAM solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819777-docusign-inc-docu-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\"> earnings call</a>, management highlighted a 9% customer growth, ending the quarter with more than 1.7 million customers. I also think that this result correlated with the SaaS company's focus on the international expansion, that I believe may remain their core focus in the following quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted that the company experienced 13% international growth, which significantly contributes to the business's bullish outlook. To elaborate, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819777-docusign-inc-docu-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Asia-Pacific Region</a> was the fastest-growing across all markets. I think that this suggests a demographic tailwind for the company, that could significantly contribute to its growth over the following years. This region is densely populated, with a high percentage of population living in the region, with both Japan and Australia highlighted as the direct focus countries. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following this, the company appears more diversified, which makes it a more compelling play and underscores strong demand for its services. In addition, international revenue now accounts for 29% of total revenue. I believe that if management's focus remains on international markets, DOCU could be able to maintain its dominant stance in the operating landscape.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"950\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DOCU: FQ2 2026 International Growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DOCU: FQ2 2026 International Growth <span>(DocuSign Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, in the <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/408980645/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Q2-26-Docusign-Quarterly-Earnings-Deck.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">presentation</a>, the company noted that it maintained healthy operating efficiency, underscoring 83.8% subscription gross margins and 82% total gross margins. These are exceptional results that deserve a premium valuation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted a comprehensive network of partners, with well-known companies, including Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, Salesforce, and others. Independent software vendors, system integrators, and resellers use DOCU's tools to enhance their workflows. This supports my thesis that DOCU's services are high-quality, appear widely used, and I believe the trend is likely to continue. For instance, on <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Recognized-in-Salesforce-2025-Partner-Innovation-Awards/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">October 13</a>, Salesforce recognized DOCU in the Partner Innovation Awards, highlighting its IAM solution designed for sales, streamlining agreement flow, surfacing agentic actions AI-powered insights. I also think that such recognition supports the bullish trend and future revenue growth, implying a high satisfaction leading to a potentially sticky customer base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The digital signature market size was valued at about <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/digital-signature-market-100356\" rel=\"nofollow\">$10 billion</a> in 2025, and is anticipated to grow tenfold over the following 7 years. This would reflect a 40.1% CAGR and validate my bullish narrative.

DOCU is expected to deliver <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">FQ3 2026 results</a> on November 4 after market close. Wall Street anticipates a continuation of both top and bottom line growth. The market forecasts $807 million in revenue, indicating 7% growth versus the same quarter last year, and $0.91 in diluted EPS, representing about a 2% increase on a year-over-year basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its recent performance, international growth, and strong demand for digital agreement management services, I believe the company may achieve the results. Furthermore, on <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/DOCUSIGN-NAMED-TO-FORTUNES-2025-FUTURE-50-LIST-OF-COMPANIES-WITH-THE-GREATEST-LONG-TERM-GROWTH-PROSPECTS/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">September 15</a>, the company announced it made a Fortune editor list and was included among 50 other companies that are tied to the greatest long-term growth prospects. Such reports are uplifting, but investors should monitor whether management can maintain excellent execution. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the company has substantial tailwinds that could drive further growth. If DOCU can experience a continuation in both top and bottom line growth, I believe the market may reprice the stock at a higher premium multiple. This could drive the stock price and mirror EPS expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign Appears To Be Trading At A Discount, Although It Offers Phenomenal Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The SaaS company currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of 19.22</a>, which appears to be 35% discounted to the sector median of 25.46. This also implies that the company trades at about 24% below the average company in the S&amp;P500 at<a href=\"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a 23.62</a> earnings multiple.

The forward PEG (non-GAAP) of 1.56 supports a bullish outlook for the company and argues that it appears undervalued. This underscores a 15% discount to peers at 1.83. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 4.22 and 4.44, respectively, cloud a positive outlook and imply that the company may be fairly priced. It also presents a possibility that the market has already partially priced in future growth, which may limit the upside in the future. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"878\" data-height=\"221\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DOCU: Capital Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"161\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DOCU: Capital Structure <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, the company seems to be a low-leveraged business, as it only has about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/capital-structure\">$127 million</a> in total obligations. DOCU has approximately $844 million in cash and could pay its debt with ease. This also leaves financial flexibility for management to use debt-related instruments, if needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company grew its revenue by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/growth\">8.29%</a> over the past 12 months, reflecting a roughly 15% higher growth rate than the sector median of 7.22%, and supporting premium valuation. The forward revenue growth rate of 7.34% suggests that the trend is likely to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom-line surged by 13% on a TTM basis from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">$3.14 in FQ3 2024 to FQ3 2025</a> to $3.58 in the past 12 months.

The net income margin (TTM) of 9.08% highlights 2x outperformance compared to the industry's average of 4.49%. This presents a disconnect in valuation. DOCU trades at a discount to peers, although it is tied to outstanding operating margins. I believe the gap may narrow, which supports a bullish stance for the SaaS company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market forecasts a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings/estimates\">$3.68 in diluted EPS</a> for FY2025. This would reflect about 4% growth on a year-over-year basis. Wall Street believes the company may post $4.03 in FY2026, reflecting roughly double-digit bottom-line expansion. Given its strong demand, significant market dominance, tailwinds tied to the digital signature market growth, and outstanding operating margins, I believe the software company could achieve these results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its AI-tailored solutions, I believe the market may reprice DOCU at a higher multiple. If we apply a 20x forward P/E, which could still reflect more than a 20% discount to both peers and the benchmark, at an FY2026 EPS of $4.03, we arrive at my price target of $81. I think that the market overlooks DOCU, as it remains a high-quality, highly profitable company. Time will tell, but it may appear a compelling opportunity for investors seeking SaaS exposure at an appealing valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Main Risks And Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks and concerns tied to DocuSign that could cloud a bullish outlook and impact the stock price performance in the short term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's revenue decelerated from pandemic heights, and I think that is the reason behind a significant sell-off and suppressed valuations. The market overlooks the company and its high-demand business. It may take time for investors to rethink their thesis about the stock, which could cap upside in the near term. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There appears to be fierce competition in the landscape, which raises concerns about the company's future outlook. DocuSign competes with Adobe, Dropbox, Salesforce, and other well-known companies in the field. This may pressure its substantial margins, which could stress the stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe there are risks tied to execution and AI-tailored solutions. So far, DOCU has experienced a limited product diversification, which I think may cap the upside in the near term. If the company fails to broaden its products and services, or AI-tailored solutions do not translate into meaningful top and bottom line growth, investors may not be willing to pay a premium for the software company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, if none of the above were to materialize, I believe the company appears to be well-positioned for continued demand and high SaaS margins. This could drive bottom-line growth, and the stock price may follow the EPS performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: DocuSign Is A Buy, As It Remains A Premium Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that DocuSign remains a high-quality company. The risks and concerns tied to its business appear overblown. DOCU is a low-leveraged company, operating at outstanding margins, which are fueling a bullish narrative and bottom-line growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One could argue that the digital e-signature market may appear mature, which could cloud the upside in the following years, but DOCU continues to innovate, and AI-tailored solutions may unlock a new growth cycle. Nevertheless, the research I shared anticipates a continued market growth, and I believe DOCU could benefit from it.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why I rate DocuSign a Buy with a $81 price target over the next year. It presents a 14% opportunity, highlighting broader market outperformance. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">22 Wall Street</a> analysts forecast a $94 price target, presenting a 36% upside possibility. I favor a more conservative approach, but if tailwinds materialize, this is definitely a possibility.</p>",

My initial <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724107-the-battle-of-two-goliaths-ares-capital-vs-fs-kkr-update\">thesis</a> was based on strong fundamentals, unique loan origination capabilities and diversified investment platform, which positioned ARCC<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> well for capturing the increasing demand for private credit in a high-spread and low-risk manner.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the total return figure was very attractive and exceeded that of BDC index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>), I decided to liquidate my position before <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/851/115851/original.pdf\">Q3 report</a>. In fact, I went even as far as plotting a case for a likely dividend reduction, hence the title of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821765-dare-i-say-it-arcc-is-about-to-cut-its-dividend\">article</a>: <em>Dare I Say It, Ares Capital Is About To Cut Its Dividend</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main reason for this move was the combination of declining base rates, unfavorable exposure to spread compression dynamics, rising risks on the non-accrual front (due to large non first-lien position) and relatively thin base dividend coverage level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, the fact that Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL\" title=\"Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund\">MSDL</a>) and Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBDC\" title=\"Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc.\">KBDC</a>) - comparable high-quality BDCs - were trading at almost 20% cheaper P/NAV metrics made my decision much easier. Just for the context, this is why I consider MSDL and KBDC directly comparable to ARCC:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>All three are externally managed BDCs (i.e., no reason for having premium for more cost effective internal management component).</li> <li>All three have investment grade balance sheets.</li> <li>None of them focuses on venture capital or lower middle market lending.</li> <li>The net debt to equity ratios are rather similar within 1.0x to 1.25x range (usual BDC target capital structure levels); and, actually, KBDC has 0.90x, which provides an advantage in terms of funding growth via additional debt issuances.</li> <li>Non-accruals on a FV basis are below 2.0% for all three names.</li> <li>The portfolio company interest rate coverage ratios are at 2.0x or above (MSDL and KBDC portfolio companies have even higher than it is for ARCC - at 2.0x).</li> <li>The base dividend coverage levels are almost identical - for ARCC it is 102% and for both MSDL and KBDC at 100%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the rationale for exiting ARCC is similar to what I have outlined in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827574-dare-i-say-it-bxsl-is-the-most-overpriced-quality-bdc-rating-downgrade\">piece</a> on Blackstone Secured Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) - i.e., too high price relative to underlying fundamentals and comparable peer valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, my thesis has been playing out nicely actually:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as I have stated in the title of this article, the Q3, 2025 report for ARCC was exceptionally strong, beating the consensus expectations and, to be honest, surprising me as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let's now together dissect the key data points and determine whether ARCC has really become more attractive after the publication of Q3 financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, ARCC bulls could not have asked for better results than what were delivered now. It seems that ARCC was firing on all cylinders in Q3 period, checking the necessary boxes for incremental value creation and stability across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will share the main points that we should appreciate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The NAV per share increased from $19.90 in Q2 to $20.01 now with the main driver being the second highest net realized gain amount that has been achieved since ARCC's inception.</li> <li>The weighted average spread over SOFR for the newly funded loan investments came in at 580 basis points, which implies a spread widening by about 20 basis points compared to the previous quarter.</li> <li>Non-accruals decreased from very low base of 1.2% in Q2 to 1.0% now.</li> <li>The underlying portfolio company credit profile improved as the TTM EBITDA continued to trend upwards.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, the management in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834260-ares-capital-arcc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> made it very clear to the audience that it is strongly committed to maintaining the existing dividend distribution amounts unchanged:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As a starting point, in the third quarter of 2025, our core earnings continued to exceed our dividend. Second, during the last period of rising short-term interest rates in 2022 to '23, we intentionally set our dividend at a level equivalent to a 9% to 10% ROE, which is a level we have historically achieved through different interest rate cycles over the last 20 years. We set the dividend at this level because we believe we can sustain this level of profitability through market cycles. The third point worth highlighting on this topic is what we view as our unique financial position with multiple levers to expand earnings or offset headwinds solely from falling market rates.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, I know that many BDC investors like to pay attention to the undistributed spillover income, which in this case stands at $1.26 per share, representing more than 2 quarters of ARCC full dividend payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hearing all of this, you might wonder how in the world one could be bearish on ARCC when basically all of the key fundamentals remain robust and/or are improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will explain. There are some important details that are not so obvious. But before doing that, I would like to once again emphasize that I am not recommending shorting ARCC. Instead, my overall motivation to avoid ARCC is primarily linked to the availability of more compelling BDC risk-adjusted return alternatives in the market, such as the aforementioned KBDC and MSDL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I have two conceptual items here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the net investment income per share continued to decline, landing at $0.48 per share as of Q3, 2025. For me this was not a surprise because it is just inevitable that BDC portfolio yields will be going down in a lower base rate environment. So far, we have had only one 25 bps cut (and a second one right while I am writing this article), which has, by the way, only partially percolated through ARCC's books (it takes time). The portfolio-wide yield for ARCC has declined from 10.9% in Q2 to 10.6% now in Q3. Given that the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus estimate</a> on the near-term base rate cuts indicate a total of 75 bps reduction (at least), there is still a long way to go for ARCC to reach equilibrium portfolio yield. And here we have to understand that it is per definition that ARCC's NII per share generation will get negatively impacted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to introduce more details here:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>As per the most recent <a href=\"https://ir.arescapitalcorp.com/sec-filings\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-Q filing</a>, we can see that each 25 bps of a cut would translate to about $28 million of a drop in the net income or roughly 2% of the total ARCC's income result.</li> <li>If we factor in the already made cuts this year and additional 50 bps over the course of Q4, 2025 - Q1, 2026, the combined negative impact on the income generation would be between 6% and 8% as we have to remember that the first base rate cut that occurred earlier this year has not fully percolated through the system (e.g., private credit loans usually come with 3-month SOFR reset periods).</li> <li>On top of this, we have to add a headwind from the inflated non-accrual side, which as I will discuss below is currently below the <a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/ebe3744a-6542-4474-a326-25ea40cf93b6/assets/ARCC_Q2-25_Investor_Presentation_vF.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">historical average</a>. I think that assuming a convergence to the mean (i.e., an uptick of ~1.2% in non-accrual on a FV basis). It really depends on the specific case that goes to non-accrual, but a good rule of the thumb would be a synchronized NII per share drop.</li> <li>Finally, I have to mention the $2.15 billion of fixed rate notes that are currently outstanding with maturity dates kicking in on January, 2026 ($1.15 billion) and July, 2026 ($1 billion). Given the cost of debt that ARCC can achieve in the markets (<a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">low 5%</a>), there is about 2.5% (on a weighted average basis) of a drag from potential refinancings. On an annualized basis this implies ~$50 million of an interest expense headwind - i.e., ~1.75% of a drop in net income.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, by summing all of the variables together, we arrive at 8% to 10% of a near-term income reduction (by near-term I mean next 12 month period).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, considering that the quarterly base dividend is at $0.48 per share, it means that currently base dividend coverage is 100%. Namely, there is no margin of safety left for ARCC to cover the dividend with NII.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, while I fully appreciate ARCC's ability to underwrite investment at higher than average spreads that have lower than average risk, I just think that it would be only prudent that we factor in some kind of normalization (i.e., a scenario in which not everything works out perfectly as in this quarter).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, speaking of non-accruals, the current level of 1.0% (on FV basis) is below ARCC's historical average of around 2.2%. Sooner or later, there will be an upswing here, especially if we take into account the prevailing macro backdrop, which seems increasingly more uncertain/risky.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also hard to imagine how ARCC could keep recognizing almost record beating net realized gains. The only reason why in Q3 ARCC was able to hit the significant figure was the sale of Potomac Energy Center, which was previously underperforming investment, placed on a non-accrual. Potomac resulted resulted in $262 million of net realized gain. For the context, over the past four quarters (excluding Q3, 2025), the average net realized gain position was actually negative $7.25 million. Plus, it happens very rarely that an underperforming asset gets restructured and monetized at gain (not loss) - i.e., we can consider it a one-off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I have to say that the earnings quality is not trending in the right direction. As of Q3, 2025, PIK consumed ~7.5% of the total income, marking an increase of around 12% on a year-over-year basis (similar dynamic if we compare to the previous quarter). From this we can extract two takeaways:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>On a cash-basis, the current dividend is undercovered.</li> <li>It seems that the spread widening for new deals was to a some extent enabled by a change in underwriting standards (as evidenced by higher share of PIK income component in Q3 than in the previous quarter, and management's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834260-ares-capital-arcc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">commentary</a> on going into the LMM segment to search for higher spreads), which is, obviously, the right thing to do in order to combat the forthcoming pressures form lower base rates, but a risky game to play in the long-term.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC is certainly a high-quality BDC and the Q3 data clearly support it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, in investing it is not only about value, but also about price you pay for it. While there is certainly a valid case for assuming premium pricing for ARCC, I still just don't see a justified ground for a) ~18% premium to <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">sector median</a> and b) similar gap from the likes of KBDC and MSDL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to ARCC's total return performance for the next 12-month period, my assumption would be that there will be a NAV decline, which should motivate the market to either reprice the stock or at least price ARCC in a more negative fashion than, say, KBDC and MSDL (i.e., comparable BDCs with significant discounts). At the same time, I do not think that the the NAV drop would be as deep as we could imply from my aforementioned 8% to 10% income decline (even though there is no surplus after dividend distributions). We have to remember that ARCC has the ability to issue new equity at NAV and that it has a spare financial capacity to accommodate organic portfolio growth, which is inherently accretive provided that there are no non-accruals offsetting that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the dividend, in my humble opinion, ARCC's NII per share will continue to go down due to systematic headwinds - mostly lower base rates and continued spread compression. Again, I do not think that in the next 12-month period we will see 8% to 10% of a decline in the NII per share (as the pure math would suggest) and thus deeply under covered dividend because of the same exact reasons that I provided on the NAV component. Namely, ARCC has the ability to expand portfolio in an accretive manner and, on top of that, it has a notable undistributed spillover, which could be used for a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the only scenario under which I could see ARCC cutting its dividend in the next 12-month period is if the pace and magnitude of base rate cuts accelerate (think of new Fed chair being a clear monetary dove) and there are new material non-accruals emerging (think of ARCC's PIK share and general weakness in the economy), which send the stock price below NAV and make the shortfall in the dividend coverage even deeper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I think that ARCC is a hold. It is not a sell due to relatively balanced P/NAV (1.02x) and the potential that lies in the spare financial capacity that could come in handy for offsetting the pressures from lower base rates and new non-accruals, where the latter aspect has been historically well-managed by ARCC.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I do not think that ARCC is a buy either. Putting all of the aforementioned pieces together, I simply do not see how ARCC could deliver positive growth that would justify experiencing material NAV growth and thus share price increase. The decision to not invest in ARCC is for sure made easier by the fact that relatively comparable BDCs such as MSDL and KBDC trade at rather steep discount to ARCC (18% in KBDC's case and 19% in MSDL's case) - i.e., in a nutshell, ARCC's strengths are not sufficient to fully justify such a gap in the valuations.</p>",
