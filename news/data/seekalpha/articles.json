I had a HOLD rating on the name.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the article was published, the stock hit my then price target of $542 before tumbling, registering an overall decline of 1.30%, compared with a gain of 8.21% for the S&amp;P 500 during the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT announced its Q1 results yesterday and despite a strong quarter, the stock still slipped. In this article, I analyse the Q1 numbers and the overall report in detail to identify what factors could have led to the post-earnings selloff. Moreover, MSFT went into the earnings release with the stock near all-time highs. Therefore, I also analyse the company’s valuation using a quantitative model to see if it was a factor behind the selloff.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Snapshot of Q1 Earnings Report </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT started the new fiscal year strongly, comfortably beating both the top- and bottom-line estimates. More specifically, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285087-microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-drives-first-quarter-results\">Q1 revenues came in at $77.67 billion</a>, up 17% y/y on a constant currency basis and beating analyst estimates by $2.28 billion. Diluted EPS came in at $4.13, up 21% y/y on a constant currency basis, and comfortably beating analyst estimates by $0.47. Operating margins were strong, coming in at 49%, which translates to an expansion of 200 bps (or 2%) y/y and an expansion of 410 bps (or 4.1%) sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance from the company was also strong, with Q2 revenues expected to be in the range between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion and operating margins expected to be flat on a y/y basis and down sequentially, <em>“<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">aligned with historic seasonality</a>.” </em>Capital expenditures, a metric that investors keenly watch out for, when it comes to companies such as MSFT, are now projected to not only grow sequentially but also are expected to have a higher growth rate in FY26 relative to FY25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Azure’s Strength &amp; Massive Bookings Jump Justifies Further Capex Spend</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT’s stock, at the time of writing, is down 2.2%, and it is hard for me to identify the precise catalyst behind the sell-off. It could be that the stock was at an all-time high going into the earnings, or it could be because of the increasing capex spending that the company announced at the time of reporting Q2 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it’s the latter that’s driving the sell-off, then the reaction, in my view, is certainly overdone. This is because if one looks at the overall performance of the company as well as the underlying demand that continues to outpace supply, then I don’t see any option in front of the company other than to spend more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take Azure, for instance. The segment came into the quarter with a lot of momentum and has exited the quarter with even more momentum, as it delivered a 40% y/y growth. And while on a sequential basis, the growth has only marginally ticked up from 39%, this time last year, Azure’s revenue growth stood at 33%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the demand for Azure continues to remain strong, as evidenced by a massive jump in the commercial bookings, which increased 111% in constant currency in Q1. The growth does not account for the additional $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI that was announced as part of the ChatGPT-parent’s restructuring plans, which suggests that the growth is likely to continue. Furthermore, as further evidence of how substantial the demand for Azure is, MSFT announced that its commercial remaining performance obligations reached $392 billion, which translates to a growth of 51% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1447\" data-height=\"736\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart showing the y/y revenue growth of MSFT's Commercial RPOs\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT Press Releases</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As evidenced by the above chart, this is the highest RPO growth in the last five quarters and given that the growth stood at 21% this time last year, it reflects the significant contribution that AI has played both with respect to Azure and with respect to Microsoft 365. What is even more impressive, to me, is that the weighted average duration has remained stable, despite the huge growth, at 2 years. It was also notable that management, during the earnings call, mentioned that there was sufficient breadth in the demand (numerous products, customers of all sizes) since this mitigates some of the concentration risk that the company has, with OpenAI as one of its largest customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the rapid growth seen in bookings and given that the company is generating a substantial ROI on its capex, I don’t see any reason for the company to not spend more on capital expenditures and mitigate the capacity constraints. The company has been spending while maintaining strong margins and strong growth, and with such high demand, I don’t think this time’s going to be any different. This is primarily why I believe that the negative stock reaction, post earnings release, is overdone if capex spend is the catalyst.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not to say that it was a perfect quarter from MSFT. For instance, MSFT reported a $3.1 billion loss this quarter compared to a $523 million loss during the same period last year. This is a substantial amount, and when asked about it during the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood confirmed that it was indeed the case, which is a substantial figure in my opinion. Ms. Hood also highlighted in her prepared remarks that going forward, outlook for other income and expense will exclude “<em>any impact from our investments in OpenAI,”</em> due to the “<em>ongoing nature of our partnership resulting in increased volatility.”</em> This is not exactly reassuring to investors, at least in near-to-medium term, especially with MSFT boosting their capex spending. This could be one of the reasons why the stock is down post-earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Azure’s growth in Q2 is projected to slide down to 37% due to capacity constraints, which could have also triggered a knee-jerk reaction. Finally, while the company’s search business has shown accelerated growth in recent quarters, the growth rate may be stalling, or even declining, as shown below. While search is a small part of the company’s business, MSFT’s AI moves were expected to keep the segment’s growth momentum going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart showing the y/y growth in MSFT's Search &amp; News Business\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT Q1FY26 Earnings Call Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, it was a strong quarter from MSFT. The announcement of an increase in capex spending in FY26 seems to have not gone down well with the market. However, given that the company’s core segments that rely on these investments are generating substantial growth, and with demand continuing to outpace supply, I don’t see a reason why the company should slow down its spending. Moreover, it has the cash to spend as well as return excess capital to shareholders, so I don’t see a problem in this move by MSFT.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Forward P/E Multiple Approach</p></td> <td> </td> </tr></thead> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>Price Target</p></td> <td><p>$558.00</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Projected Forward P/E Multiple</p></td> <td><p>34.85x</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Projected EPS in the next twelve months</p></td> <td><p>$16.01</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sources: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha</a> and Author’s Chosen Model (MS-ARIMA)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I deployed a Markov-Switching Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (MS-ARIMA) model to forecast MSFT’s EPS for the rest of FY26. MS-ARIMA is a regime-switching time-series model that addresses structural breaks, unlike traditional ARIMA models. MSFT is a company that has regularly gone through regime changes, with the AI revolution being the latest switch and therefore, MS-ARIMA is an appropriate model to predict MSFT’s future EPS. More information on the model can be found <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1912559\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data on MSFT’s EPS was obtained from <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Financial Modelling Prep</a>. EPS for the last twelve quarters were selected to ensure that there was a fine balance between recency and stability. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions were then deployed on the 12-quarter window. The model was validated through out-of-sample testing on the last three quarters. The out-of-sample testing resulted in the following model metrics:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Metric</p></td> <td><p>MS-ARIMA</p></td> <td><p>Notes</p></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><p>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</p></td> <td><p>0.252</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</p></td> <td><p>0.286</p></td> <td><p>Values close to MAE suggest that there are no extreme outliers in both models.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)</p></td> <td><p>6.68%</p></td> <td><p>MAPE values under 10% shows that the model is very good for forecasting.

According to Seeking Alpha, MSFT currently trades at a forward P/E 34.85x. At this multiple and with a projected FY26 of $16.01, my price target for MSFT is $558, which represents about 6% upside from current levels. The limited upside is unsurprising, given that the stock was trading at all-time highs prior to earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a momentum perspective, MSFT’s momentum has weakened in the last three months, as evidenced by the C+ grade on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/momentum/performance\">Seeking Alpha’s momentum scale</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking these together, the current levels are not attractive to initiate a position based on my analysis. As such, I am maintaining my HOLD rating. Having said that, any major pullback in the name warrants a buying opportunity in my view. Finally, I don’t see any reason for existing investors to exit their positions at current levels given the strong tailwinds that the company has.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT had a strong start to the year, with a beat on both the top- and bottom-lines. The company further justified its massive capex spending, as evidenced by the strong growth seen in Azure as well as the exponential growth seen in its commercial bookings. Operating margins were also very strong.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Post the earnings release, despite delivering a strong quarter, the stock fell, which I believe could be either due to the significant jump in OpenAI-related losses, or the projected deceleration in Azure in Q2 due to capacity constraints. An alternative to these two causes would be valuation, which my analysis suggests is the case. MSFT went into the earnings near all-time highs, so any negative news was bound to get punished. While my rating on the stock is HOLD, it’s on a pure valuation basis and not due to the fundamentals of the business. Any major pullback would be a buying opportunity in my view. Given the negative sentiment I am currently seeing in the market because of the irrational fear for capex spending, I believe such opportunities should be around the corner.</p>",

The European Central Bank calls this ‘the good<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> place’ that it's currently in, illustrating that boring times are the best times for central bankers. It made yesterday’s decision to hold rates quite straightforward, and today’s numbers emphasise that this was probably the right call. Eurozone inflation has moved within 0.2ppt of the 2% target since March, and we don’t expect it to deviate much for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, at the ECB press conference yesterday, President Christine Lagarde emphasised the concern around services inflation being persistently too high to balance out downside risks to inflation. Today’s data actually showed a further acceleration in services inflation, from 3.2 to 3.4%. The focus has been a bit more on downside risks to the inflation outlook in recent weeks, which could well push the inflation outlook lower. Today’s data stresses that the risks to the outlook do remain quite balanced, though, and resulted in a still-elevated core inflation rate at 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation is measured on a year-on-year basis, but the shorter-term developments do show a slight pickup of momentum in core inflation on the back of services prices. The three-month rate of core inflation is currently increasing to an annualised 2.7% rate. Then again, selling price expectations for services have eased further, which is a decent predictor of future price developments. For the months ahead, we do expect a further easing of the inflation rate, but not much below the 2% mark.

Steel has always been the centre of gravity for vanadium. But for the first time, that balance is beginning to shift...As long-duration battery technology gains ground, vanadium is increasingly being pulled into the energy transition, particularly through vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which use the metal as their key electrolyte. VRFBs are not new, but they are now entering a more serious growth phase. <strong>Installed capacity is expected to rise ten-fold by 2030, moving from 4 GWh today to around 40 GWh, with potential annual deployments of up to 50 GWh.</strong> As this happens, the amount of vanadium directed to battery storage could climb from around 5% of total supply to nearly 27% over the next five years. </p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: Bold emphasis by the author.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanadium miner news</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Vanadium producers</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>G</strong><strong>lencore [LSX:GLEN] [HK:805] (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLCNF\">OTCPK:GLCNF</a>)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glencore is a large vanadium producer, but vanadium production represents only a small portion of their revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 17 Mining Weekly <a href=\"https://www.miningweekly.com/article/community-unrest-erupts-at-glencores-rhovan-mine-after-expiry-of-solar-project-contracts-2025-10-17\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Community unrest erupts at Glencore’s Rhovan mine after expiry of solar project contracts...Rhovan, a vanadium mining and processing facility managed by Glencore Ferroalloys, began construction of the solar plant in 2024 as part of its efforts to support sustainable energy use...Now, after being notified that their contracts will not be renewed, the affected employees have expressed dissatisfaction and initiated a labour dispute, demanding continued employment.

As some might remember, I invested in the stock between 2020 and 2024. At first, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528578-stellantis-undervaluation-is-harder-and-harder-to-justify\">I thought the stock was deeply undervalued,</a> and I indeed saw my gains double. But <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4652229-stellantis-was-about-to-sell-but-didnt\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was slow to realize</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> how Stellantis' success hinged on supply chain bottlenecks. Once these were eased, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781030-stellantis-q1-shipments-and-revenues-suggest-more-pain-is-coming-downgrade-hold\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">the company wasn't able to accept a volume over value</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> strategy and kept focusing on margins. The result was a bloodbath, especially in the U.S., where </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">GM</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">'s strategy proved</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/luca-socci/analysis?ticker=GM\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> more resilient</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> amid different market conditions and is now paying off as General Motors is not offering big discounts as most of its peers because it has well-positioned its models in the right price tiers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, I exited the stock more or less flat, with only the hefty dividends received as the true gains (a 25% yield, more or less). This taught me a lesson: the investment in Stellantis was reasonable, but it had to be timed better. This made me understand that Stellantis wasn't the best fit for my portfolio, since I try to hold predictable companies. I thus reinvested the capital into better plays, such as Prysmian (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRYMF\" title=\"Prysmian S.p.A.\">OTCPK:PRYMF</a>) and Ferrari (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RACE\" title=\"Ferrari N.V.\">RACE</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, last week we saw both GM and Ford (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>) reporting strong results; the market reacted and sent both <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830740-earnings-preview-who-will-do-better-between-ford-and-gm-my-money-is-on-gm\">stocks up double-digits</a>. We heard about recovering industry volumes and indeed some expectations about Stellantis mounted as we waited for the company to publish its sales release (Stellantis is headquartered in the Netherlands and, therefore, issues its results semiannually, reporting only its sales in Q1 and Q3 of each fiscal year). But as soon as Stellantis reported its Q3 sales, the stock slumped and went down 9%. What is going on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First of all, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285625-stellantis-reports-13-percent-year-over-year-increase-in-q3-2025-shipments-and-net-revenues#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Stellantis reported a 13% YoY increase</a> both in shipments (1.3M) and revenues (EUR 37.2B). This ends the brutal streak of 7 consecutive quarters of sequential declines. Moreover, Stellantis reported that its market share in the U.S. grew by around 40 bps, which is another positive signal. A couple of years ago, Stellantis held a market share above 10%. Right now, it is down to 7.4%. Since North America is Stellantis' most profitable market, it is undoubtedly good news that the company was finally able to gain a bit of market share. This happened thanks to the strong sales of the new Jeep and Ram models, with Q4 expected to perform even better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we look at the net revenues and shipments breakdown by region, we see that North America's deliveries increased by 35% to 403k units, and net revenues were up 29% to EUR 16B. Europe saw its shipments increase by 8% to 534k units, with revenues increasing 4% to EUR 13B. South America, which has historically been a very successful end market for Stellantis, reported a 3% decline in shipments to 252k units, with revenues down even more (-5%) to EUR 4 B. However, the Middle East and Africa continued performing well, with shipments up 21% YoY to 94k and net revenues up by 9% to EUR 2.1B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1020\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"STLA Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"294\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>STLA Q3 Sales Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835433-stellantis-n-v-stla-q3-2025-sales-call-transcript\">sales call, </a>the new CEO, Antonio Filosa, explained that Europe didn't perform as well as expected, with a market share loss of 70 bps. In fact, the French and Italian markets were softer than previously anticipated, and the LCV business also lost some traction. As a reminder, LCVs represent Stellantis' most profitable segment and generate around a third of total revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the question remains. Why did Stellantis lose a tenth of its market cap after this sales release?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, the main reason comes from a contextual announcement that Stellantis made, stating that it has committed to its largest single investment program ever, which will make it deploy $13B in the U.S. over the next 4 years. By doing so, Stellantis aims to produce around 50% of its U.S. sales directly in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is this so concerning? Well, first and foremost, until two years ago, Stellantis was swimming in cash and had around EUR 45B parked in cash, making it one of the few automakers with a positive net cash position, even when including financial debt. The last year of Carlos Tavares' tenure brought along the surprise no one expected. A month or so after having reassured investors that the company would be fine in 2024, Stellantis released a profit warning and said it would end the year burning around EUR 10B in cash. This is why we now see that Stellantis' cash balance was EUR 32.4B at the end of 2024 and is now around EUR 29B. During the sales release, Stellantis only said that in the second half, it will improve its FCF generation versus the first half of the year, which ended with EUR -3B. So, I think what Stellantis meant by saying it will improve its result is that it won't be FCF positive, but that it will lose less. Let's say it will burn EUR 1.5B. We have a cash position that could be sitting at EUR 27B. When we subtract the large investment that was announced, we see that each year, Stellantis will use at least EUR 3.25B. Moreover, when such a large industrial plan is announced, we can expect that the largest part of this capital will be deployed in the early stages, thus severely impacting the next two fiscal years. In the meantime, Stellantis has become a net debt-positive company, thus eliminating one of the reasons why many of us considered it a steal just a few years ago. Now, although the company is back to a share price below $10, its fundamentals have changed. Right now, Stellantis is burning cash. Secondly, it has lost meaningful market share in its most profitable market. Third, its margins have come down from 12% to 4%-5%. Of course, the stock is being re-rated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While from a top-line revival perspective, this sales report could be considered encouraging, cash flow generation is still to be recovered. Therefore, the investment thesis can solely rely right now on considering Stellantis a turnaround play and not a fundamentally undervalued company. After all, the plunge in earnings will likely make Stellantis report negative EPS this year, which means that the PE ratio doesn't make sense anymore. Right now, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLA/valuation/metrics\">fwd PE sits at 24.2</a>, but it must be taken with a grain of salt. I would rather use the EV/EBITDA ratio: the TTM is 16.8, while the fwd is 3.7. This is a big difference and it shows how compressed Stellantis' EBITDA has been in the past 4 quarters. At the same time, many believe it will come back to more normal levels of around ERU 10B. We will have to wait one more quarter before we see some financial numbers, but we should not be so unrealistic as to expect the company to be back to EUR 20B in EBITDA soon. Considering that its cash position will decrease, we will have an EV that goes up, meaning that the ratio could expand as a result of the change in the capital structure of the company.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No matter how I twist it, and as much as I don't like what I am saying since I wish Stellantis would achieve success, I don't see any room to step back in the stock. As a turnaround play, the tide is still highly uncertain, and the stock resembles more of a value trap rather than an undervalued opportunity.

The pullback from greenback's best level has been shallow. The US struck several<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> trade deals this week and secured a trade truce with China, even if many are skeptical of its longevity, and the Federal Reserve pushed against a December cut, and the futures market has reduced the odds to about 2/3rd from near certainty. Emerging market currencies are mixed, but this week's highlights include the PBOC setting the dollar's fix at a new low since October on Wednesday before steadying it in the last two sessions, and the (3.6%) recovery of the Argentine peso following last Sunday's election.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Nikkei (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKY:IND\" title=\"NIKKEI 225 Index\">NKY:IND</a>) extended its weekly advance today. The 2.1% gain today brings the weekly rise to 6.3%. Most of the other large equity markets in the region but South Korea's Kospi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOSPI\" title=\"KOSPI Index\">KOSPI</a>) weakened today. Yet, the MSCI Asia Pacific index is closing higher on the week and is securing its seventh consecutive monthly advance. Europe's STOXX 600 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX\" title=\"STOXX Europe 600 Index\">STOXX</a>) is weaker for the fourth consecutive session, which matches its longest decline since June. Still, it is poised to settle higher for the fourth consecutive month. Helped by Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), US index futures are trading higher today. The S&amp;P 500 (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>) and Nasdaq (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a>) will settle higher for the sixth and seventh consecutive months, respectively. European and US 10-year benchmark yields are slightly firmer today. Near 4.10%, the 10-year US Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US10Y</a>) is up around 12 bp this week, the most among the G10 countries. Gold is trading heavier, and barring a significant recovery, will settle lower in back-to-back weeks for the first time since July. December WTI is hovering near $60 and is off about 2% this week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>USD: </strong>A combination of the hawkish cut by the Fed and what appears to be an important de-escalation of US-China trade tensions (with some hope it can last a year) helped lift the Dollar Index to a new high for the month, near 99.70. Since the high was recorded in early North American turnover yesterday, DXY has remained above 99.40. Today's consolidation, near yesterday's high, looks constructive, and the next target is the 100.00-100.25 area. October is the second month of the year that DXY has risen and, more broadly, the dollar appreciated against all the G10 currencies. The Dollar Index has risen by around 2% this month despite lower yields, the government shutdown and the anticipation and delivery of the Federal Reserve's second rate cut of the year. The greenback's gains seemed to be a function of market positioning, optimism that the elevated Washington-Beijing tensions were part positioning ahead of new negotiations, and poor developments in Europe and Japan. While the House of Representatives remains out of session, the Senate has symbolically moved this week to check tariffs on Brazil, to end the \"emergency\" that has been used to justify many tariffs and to make SNAP contingency funds available. Yet, without the House's approval, these are symbolic measures but show dissent among some Republican senators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Euro:</strong> The euro held above $1.1600 in the European morning yesterday, but the entry of North American players saw it sold to about $1.1545, a few hundredths of a cent above the month's low. It is holding today, but the single currency has barely traded above previous support near $1.1575. A break of the $1.1540 area leaves little on the charts ahead of the late July/early August lows near $1.1400. A move back above $1.16 would help stabilize the technical tone. The US two-year premium over Germany is around 162 bp, the highest since early September. The ECB's decision to stand pat yesterday and comments from President Lagarde suggesting the bar to another cut is high takes the thunder away from today's preliminary October CPI. It rose 0.2% in the month, but due to the base effect, the year-over-year rate slipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. The core rate was steady at 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CNY:</strong> The dollar rose by about 0.25% against the offshore yuan yesterday, its largest single-day advance this month. It reached almost CNH7.1180, and this is holding today. The halfway mark of this year's range is around CNH7.1210. Above there, resistance is seen in the CNH7.1280-7.1300 area. Apparently, the foreign exchange market was not a subject of US-China negotiations. The PBOC set the dollar's fix at CNY7.0880 (CNY7.0864 yesterday and CNY7.0928 a week ago). It is the first back-to-back increase in the dollar's reference rate this month. China's October PMI softened. The manufacturing PMI eased to 49.0 from 49.8. It has been below the 50 boom/bust mark since April. The non-manufacturing PMI has held up better. Although it has not been below 50 this year, it has not been above 50.5 since May. It ticked up to 50.1 from 50.0, the low for the year. The composite eased to 50.0, which is the lowest it has been since the end of 2022 (50.6 in September). It averaged 50.4 in Q2 and Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>JPY:</strong> The backing up of US interest rates, despite or because of the Fed's cut Wednesday, and the BOJ's seeming lack of urgency to raise rates yesterday weighed on the yen. The dollar, which finished last week near JPY152.85, rose to nearly JPY154.45 yesterday, which is the lower end of a resistance band that extends to JPY155. Its consolidation today (between ~JPY153.65 and JPY154.40) looks bullish. The dollar's low for the year was recorded in April a little below JPY140. The high for the year was seen in January, almost JPY159. Today's data may help inform the BOJ's next rate decision. The economy recovered in September from a weak August, and core Tokyo CPI likely signals the direction of the national reading due in a few weeks. The headline and core measures rose from 2.5% to 2.8%. The September jobless rate was steady at 2.6%, while retail sales rose 0.3% after a revised 0.9% decline in August (initially -1.1%) and industrial output rose 2.2% (-1.5% in August). The swaps market has about a 46% chance of a hike in December, down slightly from the end of last week. On the contrary, we suspect the odds have crept up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling has had a tough week, though the economic diary was light. It was sold to a six-month low yesterday, slightly above $1.3115. Although it stabilized and recovered back above the $1.3140 area that held in May and August, the technical tone has deteriorated, and it remains below the 200-day moving average (~$1.3245) for the first time since April. It has held above yesterday's lows today but has been unable to rise above the $1.3165 area. A weekly close below $1.3140 would leave it in a vulnerable position. The main feature next week is the central bank meeting. The swaps market has around 25% chance of a cut. It was less than 10% at the end of last month. One large US investment bank forecasts a BOE cut and is one of the two of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg that anticipate a cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CAD:</strong> After the Bank of Canada cut rates on Wednesday, the US dollar extended its pullback against the Canadian dollar, falling to its lowest level in more than a month, slightly below CAD1.3890. The greenback's surge after the hawkish cut by the Fed lifted it back to around CAD1.3950, and the follow-through action yesterday saw it near CAD1.4015. This met the (61.8%) retracement of the US dollar's retreat from the six-month high recorded on October 14 near CAD1.4080. It is trading quietly (~CAD1.3980-1.4010) but firmly in the upper end of yesterday's range. StatCan is expected to shortly report that the economy stagnated in August after growing 0.2% in July. The monthly GDP has not risen for two consecutive months since September-October 2024. The Bank of Canada delivered its fourth rate cut of the year on Wednesday, and the official comments confirm what the market already suspected: the bar to another cut is high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AUD:</strong> The Australian dollar rallied from around $0.6445 on October 17 to about $0.6615 before the Federal Reserve's rate cut on October 29. Yesterday, it was sold to almost $0.6530 to meet the (50%) retracement of the rally. While yesterday's low is holding, the Aussie has barely traded to $0.6560. A break of $0.6530 can spur a move toward $0.6500. The elevated CPI reading on Wednesday is understood as practically ruling out a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week. Today's Q3 PPI does not change that calculus. It rose 1.0% (0.7% in Q2), and the year-over-year rate edged up to 3.5% (from 3.4% in Q2).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>MXN:</strong> The dollar broke out of the narrow consolidative range to the upside and briefly traded above MXN18.60 yesterday for the first time in two and a half weeks. The high for the month set on October 10 was a little below MXN18.64, while the high from October 14 was slightly below MXN18.63. The dollar is holding above MXN18.50 today. It has not spent an entire session above there since September 10. The 0.3% contraction in Q3 GDP that Mexico reported yesterday reinforces speculation that Banxico will cut rates next week to 7.25% from 7.50%. It will be the seventh rate cut this year for a cumulative reduction of 275 bp. In 2024, the central bank cut 125 bp. Brazil's central bank also meets next week. It is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00%, where it has been since June. The US dollar recovered from BRL5.3345 on Wednesday and approached the week's high and the 20-day moving average near BRL5.3950 yesterday. The next area of resistance is around BRL5.4050-5.4300. Coming into today, the US dollar has fallen by about 3.5% against the Argentine peso since this week, since Milei's party did better than expected in the election. The 10-year dollar bond yield has fallen by almost 25 bp this week. Although the US Treasury has declared victory, for many market participants the jury is still out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.marctomarket.com/2025/10/bullish-dollar-consolidation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\" title=\"DocuSign, Inc.\">DOCU</a></span>) experienced a major boom during the pandemic, unsurprisingly. However, as the world returned to normalcy, the stock has essentially erased all those gains. Early this year, I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756902-docusign-stock-dont-sign-me-up\">initiated the stock</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> at a sell rating, citing weak fundamentals and overvaluation.

Top line growth remains sluggish, and billings guidance was uninspiring. Profitability also seems to be under pressure as both gross and operating margins contract, so despite the introduction of AI tools into their solutions, not much is going right for the company at this point. That said, the forward P/E ratio has contracted to a justified level, so I have decided to upgrade DocuSign to a hold rating on the basis of valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"652\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rating History\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Too Many Customers?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"881\" data-height=\"529\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is it possible to have too many users or customers?

While that is still a satisfactory growth rate, as you can see above, revenue growth has been very sluggish since late calendar 2023. There is some rebound in growth from the previous quarter, but overall, it may be too early to conclude that an inflection point is in. Still, they were able to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">beat analysts' expectations</a> by $20.05 million, so results are better than feared. Looking at their subscription revenues specifically, there has also been recent sluggishness with growth at just 9% as well. Therefore, there hasn't been enough acceleration to show that growth is truly headed in the right direction. Their billings do show some better signs, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1082\" data-height=\"677\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Billings\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While revenues aren't showing many signs of improving business activity, the company's billings show that the worst may be over.

Also note that the rolling four-quarter YoY growth rate has ticked up notably to 9%.

For gross margin there was notable contraction, especially for their core subscription business. For subscriptions, gross margin contracted by 40 basis points, while the company as a whole saw a contraction of 20 basis points. This could indicate that cost control hasn't been great, but it also may show that clients aren't opting for their higher-margin products. That client behavior could be a concern moving forward.

While I see no problem with the increase in R&amp;D spending as a percentage of revenues, the increases in sales &amp; marketing and general &amp; administrative expenses are clearly undesirable. S&amp;M expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by 80 basis points YoY, while G&amp;A expenses increased 90 basis points to 7.9% of revenues. These are clear signs that corporate efficiency has not been favorable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of contracting margins, DocuSign reported an adjusted EPS of $0.92, representing a decline of 5.15% YoY. A bottom-line decline is, of course, not a great sign. Still, they managed to beat analyst estimates by $0.07, so expectations were very low to begin with. Currently, it seems that DocuSign is dealing with problems on two fronts. Top line growth remains sluggish, and profitability is also not headed in the right direction.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guidance Raised</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1342\" data-height=\"499\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite what I would call lackluster Q2 results, DocuSign was still able to deliver a beat and raise. All of the above FY2026 guidance figures have been <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Financial-Results-Announces-1-0-Billion-Increase-to-Share-Repurchase-Program/\" rel=\"nofollow\">updated favorably,</a> and that is, of course, welcome news for investors. The company is now expecting revenue growth to be at about 7%. That is a slowdown from <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY2025's 8% increase,</a> and so again, the top line isn't showing signs of a re-acceleration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For subscription revenues in particular, the projected 8% increase would be unchanged from FY2025, so at least for their core business, things are shaping up to be steady. That's also the case for billings. Their 7% growth projection would also be unchanged from the previous year. However, recall that Billings growth was 13% in Q2. Therefore, the acceleration we saw may not continue for FY2026 as a whole, and that makes the demand outlook shaky once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for their margins, the above ranges for both gross margin and operating margin are below what we saw in FY2025, so the efficiency and profitability woes we discussed above are also happening in the annual timeframe. Overall, while a raising of guidance is surely welcomed, I believe these updated figures still don't provide much promise that the company has hit an inflection point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Likely Fair</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During this year, DocuSign's forward P/E ratio has continued to trend down. At a current reading of 18.76, the multiple is essentially at one year lows. I believe the valuation correctly reflects the fundamentals right now. Today, we have learned quite a bit about the company. Revenues remain sluggish, and while Q2 billings were quite strong, full year guidance for billings shows that demand remains subdued. Profitability is also under pressure, and if they don't improve their corporate efficiency, the bottom line will pay the price. As stated just above, guidance was raised, but the new figures still don't show that a meaningful turnaround is happening. With that being the case, I find the valuation contraction this year to be unsurprising and justified. Currently, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha shows</a> that DocuSign trades at around a 25% discount to the IT sector according to the non-GAAP forward P/E ratio. Given the struggles the company finds itself in, I would say that this valuation gap is an appropriate reflection of reality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign has been under pressure ever since the pandemic was over, and from today's analysis, it seems the company will continue to experience sluggishness moving forward. As stated above, demand doesn't seem to be overly robust right now despite their expanded solutions portfolio. Furthermore, margin contraction is dragging down their profitability. While normally a beat and raise is a great sign, the updated guidance is still rather lackluster in my view. That said, the forward P/E ratio has come down quite a bit from earlier this year, and since the valuation is now justified, I have decided to upgrade to a neutral rating of hold.</p>",

This is likely due to a good portion of adjustments in gross-to-net rebates related to its inventory in the channel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"989\" data-height=\"483\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BHC Guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bausch Health</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC likely raised its adjusted EBITDA by managing its SG&amp;A spending. Q3 costs were unusually low after the firm changed its accruals for nonrecurring items. Investors should look out for the firm lowering expenses by increasing marketing and operating efficiencies. That might lead to an increase in next year’s guidance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xifaxan is the first of BHC’s growth catalysts. The firm must continue its investments to support Xifaxan and Cabtreo growth. The aesthetics business is the second growth catalyst for its global revenue. BHC is making long-term investments in research and development to support the innovation pipeline. Thermage FCX in Canada and Fraxel FTX in the U.S. are the products that come to mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Innovation in hepatology is BHC’s third growth catalyst. Larsucosterol, from its DURECT acquisition, is undergoing a study for treating alcohol-associated hepatitis. It will start the phase 3 trial by early 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this segment, the RED-C program faces no competition. The market does not have an approved product for the primary prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (“OHE”). The market opportunity is 1.9 million patients in the U.S. BHC has two global Phase 3 studies that it expects will have a readout in early 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock Grades</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC’s momentum grade fell after shares peaked at above $8 in the summer to trade below $6.00 recently. The D+ grade might rise back to a C if its recent rally to $6.61 holds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BHC grades\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"274\" height=\"210\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC’s valuation is strong, with an ‘A’ grade.

I rate Bausch a buy. Shares have lost 5.57% since I last covered the company, compared to a 5.84% gain in the S&amp;P 500. B+L (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLCO\" title=\"Bausch + Lomb Corporation\">BLCO</a>) is also a compelling stock to hold. Seeking Alpha scored BLCO stock a buy with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLCO/ratings/quant-ratings\">a 3.54/5.00 rating</a>. In comparison, BHC stock has a ‘Hold’ rating on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHC/ratings/quant-ratings\">a 2.87/5.00 rating</a>.</p>",

Yet this was eclipsed by<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the value measure of demand, which jumped 44% y/y to a record of US$146bn in Q3.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-to-date demand is 1% higher at 3,717t, equating to US$384bn in value, up 41% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors remained firmly in the driving seat in Q3. Huge ETF buying (+222t), accompanied by a fourth successive quarter of bar and coin demand above 300t (316t) fuelled the rise in overall demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central bank buying remained elevated at 220t, 28% up on the prior quarter, albeit that y-t-d buying of 634t has been at a slower pace than the 724t bought in the first three quarters of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery consumption in Q3 posted a double-digit y/y decline (the sixth in succession) to 371t, as volumes remained under pressure in the record price environment. This contrasts with a 13% y/y increase in value to US$41bn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technology demand was fractionally weaker compared with Q3’24. Support from growing AI demand met with headwinds from US tariff policy and the surging gold price.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Highlights</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The LBMA (PM) gold price hit 13 new all-time highs in the quarter. </strong>The price rose 16% during Q3 and generated an average quarterly price of US$3456.54/oz, up 40% y/y and 5% q/q.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Total gold supply rose 3% y/y to a quarterly record of 1,313t.</strong>Mine production, which typically sees seasonal growth in Q3, was up 2% y/y to 977t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The supply of recycled gold remained elevated but stable at 344t: up 6% y/y, down 1% q/q. </strong>Recycling activity was restrained to some degree by expectations of further price gains and generally supportive economic conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>OTC investment added 55t to Q3 demand. </strong>This measure captures continued widespread global interest from institutions and high net worth individuals, particularly in September.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 1: Investment demand continued to drive

There is some disagreement about how readily these apply; our view is that the reality is more subtle.<sup>1</sup> A weaker dollar during the first nine months of 2025 is largely pinned on hedging activity. US assets may have lost some of their exceptionalism but they remain core to most global portfolios. Hedging will just put the onus on them working a little harder for investors, and a marginal shift into <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828916-gold-market-commentary-stick-twist-or-double-down\" rel=\"noopener\">less crowded assets</a> is prudent portfolio management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anticipated US policy rate cuts is another key pillar for investors. While the opportunity cost motive remains important, the potential consequences of lower rates add more nuance, potentially reflecting a worsening US economy but also stoking fears of inflation; the by-now familiar theme of stagflation, historically supportive of gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold ETF demand was the standout sector y-t-d. We think the drivers of this demand remain intact even after tonnage holdings eclipsed their 2020 highs. As a share of general portfolios, gold remains under-allocated and a flood of new investors could easily push holdings through the previous peak given the strategic case to do so remains solid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there are tactical risks that could derail further inflows. These include: technical sell signals; a continued easing of tariff tensions; geopolitical resolutions; softening fears of US Fed independence; and a rotation out of gold into ‘cheaper’ assets. Such risks naturally proliferate when prices move this fast and holdings approach previous peaks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some further profit-taking in Q4 would not come as a surprise following the mid-October sell-off, although the selling appears to have been focused outside of the gold ETF market, possibly driven by Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) activity.<sup>2</sup> We remain optimistic on North American and European demand and view the economic and political backdrop as constructive for resumed buying of any dips. Our forecast is raised and our confidence bands narrowed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the FOMO bar and coin trade in full swing – helped along by geopolitical concerns – we maintain our positive full-year estimate. Gold’s rapid price rise has not been a deterrent as it has been on occasion historically. On the contrary, retail activity chasing rising prices should be a boon for the sector, particularly following short-term corrections. This applies broadly across geographies, with China and India seen picking up steam in Q4. Trade tensions and economic pessimism will likely drive Chinese buying, while Indian investors may eschew jewellery in favour of lower margin bar and coin. Anecdotally, softer US bar and coin demand appears to have sharply reversed at the start of Q4.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fabrication</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A glum start to Q3’25 was on the cards for jewellery demand. Although China’s demand in tonnes echoed the lows of the Global Financial Crisis, a q/q pickup and strong spending provided some welcome relief. Any price softness in Q4 will indicate how quickly and confidently consumers adjust to prices. Given how prolonged the slump has been and how strongly prices have risen, the recovery might not be rapid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indian volume demand was also weak but did not plumb crisis-level depths. A likely resilient economy ahead should also give us useful statistics on price adjustment in Q4, absent a sharp move higher or lower in prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other regions mirrored consumption patterns in the two largest purchasing centres, one reason models of global demand tend to be quite straightforward to construct. Jewellery responds quite consistently across geographies to price, lagged price adjustments and changes in income. Given no major expected changes in income on a global level in Q4 (albeit that broad income growth remains supportive longer-term), price movements and consumer adjustment are likely to dictate the sectors final quarter tally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is little to be added to what we have said previously about technology demand. Price pressure is a constant feature for an industry accustomed to thrifting. But at the same time it continues to benefit from the AI boom. This tug of war will likely flatten demand for the year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central banks</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central banks are likely to continue their buying spree. Our full year estimate of between 750-900t – barring any surprises - is lower than last year, but remains – in line with y-t-d flows – surprisingly resilient given strong price rises. Upside and downside risks are balanced, dictated largely by price volatility. However, three factors make us positive on continued demand in Q4 and beyond:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Major EM countries’ FX reserves growth (y/y) is forecast to pick up in Q4</li> <li>Demand has broadened, with hitherto dormant banks becoming active</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795736-central-bank-gold-reserves-survey-2025\" rel=\"noopener\">Our 2025 central bank survey</a> showed the strongest intention to continue buying since it was initiated in 2019.</li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supply</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The theme of production growth from ramp-ups and new projects led by Ghana, Canada and Australia could take production to a new record in FY2025. However, suspension of a few operations makes the prediction a little less certain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong prices will likely continue to incentivise hedging contracts to expire naturally, and this is likely to remain a negligible feature of total mine supply. But while prices are materially higher than the last quarter, the themes remain unchanged. A more significant price drop, unlikely in our view, could encourage some producers to lock in prices. Although, looking back at the largest drawdowns during recent rallies, our data shows no discernible aggregate rise in hedging (Q4 2008: -49t, Q4 2016: -24t and Q4 2023:+21t )</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling continues to undershoot expectations. Distress-selling will likely require a large dent in consumer balance sheets which we have not seen. The selling back we have seen appears opportunistic, and this if often a feature of a healthy rally in its early innings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling is likely to be muted unless store closures escalate, but there is scant evidence of that from China. We do note caution in India, where a material drop in gold prices could induce forced selling to cover loans collateralised with gold jewellery. All in all, a relatively healthy global economy, alongside widespread expectations of higher prices from analysts are likely reticence of people to sell back.<sup>3</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold jewellery volumes plunge, while values soar</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Surging, record-high gold prices in Q3 resulted in a sharp y/y drop in gold jewellery consumption</li> <li>Global demand fell to its weakest for a third quarter since the Covid-hit low of 2020</li> <li>Value measures of demand, in contrast, were almost universally higher, as consumers spent more on jewellery.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Tonnes</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'25</strong></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Y/y % change</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>World total</td> <td>460.0</td> <td>371.3</td> <td>-19</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-down.svg\" alt=\"Gold Demand Trends: Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>India</td> <td>171.6</td> <td>117.7</td> <td>-31</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-down.svg\" alt=\"Gold Demand Trends: Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>China, P.R.: Mainland</td> <td>102.4</td> <td>83.8</td> <td>-18</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-down.svg\" alt=\"Gold Demand Trends: Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 3: Gold price saw another record-breaking quarter</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Daily gold price in key currencies, indexed to 1 January 2025*</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1118\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 3: Gold price saw another record-breaking quarter\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"258\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, ICE Benchmark Administration, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 jewellery demand fell y/y across all markets, almost without exception. While the two market giants – India and China – each saw a seasonal q/q uplift in demand, the y/y picture was decidedly weak. The record gold price environment was the primary reason for the decline, simply due to affordability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, the value of jewellery consumption – at US$41bn – was 13% higher y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold jewellery consumption is 18% lower y-t-d at 1,095t, although so far remains comfortably above the 2020 low of 894t. The value of gold jewellery bought globally y-t-d has reached US$112bn, a record for our data series and 14% above the US$99bn from 2024.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Headwinds from the high gold price and lacklustre consumer sentiment pushed gold jewellery consumption down to 84t, the weakest Q3 since 2007. This brought y-t-d Chinese gold jewellery consumption to 278t, down by a quarter compared to Q1-Q3 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The q/q comparison, however, shows an uptick in demand, primarily due to seasonal factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the picture looks different when we consider demand in value terms. In Q3, Chinese consumers spent RMB66bn (US$9bn) on gold jewellery – the second highest Q3 spend ever, just short of the Q3’23 record of RMB71bn (US$10bn).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a typically slow July, demand began to recover toward the end of August, supported by Chinese Valentine’s Day gifting.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, a period of relatively stable gold prices in July and August allowed consumers time to adjust to the higher price level. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830948-china-gold-market-update-wholesale-demand-rebounded\" rel=\"noopener\">Wedding-related gold purchases ahead of the early October Golden Week</a> – a popular period for marriages – also boosted demand to some extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conventional and more heavily-designed 24k jewellery suffered the sharpest losses, while lighter-weight pieces were relatively resilient. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830757-2025-chinese-jewellery-retailer-insights-gold-self-wear-remain-key\" rel=\"noopener\">Hard Pure gold items continued to outperform relative to others</a>; greater affordability, as well as innovative designs and the creative use of materials like gems and enamel, helped drive this outperformance. Retailers also increased their efforts to promote items with high premiums and intricate craftsmanship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seasonal patterns suggest further demand pick up in Q4, but demand volumes are likely to stay well below long-term averages as the gold price remains extremely elevated. The surging international gold price disrupted gold jewellery sales during the early October eight-day Golden Week holiday. Moreover, a later-than-usual Chinese New Year’s holiday next year may delay both retailer replenishment and lunar year-end consumer purchase – a traditional peak season for gold.<sup>5</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the bright side, potential further easing of monetary or fiscal policy, as well as the possibility of a stabilising gold price, could offer some support for gold jewellery demand.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 4: Record price pressured gold jewellery demand volumes, but boosted value</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Quarterly gold jewellery consumption, tonnes and value*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1134\" data-height=\"470\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 4: Record price pressured gold jewellery demand volumes, but boosted value\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: ICE Benchmark Administration, Metals Focus, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">India</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">India had its weakest third quarter for jewellery consumption since 2020, at 118t, reflecting the surging local gold price, which surpassed the Rs117,000/10g level during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The value measure of demand was more resilient. Q3 spending of Rs1,143bn (US$13bn) was on a par <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733071-gold-demand-trends-q3-2024\" rel=\"noopener\">with the very strong quarter of Q3’24</a>, when demand jumped to a nine-year high following a cut in Indian import duties. The value of demand y-t-d has reached a record Rs2,513bn (US$29bn).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The domestic gold price rise was magnified by local currency depreciation during the quarter. This, and a lack of major festivals and weddings, kept a lid on jewellery buying during July and August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand was ignited in September, however; the accelerating price rally triggered consumers to purchase before prices rose further. Anecdotally, the end of Shradh (a 15-day inauspicious period for gold buying) on 21st September saw a rush of demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rising price has not only increased the demand for lighter-weight and lower-carat pieces, but consumers are also increasingly willing to exchange old gold jewellery, rather than buy new gold items outright. Furthermore, there seems to be evidence that demand is shifting away from jewellery towards lower-margin, small investment products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">18k plain jewellery has seen increased acceptance across many parts of the country, at the expense of more traditional 22k. But demand from wealthier consumers has so far held firm, reflected in relatively strong sales of high-value jewellery items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 also saw a continuation of the trend for Indian consumers to use their gold jewellery as collateral for loans. Data suggests that, so far this year, consumers have pledged at least 220t of gold jewellery in this way, helping to keep a lid on the domestic supply of recycled gold.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle East and Turkey</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sharply rising local gold price kept jewellery demand in Turkey under considerable pressure in Q3. Demand of 26t during the first three quarters is on a par with that of 2021 – a year in which the gold price averaged US$1,769.6/oz.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer inflation in Turkey remains very punitive, eroding consumer sentiment and purchasing power alike. Continued domestic and regional geopolitical tensions have also contributed to weakness in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand was similarly weak for virtually all markets across the Middle East, with sharply higher gold prices impacting affordability – and encouraging some selling-back of high-carat jewellery – and regional geopolitics negatively affecting consumer sentiment. Iran was the exception, where a y/y increase in gold jewellery demand was motivated by safe-haven investment buying.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">US and Europe</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery demand in the US extended the downtrend that has been in place since Q2’22. Demand of 25t was the weakest for a third quarter in our data series back to 2000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contrastingly, demand measured in value terms continues to go from strength to strength. US gold jewellery spend grew to US$3bn in Q3 – the ninth consecutive y/y increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling volumes were due to the high and rising gold price, which continued to impact affordability, with consumers shifting to lower-carat, lighter-weight items as well as reducing their frequency of purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets across Europe witnessed universal declines in jewellery volumes, with France seeing the most pronounced contraction. Mirroring the global pattern, demand in value terms was positive, showing that consumers were prepared to spend more on gold jewellery, albeit that this translated to lower volumes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets for which we report data universally witnessed declines in gold jewellery volumes in Q3 as record-high prices squeezed consumer purchasing power. For much of the region, demand in value terms made double-digit y/y gains, in contrast to the notable weakness in tonnage volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indonesia, was the only country to also see a y/y fall in the value of demand. Constrained by surging gold prices and higher costs of living amid challenging economic conditions, consumers continued to shift towards low-carat items.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rest of Asia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A double-digit decline in Japanese jewellery demand resulted in the weakest Q3 on record, at just 3t. Demand for kihei chains (plain chains often bought as a quasi-investment) was healthy and offered some support, with reports suggesting this trend gathered pace in October as the price rally surged and domestic demand exploded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long-term downtrend in South Korean jewellery demand continued in Q3. Consumption was supported in part by the wedding season, and by consumers bringing forward purchases in anticipation of yet higher prices. But nevertheless, the continued trend for lower-carat items eroded volumes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australian gold jewellery demand in Q3 registered its ninth consecutive quarter of y/y decline. The US dollar value of demand was opposingly positive, as the high price supported value but supressed volumes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Table 2: Jewellery demand in selected countries,

stellar gold price rise during Q3 was largely the result of an acceleration in investment demand across all formats – bars, coins and gold ETFs. Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and US dollar weakness continued to fuel safe-haven flows, with added impetus from growing concerns over US Fed independence and the US government shut down. And the surging price, in turn, attracted more investment flows, with investors spurred by FOMO, clamouring to build gold positions and benefit from further gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Y-t-d investment demand has reached 1,566t – just 6% shy of the peak seen in Q1-Q3’20.</strong> In value terms, however, we’re in uncharted territory: investment for the first nine months of the year amounted to US$161bn – well over double that of the same period last year (US$63bn) and 74% above the prior US$92bn record from 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment demand has generated a significant share of total gold demand this year: bar, coin and gold ETF demand has accounted for over half of total demand so far in 2025, up from less than one third last year.<sup>6</sup> This comes at the expense of jewellery, in part as some consumers chose to shift to the more cost-effective investment market to gain gold exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anecdotal reports suggest that there was widespread global interest in gold, particularly in September. The rise in <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-open-interest\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">net long positioning on COMEX</a> during the quarter is indicative of this increased interest, which is captured in the 55t of OTC and stock flows in Q3. It’s worth noting that this figure also reflects any statistical residual from the balance of other demand and supply estimates in our model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment-friendly environment for gold that has persisted throughout the year so far remains in place for now, given still-heightened geopolitical uncertainty, ongoing US dollar weakness and expectations for future US rate cuts. Added to which, richly valued equity markets have not only highlighted gold’s role as a diversifier, but also its role as a hedge against potential equity market corrections. The stage therefore looks set for continued strength in investment flows, a trend that has been observed so far in Q4.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 5: Gold ETFs have had their strongest y-t-d inflows since 2020</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Quarterly ETF demand and assets under management (AUM), by region*</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1124\" data-height=\"463\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 5: Gold ETFs have had their strongest y-t-d inflows since 2020\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"264\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, ICE Benchmark Administration, Company Filings, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETFs</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828631-gold-etf-flows-september-2025\">Q3 was a record quarter for gold-backed ETFs</a>. Global inflows reached US$26bn, eclipsing the previous quarterly record of US$24bn set in Q2 2020. In volume terms, Q3 demand of 222t took total holdings to 3,838t, just 2% shy of the 3,929t peak from November 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand for gold ETFs has been a key contributor to gold’s price performance so far in 2025 and Q3 was no exception, particularly in September as the momentum behind inflows accelerated across all regions. And that also generated a ‘virtuous circle’, as investment flows were further attracted by the continued rise in the gold price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>North American-listed funds added 139t (US$16bn) during the third quarter</strong>, taking total regional holdings to 1,996t (US$246bn in AUM), around 100t shy of the record levels reached in October 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>European-listed funds added 70t</strong>, the strongest quarterly tonnage increase since Q1’22, yielding y-t-d demand of 148t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Meanwhile, demand for gold ETFs listed in Asia remained positive</strong> but slowed markedly in Q3, to 13t. The region has now witnessed eight consecutive quarters of growth, during which holdings have increased by 200t to 334t. India saw the largest growth in Q3 (+11t). Japanese funds attracted 6t of inflows, which offset the 6t of outflows from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Funds listed in other regions barely changed</strong>, as outflows in South Africa balanced out growth in Australia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Y-t-d, gold ETFs have added 619t (US$64bn). North American-listed funds absorbed the bulk of these flows (346t,US$37bn), although there was also sizable demand for ETFs listed in Europe (148t, US$14bn) and Asia (118t, US$12bn). Healthy demand has continued into Q4, with strong October inflows noted at the time of writing, particularly into US- and Asian-listed funds. Nevertheless, historical analysis suggests gold ETFs have still room to grow.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bar and coin</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global investment in gold bars and coins exceeded 300t for a fourth successive quarter – a feat not achieved since 2013.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FOMO was rife, particularly during September as the gold price rally really took off. This added to the already strong safe-haven flows driven by global geopolitical concerns, with further support likely from some jewellery consumers switching to lower-margin pure investment products. With only one or two exceptions, investment markets across the globe made strong y/y gains.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bar and coin demand in Q3 extended the broad upward channel that has been in place since the lockdown lows of H1’22. Although down by a third compared with the strongest Q2 for 12 years, demand was bang in line with its quarterly five-year average and y-t-d – at 313t – is only 23t shy of its full year 2024 total.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment activity was relatively soft during July and August, as the gold price range traded and local equities surged. However, investor appetite was rekindled in September by the rallying gold price and fading equity momentum. And we believe that continued monthly announcements of central bank gold buying further supported investor confidence in gold during Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far in 2025, the key drivers of gold investment have been the unprecedented gold price rally, US-China trade tensions and concerns over the strength of domestic economic growth. With this in mind, we expect gold investment to stay strong as we head towards year-end. Continued flare-ups in US-China the trade conflict should keep safe-haven demand elevated; and the potential for rate cuts to stimulate decelerating economic growth should further support bar and coin investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.gold.org/news-and-events/press-releases/chinas-insurance-funds-inject-new-vitality-global-and-domestic-gold\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inclusion of Chinese insurers in the gold market</a> following regulatory changes earlier this year should provide longer-term support for China’s gold investment demand. Public information available suggests that, as of Q3, six insurers in the pilot program have become Shanghai Gold Exchange’s members, paving the way for their gold allocation. As at the time of writing, however, no fund had disclosed purchases.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">India</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">India saw sustained strong demand for gold bars and coins during Q3 as the rising domestic price attracted investors. A depreciating rupee through much of the quarter meant that the local price of gold continued to strengthen even when the international price was rangebound. This continued upward momentum in the price attracted investors keen not to miss out on the rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Y-t-d demand of 184t is the strongest for a first nine-month period since 2013, and is just shy of the average post-covid full-year demand of 196t.<sup>7</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The value of Q3 investment was exceptional, surpassing US$10bn. This is the highest quarterly value on record by some margin, 56% higher than the previous record of U$7bn from Q4’24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While investment demand was consistently strong throughout the quarter, it accelerated in September, both as the price rally gained momentum and as the festive season drew closer. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some jewellery consumers may have opted for other ways to buy gold, such as bar and coins, which are closer to the local spot price. The surge in buying was reflected in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830950-india-gold-market-update-festive-shine\" rel=\"noopener\">domestic gold price moving to a premium relative to the international price</a>, a trend that has persisted so far into October.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle East and Turkey</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment demand in the Middle East region followed a broadly similar pattern to other markets: relatively subdued in the first two months of the quarter before gathering pace in September as the price rally took off. The first two months of the quarter saw heightened levels of profit-taking as the gold price stabilised close to then-record highs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran was an exception to the regional trend: demand earlier in the quarter was supported by safe-haven buying, which was choked off by the steep and rapid rise in local gold prices, which ultimately proved too financially prohibitive for many investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, in Turkey, investment demand was up from the very low base of Q3’24, but remains well below the heightened levels of the preceding couple of years. The high interest rates paid on lira savings accounts continued to draw investor attention away from gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand was particularly weak during July and August as the rangebound gold price encouraged profit-taking, which was reflected in the local price moving to occasional discounts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand ramped up sharply in September, quickly gathering steam and pushing local premiums up to above $100/oz. Demand has remained strong in the opening weeks of Q4, with premiums remaining very elevated.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The West</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US gold bar and coin market witnessed another sharp decline in net gold investment demand – the only market to see a y/y decline in Q3. Demand sank to 7t – the lowest since the pre-covid 2017-19 trough. The weak Q3 figure, however, masks a very healthy level of two-way activity, as strong buying was met by continued profit taking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand improved in September as gold breached new record highs, which stemmed liquidations as investors began to revise up their price expectations.

In line with the global pattern, the surging gold price combined with heightened global geopolitical concerns sparked strong investor interest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thailand saw its strongest quarter since Q1’19, while Indonesian investment reached levels not seen for over 12 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vietnam was again the outlier. Investment was slightly lower y/y, although this was apparently not for lack of demand. Contacts report queues building outside gold stores, but a shortage of gold in the domestic market led to limits being imposed on the number of gold products per customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vietnamese government announced during the quarter that, effective 10 October, it would abolish the State monopoly on gold bar production and imports. This is expected to reduce the premium on domestic gold products.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rest of Asia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan saw modest net buying in Q3. As the price reached new record highs in September, investors rushed to buy gold, but liquidations also remained sizeable throughout the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the end of Q3, as the local price broke up through ¥20,000/g, <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/precious-metals/article-870044\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">demand has exploded,</a> with stores reportedly running out of stocks of small bars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korean investors were similarly attracted by the gold price rally, with domestic prices further fuelled by a depreciating currency. Y-t-d demand in Korea has reached a record high for our data series of 18t.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gold price rally sparked a y/y jump in Australian gold bar and coin investment in Q3, a trend that has continued into October with some dealers apparently running out of stock and reports of<a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/golds-spectacular-price-rise-continues-as-new-record-high-hit/news-story/57b763892d1e32c0e3dd2a2ccb575ff6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> long queues forming outside bullion retailers.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Modest profit-taking activity was noted in August and July, which dropped in September as price expectations grew increasingly positive.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Table 3: Total bar and coin demand in selected countries, tonnes</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span

But this dynamic has shifted this year: the prospect of US tariff hikes encouraged a surge in demand during H1 as a pre-emptive move to avoid tariffs, and, as a result, Q3 demand was negatively impacted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Record gold prices continued to exert pressure on the industry, with manufacturers often compelled to identify cost savings. Thrifting and substitution efforts are reportedly accelerating, and this may have a long-term impact for gold demand across many electronics applications.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Electronics</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A flat quarter was dominated by ongoing strength in AI-related demand set against uncertainty in the broader consumer electronics market. </strong>As reported during previous quarters, AI server construction and data centre deployment continues to experience robust growth, while demand for end-user consumer products recorded only a modest recovery, constrained by persistently high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. Research firm Omdia has reported that the five major smartphone manufacturers recorded y/y growth during Q3, but remain cautious as “economic fears and uncertainty continue to weigh on vendors’ strategic planning”.<sup>14</sup> Regionally, while Asian demand strengthened, a slight decline in the US, along with continued weakness in the European manufacturing industry, contributed to the overall global slowdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold used in light emitting diodes (LEDs) fell during Q3. </strong>The sector faced headwinds from a slowdown in mainstream applications, most notably the backlight sector as some manufacturers adopted conservative inventory strategies due to macroeconomic uncertainty. This translated to a small fall in panel manufacturer utilisation for the quarter, a negative trend anticipated to persist for the remainder of 2025 and further depressing the outlook for the backlight segment. The automotive sector’s continued pursuance of advanced lighting and display technologies has accelerated the penetration of mini-LEDs, eroding traditional LED uptake and negatively impacting gold volumes. Finally, growth was reported in some high-value, specialised segments, such as horticultural lighting and UV/IR LED, but this niche market expansion was insufficient to fully offset the decline in high-volume mainstream shipments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The wireless sector returned to modest growth during the quarter as demand for mobile power amplifiers (PA) and Wi-Fi chips strengthened.</strong> Compound semiconductors are of growing importance in this sector;<sup>15</sup> manufacturers are increasingly deploying them to enter high-growth, non-PA segments such as satellites, high-altitude drones, and solar battery management modules. This is likely to support gold demand in the sector going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Demand for gold in the memory sector recorded an increase during Q3</strong>. The primary catalyst for growth was the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. A severe supply crisis in the traditional hard disk drive (HDD) market (which saw lead times increase to over 52 weeks) created a spike in demand for alternative NAND flash solutions, boosting gold usage. While some substitution pressures were reported in the DRAM sector, the ongoing widespread adoption of AI will likely remain the primary driver of growth in the memory sector over the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The printed circuit board (PCB) also registered growth in Q3.</strong> Strong performance was recorded in AI server infrastructure, satellite communications, consumer graphics cards, and PC market applications. AI server demand was the single most significant factor driving growth, propelling gold usage through continuous specification upgrades. The automotive market was the only major PCB segment to decline in Q3, primarily from the negative impact of high US tariffs on imported cars, and the phasing out of electric vehicle subsidies in Europe and the US, which suppressed overall automotive market momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the aggregate level, there was a mixed performance for the four major electronics fabrication hubs in Q3: Japan - 19t (-4%); US - 16t (-2%), Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR - 21t (unchanged); South Korea - 7t (+1%).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other industrial and dentistry</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 saw a 5% decline in gold used in other industrial and decorative applications (primarily in gold plating as well as in gold thread, known as jari, used in traditional Indian clothing).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China’s relatively weak economy, and the continued trend for jewellery store closures, negatively impacted plating demand. In India the record-high local gold price had a mixed impact: higher demand for gold used in plating (as consumers shifted away from more expensive solid gold items) contrasted with a decline in jari.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The record price further eroded gold used in dental applications, which stood at 2t for Q3.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supply</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total supply hit a new third quarter record</h4> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Total gold supply in Q3 gained 3% y/y to reach a quarterly record of 1,313t</li> <li>Mine production – which typically sees seasonal growth in Q3 – was up 2% y/y and 8% q/q at 977t; also a record quarter for our data series</li> <li>The supply of recycled gold remained elevated at 344t, 6% higher y/y but marginally lower q/q despite the US dollar gold price surging 16% during the quarter.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Tonnes</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'25</strong></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Y/y % change</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total supply</strong></td> <td><strong>1,275.9</strong></td> <td><strong>1,313.1</strong></td> <td><strong>3</strong></td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-up.svg\" alt=\"Total supply hit a new third quarter record\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mine production</td> <td>957.6</td> <td>976.6</td> <td>2</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-up.svg\" alt=\"Total supply hit a new third quarter record\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net producer hedging</td> <td>-6.5</td> <td>-8.0</td> <td>-</td> <td>-</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Recycled gold</td> <td>324.8</td> <td>344.4</td> <td>6</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-up.svg\" alt=\"Total supply hit a new third quarter record\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total supply of gold extended its long-term uptrend; Q3 marked a new record high of 1,313t.

The following markets registered notable growth – largely from a combination of ramp ups or start-ups:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Canada</strong> (+20% y/y), which saw the ongoing ramp up of Blackwater, Cote and Greenstone mines, as well as new production from B2Gold’s Back River project and higher output from a number of existing operations</li> <li> <strong>Ghana</strong> (+9% y/y), due to the continued ramp up of Shandong Gold’s Namdini operation, as well as first gold being poured at Newmont’s Ahafo North at the end of the quarter</li> <li> <strong>Australia</strong> (+6% y/y), where higher production at Gruyere, KCGM and Telfer outweighed lower output from Cadia, where the PC2-3 panel cave expansion project continues</li> <li> <strong>Russia</strong> (+3% y/y), on the back of higher production from a number of mines, which more than offset a fall in production from some of Polyus’ operations due to waste stripping.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several countries witnessed a y/y fall in gold mine production, due to market- or mine-specific factors:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Indonesia</strong> (-37% y/y), as a fatal incident prompted the suspension of operations at Grasberg in September. Waste stripping also resulted in lower production from Batu Hijau</li> <li> <strong>Mali</strong> (-13% y/y), where Loulo-Gounkoto remained suspended due to the continued dispute between owner Barrick and the Malian government<sup>16</sup> </li> <li> <strong>Mexico</strong> (-5% y/y), with production at Equinox Gold’s Los Filos mine still suspended after the expiry of its land access agreement, and where a pit wall movement led to a temporary suspension of operations at Orla Mining’s Camino Rojo mine</li> <li> <strong>Turkey</strong> (-19% y/y), due to lower operations from several operations including Oksüt and Kisladag.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current rate of growth in mine production suggests a record annual total is within reach for 2025. That said, the continued closure of Grasberg will have a significant impact on production in Indonesia, making an accurate prediction more difficult than usual.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Metals Focus’ mine production data includes estimates for artisanal and small scale gold mining (ASGM). The contribution from this source is expected to grow in 2025, given the strong rise in the gold price while costs remain relatively well contained.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/aisc-gold\" rel=\"noopener\">Average all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the gold mining industry increased 12% y/y in Q2 to US$1,578/oz</a>. The 2% quarterly increase in the AISC is partly explained by seasonal factors, with operations typically resuming at full capacity in the second quarter after scheduled shutdowns in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher sustaining capital expenditure, along with greater input costs and larger royalty payments tied to the higher gold price, further contributed to the y/y rise in the AISC.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net producer hedging</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unsurprisingly, in an environment where the gold price is repeatedly reaching all-time highs, gold mining companies have preferred to remain fully exposed to Q3’s rising spot gold price. Initial estimates suggest an 8t reduction in the global hedge book during the quarter. This follows a revised Q2 decline of 25t, down from the initial -7t estimate. Revisions to this data are commonplace, as Gold Demand Trends is published before many companies release their data. Gold mining companies, typically, are unwinding their hedged positions by letting the contracts expire naturally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our quarterly data series shows consistent de-hedging since Q1’24, during which time the hedge book has fallen by a total of 94t, to around 160t.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycled gold</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 gold recycling increased by 6% y/y to 344t. Given the 40% y/y rise in the average quarterly US$ gold price, the recycling response seems surprisingly muted. And this is put into sharper focus when considering the q/q change (one that is arguably more meaningful for recycling). Recycling volumes in Q3 were 1% down on those seen in the previous quarter, despite a 16% rise in the spot gold price between the end of June and the end of September.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Typically, we would expect recycling to respond positively to such a strong price rise. But the size and speed of the gold price rally this year has, it seems, led to an expectation of yet more price rises. This has encouraged restraint in recycling activity in anticipation of further gains, both due to consumers holding back from liquidating and from Indian consumers increasingly pledging gold jewellery as collateral against loans. Moreover, selling prompted by economic distress remains limited, cushioned by relatively benign macro conditions across many major recycling markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nevertheless, recycling volumes are elevated by historical standards.</strong> Y-t-d, supply from this source has reached 1,041t – the second successive year in which it has exceeded 1,000t.

The regional supply of recycled gold in the first nine months of the year is around 40% higher than the average y-t-d volumes over the preceding 10 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling in the <strong>US</strong> has been firming over recent quarters, albeit not to the same extent as in Europe. Instances of distress selling remain rare; instead, the key driver of growth is opportunistic selling to take advantage of the higher gold price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China</strong> was a key driver of the y/y growth in recycling in East Asia, largely due to the higher gold price and retail store closures, which have generated a continued flow of inventory for melt. The q/q comparison was contrastingly weak, as positive price expectations started to kick in and caused people to hold onto their gold in the hope of benefiting from further price gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>India</strong> drove the y/y and q/q decline in South Asia as recycling in this key consumer market remained weak. The rates of exchanging old jewellery for new remain very high, and consumers also continue to pledge their gold jewellery as collateral for loans, capitalising on the high price. Both trends have resulted in lower volumes of gold being sold outright for scrap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling activity across the <strong>Middle East</strong> was universally higher q/q, reflecting the higher gold price and, in some instances, an element of distress selling. On a yearly basis, recycling supply is relatively stable, with gold serving its function as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notes</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revisions to data</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All data is subject to revision in the light of new information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Historical data series</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand and supply data from Q1 2014 are provided by Metals Focus. Data between Q1 2010 and Q4 2013 is a synthesis of Metals Focus and GFMS, Thomson Reuters data, which was created using relatively simple statistical techniques. For more information on this process, please see <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/creating-consistent-historical-demand-and-supply-data-series\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a consistent data series by Dr James Abdey.</a></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Definitions</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bars</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net investment (i.e. gross purchases less gross sales) in small gold bars (1kg and below) sold at the retail level. Where identifiable, this also includes gold bought and stored via online vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Central banks</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net purchases (i.e. gross purchases less gross sales) by central banks and other official sector institutions, including supra national entities such as the IMF. Swaps and the effects of delta hedging are excluded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comex net long positioning</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publishes a weekly <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Commitment of Traders (COT)</a> report that provides information on the positioning of speculative investors in the U.S. futures markets. The report gives the aggregate positions held by traders from the previous Tuesday, including the number of long contracts (that stand to benefit if prices rise) and short contracts (that benefit if they fall). The report is often used as an indicator of market sentiment regarding the price of gold: short positioning reflects bearish sentiment while long positioning reflects bullish sentiment in the gold futures’ markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer demand</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sum of jewellery consumption and total bar and coin investment occurring within a country i.e. the amount (in fine weight) of gold purchased directly by individuals. Technology demand is not included at the individual country level, as it is measured at the point of fabrication rather than at the point of consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Electronics</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume of gold bullion or grain fabricated into components used in the production of electronics, including – but not limited to – semiconductors and bonding wire.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Dentistry</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume of gold bullion or grain fabricated into products destined for dental applications such as dental alloys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold-backed Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and similar </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume of gold held in physical form by open-ended Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and other products such as close-end funds, and mutual funds. Most funds included in this list are fully backed by physical gold. While several funds allow other holdings such as cash, derivatives or other precious metals, we monitor only those funds investing at least 90% in physical gold and appropriately adjust their reported assets to estimate physical holdings only. For funds that include physical holdings of multiple precious metals, the total AUM depicted for such funds is lower than their actual total AUM. Over time, the data set will adapt to most accurately represent the universe of active funds.

Measured on a gross basis (i.e. includes recycled gold). Excludes: purchases funded by the trading-in of existing carat gold jewellery (gold-for-gold exchange); and purchases of second-hand jewellery, other metals plated with gold, and coins and bars used as jewellery. At the global level, it is measured as jewellery fabrication adjusted for changes in inventories held by the trade. At the country level, it is jewellery fabrication adjusted for changes in trade stocks plus imports, less exports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Jewellery fabrication</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery fabrication is the first transformation of gold bullion into semi-finished or finished jewellery. This differs from jewellery consumption as it excludes stock building/de-stocking by manufacturers and distributors. At the individual country level, it also excludes imports or exports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Jewellery inventory</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Changes to the level of jewellery stocks along the jewellery distribution chain, this is the difference between gold fabrication and gold consumption. A negative figure represents a draw-down of stocks when consumption exceeds fabrication. A positive figure represents a build-up of stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>LBMA Gold price PM</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unless otherwise specified, gold price values from 20 March 2015 are based on the LBMA Gold price PM administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBA\" title=\"IB Acquisition Corp.\">IBA</a>), with prior values being based on the London PM Fix. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/gold-prices\" rel=\"noopener\">How is Gold Price Determined | Gold Pricing Primer | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Medals/imitation coins</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fabrication of gold coins without a face value, produced by both private and official/national mints. India dominates this category with, on average, around 75% of the total. ‘Medallion’ is the name given to unofficial coins in India. Medals of at least 99% purity are also included.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mine production</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume (in fine weight) of gold mined globally. This includes an estimate for gold produced by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASGM\" title=\"Virtus AlphaSimplex Global Macro ETF\">ASGM</a>), which is largely informal. For more information, refer to: <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/mine-production\" rel=\"noopener\">Gold Mining Industry Primer | Information About Gold Mining | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Net producer hedging</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The net impact in the physical market of mining companies’ gold forward sales, loans and options positions. Hedging transactions – which release gold to the market from existing above-ground stocks – accelerates the sale of gold. De-hedging – the process of closing out hedged positions – has the opposite impact and will reduce the amount of gold available to the market in any given quarter. Over time, hedging activity does not generate a net change in the supply of gold. For more information, refer to: <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/mine-production\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gold Mining Industry Primer | Information About Gold Mining | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Official coins</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net investment in gold bullion coins (i.e. gross purchases less gross sales) at the retail level. It is equal to the volume of fine gold in coins fabricated by official/national mints which are, or have been, legal tender in the country of issue. It is measured at the country of consumption rather than at the country of origin (for example, the Perth Mint in Australia, sells most of the coins it produces through its global distribution network). In practice it includes the initial sale of many coins destined ultimately to be considered as numismatic rather than bullion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>OTC and other</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This number captures demand in the OTC market (for which data is not readily available), changes to inventories on commodity exchanges, any unobserved changes in fabrication inventories and any statistical residual. It is the difference between total supply and gold demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Other industrial</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold used in the production of compounds, such as Gold Potassium Cyanide, for electro-plating in industrial applications as well as in the production of gold-plated jewellery and other decorative items such as gold thread. India accounts for the bulk of demand in this category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Over-the-counter (OTC)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions (also referred to as ‘off exchange’ trading) take place directly between two parties, unlike exchange trading which is conducted via an exchange.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Recycled gold</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold recovered from fabricated products, including unused trade stocks, which is refined back into bullion. This specifically refers to gold sold for cash. It does not include gold traded-in for other gold products (for example, by consumers at jewellery stores) or process scrap (scrap generated during manufacturing, which never becomes part of a fabricated product but instead returns as scrap to a refiner). For more information, refer to <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/recycling\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gold Recycling Primer | Gold Recycling Process | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technology</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This captures all gold used in the fabrication of electronics, dental, medical, decorative and other technological applications, with electronics representing the largest component of this category. It includes gold destined for plating jewellery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tonne (Metric)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1,000 kg or 32,151 troy oz of fine gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Total bar and coin </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total net investment in gold bars, coins and medals/imitation coins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Total supply</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total of mine production, net producer hedging and recycling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Year-to-date (y-t-d)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Gold Demand Trends, year-to-date refers to the period to the end of the quarter being reviewed (i.e. for Gold Demand Trends Q2 2017, ‘year-to-date’ referred to the period from 31/12/2016 to 30/06/2017).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Footnotes:</span></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[1] </span><span>FT.com | Gold as ‘debasement trade’ doesn’t add up | 9 Oct 2025</span><span>; </span><a href=\"https://robinjbrooks.substack.com/p/the-debasement-trade\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Robin J Brooks | The Debasement Trade | 19 Oct 2025</span></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[2] </span><a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/videos/2025/10/21/gold-futures-print-their-steepest-decline-in-over-10-years-10-2.html\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Gold futures print their steepest decline in over 10 years. - CME Group</span></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[3] </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/deutsche-bank-raises-2026-gold-forecast-4000-bullion-hits-record-highs-2025-09-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>Reuters.com | Deutsche Bank raises 2026 gold forecast to $4,000 as bullion hits record highs | Sep 2025</span></a><span>; </span><a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/commodities/gold-prices\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>Jpmorgan.com | Will gold prices break $4,000/oz in 2026?</span></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[4] Chinese Valentine’s Day (known as the Qixi festival) is celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. </span><span>In 2025, it </span><span>fell</span><span> on </span><span>19 August</span><span>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[5] Lunar New Year falls on 17 February 2026.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[6] </span><span>Investment's</span><span> share of net gold demand is computed using jewellery and technology net of recycling, in addition to bars &amp; coins, ETFs </span><span>and</span><span> central bank demand, which are historically reported on a net basis.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[7] Annual average Indian bar and coin demand for 2021-2024.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>[8] Central bank demand presented here comprises aggregate reported changes as well as an estimate for unreported buying.

This costs them around $1.44 billion, meaning a relatively normal ~80% payout ratio based on this year’s expected Core FFO. Also, something that may go under the radar is that EXR has, as of Q3 2025, the authorization to purchase up to $491.4 million under their buyback program, although they don’t utilize it. This can offer somewhat of a safety net in case the stock falls too much, assuming that the management wants to take advantage of the program.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"733\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Extra Space Storage IR EXR stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>U.S. Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for a general catalyst that's currently unwinding, we have to remember that this type of company ultimately depends a lot on the economy.

In general, many REITs (including those like EXR) could be relatively close in terms of risk-adjusted reward since they depend on similar factors, and they are clearly standing to benefit from cuts. What we now see is basically the opposite of what rate hikes did - when most REITs began to suffer - increasing the theoretical “risk-free” rate to the detriment of this asset class.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1114\" data-height=\"602\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Extra Space Storage IR EXR stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Grand View Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, the long-term trends should continue to be in this industry’s favor, with expectations even as high as a <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/self-storage-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">5.9% CAGR globally</a>, with North America continuing to be key in this market with a 5% CAGR in the US. This is ultimately the result of a mix between a growing population, urbanization, and other well-known trends combined with “upgrades” that can improve demand, such as contactless access, better websites, increased marketing spending, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve also seen Trump’s meeting with Xi that apparently went very well and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html?msockid=20185b8529876fee1a664d1028996e46\" rel=\"nofollow\">even resulted in him cutting tariffs imposed on China</a> and reaching a one-year agreement on rare earth supplies, which can alleviate the market’s recently reignited tariff worries. This is important because the market’s sentiment and expectations around tariffs and the economy have clear effects on the price, with a company like EXR depending quite a lot on the economy and the activity of consumers or businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, we’re still looking at what so far is the second-longest US Government shutdown (and still counting) that - on top of the already very elevated political uncertainty - adds even more fear around what the Fed will do. For example, the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-government-shutdown-may-prompt-first-ever-workaround-inflation-protected-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">halted all data collection and publishing during the shutdown</a>, meaning that Powell and the others will have less updated data in a time when the effects of tariffs could’ve been more visible, leading to uncertainty around the Fed’s next interest rate decision, as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Powell pointed out that a December cut is not yet decided</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair, it wouldn’t be impossible to see Powell be extra careful and either delay this cut or the next one as a result, as he’s already been a critic of tariffs and said how they were the cause for the delayed rate cuts earlier this year. Less data around that can lead to even more delays, which would be bad for REITs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1376\" data-height=\"548\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Extra Space Storage IR EXR stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"255\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

I’ll go for a WACC of 7% (above my estimated ~6.6% based on a cost of equity of ~7.4% and ~4.8% cost of debt), with a net debt of $12.79 billion, $878.8 million in OP-related equity, and 221.3 million shares outstanding as of Q3.

It’s a value ETF that owns some of America’s fastest-growing dividend stocks. I also added Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF™\">SCHD</a>) for its yield. While it may have a slower growth profile than CGDV, it brings a lot more stability and lower volatility to the table. Also, it has a much better income profile, which is key for a portfolio with an average target yield of 5.50%. To further improve the income, I added the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVO\" title=\"Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF\">DIVO</a>), which uses a very conservative covered call strategy to juice the income of the portfolio without adding substantial options risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I also added the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JEPQ\" title=\"JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF\">JEPQ</a>), which applies a covered call strategy to technology stocks. Given the elevated valuation of these stocks and increasing competition risks between the \"big guys,\" I believe a covered call strategy makes a lot of sense in this area going forward. Also, because of higher volatility, the options premiums are much higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, I added higher income through the Alerian MLP ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>), which owns midstream Master Limited Partnerships, and the VanEck Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFXF\" title=\"VanEck Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF\">PFXF</a>), which is a bond proxy due to the high correlation between preferred equities and long-term government bonds.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"974\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my prior article, I did not backtest the model portfolio, which was a huge error. <span class=\"highlighted_text\">Using the iShares Select Dividend ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DVY\" title=\"iShares Select Dividend ETF\">DVY</a>) as a benchmark, we see that since December 2022</span>, the model portfolio has returned 16.6% per year, more than 600 basis points above the 10.22% return of the benchmark ETF.

Nonetheless, it’s data that confirms my thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I’ll make good on my promise and show you my picks for the other half of the 50/50 model portfolio. I will show you how we can use single stocks to add value and which companies I would pick. Needless to say, it’s just food for thought. As I explained in my ETF and so many other articles, every investor is different. I just provide the framework that can help people build their own portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let’s get to it!</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Things To Keep In Mind After Laying A Strong Foundation of ETFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to a strong ETF foundation, we can now add value by adding single stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But how do we do that? Buying random dividend stocks can hardly be the solution, as we already have a basket of diversified dividend income and dividend growth stocks in the ETF part of the portfolio. We need to find something special to add value. If we fail to do that, we may as well make this a 70%, 80%, or even 100% ETF portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, needless to say, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>We need to prevent too much overlap. It’s tough, given how much diversification we have, but it’s doable.</li> <li>We need to focus on the qualities we usually incorporate. This includes healthy dividend payout ratios, strong balance sheets, and business models that provide these companies with an edge. I’m not using the words \"wide moat\" here because REITs and some other good income stocks have no moats (capital is often the only constraint in the real estate business), yet they have other advantages that make them good investments.</li> <li>We need a consistently rising income to protect our income against inflation.</li> <li>We need to be aware that adding too many single stocks defeats the purpose of the 50/50 portfolio. We should stick to our highest-conviction ideas. However, we should also avoid adding too few stocks. For example, giving stock XYZ a 20% weighting would make it as important as the entire SCHD ETF in the model portfolio.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I would use various buckets to get a better overview of what we’re looking for and to make sure we maintain prudent diversification. For example, when I wrote about my retirement pyramid strategy, I used the overview below. I used three baskets with very different requirements for income and growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1020\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the pyramid strategy is mainly used on growth and income differences, the situation in this article is a bit more complex, as we don’t sort based on income and yield but on structural differences between stocks and the ETFs the model portfolio already owns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally (you may go into a different direction), I would go with the following buckets:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>I would go with a core of proven dividend compounders. These can be similar to the ones that SCHD owns, with yields of 3-5% and above-inflation dividend growth. Let’s call this the Stability Core.</li> <li>Then, I would go with a group of stocks that do not yet have a great ETF to represent them. These are essential infrastructure and energy stocks for inflation-resistant income and higher income. We can call this Hard Asset Value (or something else, as this is just a placeholder name for simplicity).</li> <li>I would obviously include Income Boosters, which are high-yield stocks that may not always have moats but have strong and safe income to improve the overall income and safety profile of the portfolio.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I would track the Core &amp; Satellite method here, which I discussed in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817645-the-only-retirement-investing-strategy-i-would-trust-with-my-future\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817645-the-only-retirement-investing-strategy-i-would-trust-with-my-future\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. While it’s a bit different from what we are doing here, the strategy is based on building a strong framework of low-cost ETFs and/or stocks and using specific investments to improve the risk/reward of the portfolio through very targeted investments.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, let’s look into the actual picks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The \"Forever\" Dividend Stocks I Would Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you’re one of my more frequent readers, you will see a lot of companies that I bring up from time to time, as this isn’t an article to become creative and simply discuss random stocks for the sake of coverage diversity (I never do that, to be honest).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although every stage of the wealth-building process is key, retiring means being reliant financially on one’s financial assets.

That company is Realty Income (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O\" title=\"Realty Income Corporation\">O</a>), the largest net lease REIT in the United States, with a focus on single-tenant assets occupied by operators in areas that are mostly anti-cyclical and protected against e-commerce disruption.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1666\" data-height=\"932\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Realty Income</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Realty Income may be boring, yet when buying income, that’s great, as it yields 5.4% with more than 30 years of consecutive annual dividend hikes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the dividend, which is paid quarterly (some really like that), has a five-year CAGR of 3.6%.

VICI is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vici_Properties\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vici_Properties\" target=\"_blank\">the result</a> of the Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It resulted in a spin-off of major properties. Later, it also bought its largest peer, MGM Growth Properties, becoming a company that basically owns most iconic buildings on the Las Vegas Strip, where it generates half of its total rent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its assets include Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Caesars Palace, The Venetian Las Vegas, and many others that create the only major REIT with non-commoditized assets.

Many BDCs have been aggressive funders of software operations, which now exposes them to severe AI disruption, as I wrote in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824776-single-biggest-risk-for-bdcs-nobody-is-talking-about\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824776-single-biggest-risk-for-bdcs-nobody-is-talking-about\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. As you can see on page 24 of this investor <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1b8ce2882772fbe3248825d2affa0489/mainstcapital/db/396/10973/pdf/Q2+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1b8ce2882772fbe3248825d2affa0489/mainstcapital/db/396/10973/pdf/Q2+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>, its largest segment is machinery, accounting for 16% of its portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving over to hard asset value, I can keep this super straightforward. Here, I would own the most mission-critical players in infrastructure. This includes energy midstream infrastructure like pipelines and processing assets, large-scale infrastructure like toll roads, ports, power distribution, and even Class I railroads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we exclude MLPs, which we already own in the ETF part of the model portfolio, I would suggest American companies like ONEOK (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE\" title=\"ONEOK, Inc.\">OKE</a>), which has a liquids-focused pipeline footprint in the South, and Antero Midstream (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM\" title=\"Antero Midstream Corporation\">AM</a>), which owns the gathering and processing assets of Antero Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR\" title=\"Antero Resources Corporation\">AR</a>) in Appalachia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OKE yields 6.0% due to a weak oil price. While ONEOK’s business mostly consists of fixed-fee revenue, the stock tends to sell off when oil prices weaken. As it aims for 3-4% long-term dividend growth, this is a huge opportunity, as I expect a lot more demand for pipelines in America’s hottest energy region in the years ahead.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1536\" data-height=\"846\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ONEOK</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833570-my-favorite-2-stock-combo-for-next-decade\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833570-my-favorite-2-stock-combo-for-next-decade\" target=\"_blank\">Antero Midstream</a> yields 5.0%.

I would include it because of its wide-moat footprint in the DIY housing space, which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833229-coiled-spring-betting-on-my-top-picks-for-americas-next-housing-boom\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833229-coiled-spring-betting-on-my-top-picks-for-americas-next-housing-boom\" target=\"_blank\">I expect to benefit</a> from efforts to unlock the housing market, among its brilliant supply chain operations, and bigger push into the <a href=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2025/06-30-2025-130354727\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2025/06-30-2025-130354727\" target=\"_blank\">PRO segment</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, while it’s not cheap, I would include RTX Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>), which has both defense and commercial aerospace exposure. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831529-rtx-my-biggest-defense-investment-just-went-boom\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831529-rtx-my-biggest-defense-investment-just-went-boom\" target=\"_blank\">I think</a> the company will continue to return double digits every year. It now yields 1.5% with a five-year CAGR of 6.9% that I expect to increase due to strong earnings growth and accelerating free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, I would include some AI exposure here. Unfortunately, these are rather expensive right now, which is why I would likely stick to proven companies like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>). It yields just 0.3% but has proven to be able to both stand out in the LLM AI model space and use its massive installed base of billions of daily users to turn its advantage into high earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, what’s the bottom line?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Portfolio Overview &amp; Closing Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now comes another fun thing, which is putting everything together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below, I highlighted all the companies I mentioned. I included their yields and the average weighted yield. For that, I used the weighted yield contribution. You can ignore that, as it’s for calculation purposes only.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that the weighting is 100%. If we combine it with ETFs, that number obviously becomes 50%, and all weightings are cut in half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see, the average yield is 5.5% because the majority of the portfolio is invested in O, VICI, MAIN, OKE, and AM. This means that single stocks heavily compete with the weighting of some major ETFs. It’s not perfect for diversification, but it shows that if we want to include faster-growing stocks, we either need to change the ETF composition or accept that some stocks get a bigger weighting. As I went with ultra-high-quality companies, I am not too worried about this weighting.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1714\" data-height=\"648\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk here is MAIN’s 17% weighting. Because of its cyclical behavior, one could push that down to 10% and distribute 7 points over other higher-yielding stocks or add another pick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, this is just food for thought, not a portfolio I want everyone to copy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, so far, the portfolio has done well. Since January 2021, it has returned 17.8% per year, beating the DVY ETF’s 12.5% annual return by a wide margin. While it has a standard deviation of 16.5%, its worst drawdown since then was 15.5%, better than the 16.0% drawdown of DVY during this period.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1682\" data-height=\"892\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is what the chart looks like:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1682\" data-height=\"1090\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"415\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are obviously many ways to construct a 50/50 portfolio, I think this stock selection can be a great foundation, as it has a great yield, fantastic companies, inflation protection, and what I expect to be a high probability of outperformance versus other dividend-focused ETFs and assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risks here are concentration risks, as we went with a few high-volatility ideas. Also, general risks like recession and market sell-offs apply. Under no circumstances should investors manage a concentrated portfolio if they lack the knowledge required to assess single stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these people, a 100% ETF strategy will work best. And there’s obviously nothing wrong with that.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Needless to say, I look forward to reading your thoughts.</p>",
