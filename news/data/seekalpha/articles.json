With a market capitalization of $6.19 billion as of this writing, and a good track record for growth under<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> its belt, it is certainly an intriguing prospect. On top of this, shares of the business trade on the cheap, and leverage is lower than what we see with most other similar enterprises. Currently, the housing market is undergoing significant stress. And that is something that investors should continue to monitor closely. This is especially true when you consider that firms such as this are finally starting to see some pain from that weakness. But given how cheap shares are, because of its overall financial position, and because my expectation that the long-term picture for the housing industry will eventually improve, I believe that now is actually a great time to upgrade the company from a \"Buy\" to a \"Strong Buy.\"</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Great Play In Housing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentally speaking, things are not going exactly great for shareholders of Taylor Morrison Home Corporation.

In the image above, you can see how the median price of a new home sold has been on the decline for a few years now. This is because of inflationary pressures and high-interest rates aimed at combating them. Unfortunately, because of the government shutdown, we don't have the most up-to-date data here. But <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">we do know</a> that, as of August, of this year, the number of housing completions was 8.4% lower than it was a year earlier. The number of housing starts was down 6%, while building permits were down 11.1%. As I have written about in other articles, such as here and here, I firmly believe that the U.S. economy is barreling toward a recession. So in the short term, I fully expect these conditions to worsen.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2170\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the time lag between when market conditions change and when homebuilders ultimately deliver their homes, we are just now seeing some of the weakness that Taylor Morrison Home Corporation was destined to see.

That's down from the $2.12 billion that the company reported a year earlier. This was driven by a decline in the number of homes closed from 3,394 to 3,324, which more than offset a rise in the average price of a home from $598,000 last year to $602,000 this year. However, for the first nine months of this year in its entirety, the number of homes closed was up, while the average price was down slightly. The chart above illustrates this. And that, clearly, helped to push revenue for the first nine months of this year up compared to the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This recent decrease in sales had a deleterious impact on the company's bottom line. Net income contracted from $251.1 million to $201.4 million. But that's not all. While operating cash flow did skyrocket from $135.9 million to $219.6 million, we saw this metric, adjusted for changes in working capital, fall from $264.7 million to $257 million. Meanwhile, EBITDA for the company contracted from $379.2 million to $333.1 million. Although net profits are down for this year in its entirety, all other cash flow metrics for the company have improved, which means that the problems seen in the most recent quarter are new. In fact, management, while acknowledging broader economic conditions that have delayed the purchase of homes, mentioned that the company has been offering even greater incentives and discounts to drive buying activity.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2014\" data-height=\"872\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1894\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These discounts have been reflected in net new orders for the institution. In the most recent quarter, the company saw net new orders amounting to 2,468 homes. That's down 12.8% from the 2,830 homes ordered a year earlier. At the same time as this occurred, the average price of a home ordered contracted from $587,000 to $567,000. Unlike what we saw in revenue, this is not a new trend. In fact, as the chart above illustrates, net new orders and average prices for new homes ordered have both contracted year over year for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time of 2024. The company is also seeing a rise in its cancellation rate, with an increase from 9.3% in the third quarter of last year to 15.4% this year. This is evidence that the buyers of its homes are becoming increasingly pressured by difficult market conditions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2058\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see the impact that prior large home deliveries, and weaker net new orders, have had on the company's backlog. The number of homes in its backlog came in at only 3,605 homes in the third quarter of this year. That's an astounding decline of 36.7% compared to the 5,692 homes in backlog a year earlier. And at the same time, as the company has pushed out more of the higher-priced homes and brought in more of the lower-priced ones, the average price of a home in backlog dropped from $673,000 to $648,000.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1776\" data-height=\"870\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes it difficult to know what the future holds. If we do project out based on the results that we have seen already for this year, we would get net profits of about $838.6 million, adjusted operating cash flow of $1.09 billion, and EBITDA of $1.40 billion. With these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently valued. Obviously, this does not capture the prospect of additional weakening in the market. But considering how cheap the stock is, even with the picture worsening, shares could still be quite appealing. This is true not only on an absolute basis, but relative to other similar firms as well. In the table below, I stacked Taylor Morrison Home Corporation up against five other similar enterprises. On a price-to-earnings basis, two of the firms are cheaper than it is, while another is tied with it. But when it comes to the other two valuation approaches, our prospect is the cheapest of the group.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company</strong></td> <td><strong>Price / Earnings</strong></td> <td><strong>Price / Operating Cash Flow</strong></td> <td><strong>EV / EBITDA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Taylor Morrison Home Corporation</strong></td> <td><strong>7.4</strong></td> <td><strong>5.7</strong></td> <td><strong>5.7</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Hovnanian Enterprises (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOV\" title=\"Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.\">HOV</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>6.3</strong></td> <td><strong>6.4</strong></td> <td><strong>8.1</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Meritage Homes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTH\" title=\"Meritage Homes Corporation\">MTH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>6.2</strong></td> <td><strong>19.1</strong></td> <td><strong>7.5</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Century Communities (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCS\" title=\"Century Communities, Inc.\">CCS</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>7.4</strong></td> <td><strong>13.1</strong></td> <td><strong>11.9</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Beazer Homes USA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BZH\" title=\"Beazer Homes USA, Inc.\">BZH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>10.7</strong></td> <td><strong>25.9</strong></td> <td><strong>20.1</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>KB Home (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBH\" title=\"KB Home\">KBH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>8.8</strong></td> <td><strong>11.4</strong></td> <td><strong>8.5</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another advantage that Taylor Morrison Home Corporation has over most of its competitors is leverage. The firm has net debt of only $1.82 billion right now. In the chart below, you can see that this translates to a net leverage ratio of 1.30. That's below four of the five institutions that I stacked it up against. In fact, I would argue that it is substantially lower than these other four players. That provides the company additional flexibility and optionality, especially in a down market. So I don't have any concern about the long-term viability of the business.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1910\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Net Debt / EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"303\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short run, I do remain concerned about market conditions. According to one <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500367-ubs-u-s-lumber-tariffs-could-add-8900-to-cost-of-building-a-home\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500367-ubs-u-s-lumber-tariffs-could-add-8900-to-cost-of-building-a-home\" target=\"_blank\">source</a>, the newest tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will raise the cost of the average home by $8,900. And that does not even factor in any potential ramifications from the newest 10% tariff imposed on Canada by the U<span>nited States</span>. Considering that Canada <a href=\"https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2025/01/us-lumber-market-trump-administration/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%2028.1%20million,growing%20and%20conserving%20our%20forests.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2025/01/us-lumber-market-trump-administration/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%2028.1%20million,growing%20and%20conserving%20our%20forests.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">supplies</a> about 24% of US softwood lumber consumption for the United States, and that this works out to as much as 85% of all U.S. softwood lumber imports, we could have additional costs stemming from this decision. But the good news is that, earlier this year, <strong>Zillow</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Z\" title=\"Zillow Group, Inc.\">Z</a>) <a href=\"https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-housing-shortage-hits-record-high-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-housing-shortage-hits-record-high-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> that there exists a housing deficit of 4.7 million homes nationwide. This is actually a record high despite a five-year construction boom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For several years now, the U<span>nited States</span> has been underbuilding. So even with a surge of construction activity, the preexisting shortage and a continued growth of the U.S. population caused this shortage to balloon. At some point, the combination of additional population growth and some of the 8.1 million families that are now sharing homes with non-relatives, will eventually hit a breaking point and push buying activity up, but perhaps only after a recession and a big decline in interest rates. When that does happen, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation will be in a prime position to benefit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data currently available, I still believe that while market conditions could worsen in the near term, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation is in a good spot. The firm is cheap, and the overall risk profile of it is low. When you consider long-term trends, this bodes well for shareholders. So at the end of the day, I firmly believe that increasing my rating from a \"Buy\" to a \"Strong Buy\" makes sense.</p>",

This followed the divestment of non-core business activities in the years before. Ever since, shares have lost about 30% in the time<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> frame of a quarter, while the market at large has been trading fairly stable.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has certainly improved appeal, as the company announced an interesting acquisition as well. Right now, valuations have been compressed quite a bit, but still mark a substantial premium to the overall market, although that I am inclined to buy the dip below the $200 mark.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data Analytics Play</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk is a provider of key data analytics functions in the global insurance industry, which in itself includes various segments like life &amp; annuity, auto, property, casualty, weather events, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its role is that of strategic data analytics and technology partner in order to provide insights to its client base, which use such data for underwriting and claims. These insights allow them to make more informed decisions, which is key given the amounts involved with such underwriting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk generates about $3 billion in sales from providing such services with EBITDA margins exceeding 50% of sales, an impressive result for a completely focused business with retention rates close to 100%. Some 70% of its sales are generated by underwriting solutions, with the remainder of revenues coming from claim solutions. In all, some 80% of sales are generated in North America, with the remainder of revenues generated abroad.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Becoming A Focused Business</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Up to a couple of years ago, the company has a smaller energy segment and financial service industry activity as well, yet it has divested these assets in recent years. The completely focused business posted a 7% increase in sales, both in 2023 and 2024, with revenues last year reported up to nearly $2.9 billion. The company reported EBITDA near $1.6 billion, translating into truly remarkable margins, with adjusted earnings reported at $6.64 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the year 2025, the company initially saw sales up to a midpoint of $3.05 billion, with adjusted earnings seen a couple pennies short of the $7 per share mark. Trading at $303 in July, as the company was awarded a $45 billion enterprise valuation, equal to 15 times sales, valuing equity at a mid-forty times earnings multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That was not about to change following a $162 million bolt-on deal announced for SuranceBay over the summer, and while the performance of the business was impressive, an earnings yield in the low 2s was simply too low to see appeal.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coming Down</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the summer, share of Verisk have seen quite a setback, now trading down 20% to $208 per share, levels first seen in the summer of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fall started by the end of July, when the company announced both second quarter <a href=\"https://investor.verisk.com/News--Events-/Press-Releases--Market-Info/news-details/2025/Verisk-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a>, and announced a substantial acquisition. Second quarter sales were up 8% in a steady fashion to $773 million. The company hiked the midpoint of the sales guidance to $3.11 billion, aided by a weaker dollar, but at the same time trimmed the full year earnings guidance by five cents to a midpoint of $6.90 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt stood at $2.6 billion as 140 million shares outstanding make for a $34.0 billion equity valuation and $36.6 billion enterprise valuation. This reduces sales multiples to about 12 times, with earnings trading at a 35 times multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, Verisk announced a substantial $2.35 billion <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/767340216/files/doc_presentations/2025/Sep/Verisk-Announces-the-Acquisitions-of-AccuLynx-and-SuranceBay.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">purchase</a> of AccuLynx, with the company being a leading SAAS platform which provides end-to-end management workflows for residential property contractors. The company really focuses on all information in such projects, while providing key links between insurers, contractors, suppliers and third party administrators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The purchase does not come cheap. The company, which has been founded in 2018, generates about $150 million in annual sales. This suggests that a premium 15 times sales multiple has been paid, although that its sales are seen up mid-to double-digits. The 55% EBITDA margins are in line with margins reported by Verisk itself. This will double net debt essentially to $5 billion, still manageable, for a net leverage ratio in the mid to-higher 2s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors gotten a bit spooked as shares fell by another 10% towards the end of October, when Verisk <a href=\"https://investor.verisk.com/News--Events-/Press-Releases--Market-Info/news-details/2025/Verisk-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a ¨mere¨ 5.5% increase in organic constant currency sales for the third quarter. Worse, slower growth came amidst margin pressure as well, with adjusted earnings up just 3% to $1.72 per share. While the company maintains its full year $6.80-$7.00 adjusted earnings per share outlook, the full year sales outlook has been trimmed by $40-$50 million here, trending closer to the original outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This continued fall in the share price made that earnings multiples compressed further to 30 times, which is a lot more compelling than this summer, but still rather demanding.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the deal for AccuLynx taking place at a substantial premium, it is easy to become a bit more cautious, also as organic growth is slowing down. High valuations and a subsequent 30% pullback have reduced earnings multiples from the mid-forties to thirty times. This has pushed up the earnings yield from a low 2% to the low 3s%, which is compelling, but still demanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk is a very strong business, one which I have great admiration for, as the move has certainly improved appeal a great deal. The question is if current multiples in the low-thirties are compelling enough, now also given the leveraged up balance sheet, as frankly I need a bigger margin of safety here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I am watching this development unfold with great interest, looking to get involved at levels towards below $200 mark. I fully recognize the risk that I might not see such levels as the market rightfully awards premium multiple to a premium business for a long time already, with the risk-reward gradually becoming more balanced here.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTSR\" title=\"Metsera, Inc.\">MTSR</a></span>) finds itself in an all-out bidding war between an established obesity treatment giant, Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>), and a contender in Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>).</p> <p>Metsera IPO’d earlier this year. The company is advancing<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a </span><a href=\"https://metsera.com/pipeline/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">pipeline</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of “next-generation Nutrient Stimulated Hormone targets.”</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its lead program, MET-097i (inj.), is a fully-biased, ultra-long-acting GLP-1 RA that aims for once-monthly administration with no titration regimen (Phase 2). Metsera is also testing MET-097i with MET-233i (inj.), an ultra-long-acting amylin analog, in a Phase 1 trial. Beyond injectables, Metsera boasts ultra-long-acting oral GLP-1 peptides that aim for injectable-like efficacy at lower doses to curtail manufacturing and scaling hurdles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to its investigational assets, Metsera is grounded on its <a href=\"https://metsera.com/science/\" rel=\"nofollow\">platform</a>: HALO (lipidation), MOMENTUM (oral delivery), and MINT (a library of 20,000 NuSH analogs from two decades of work).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it’s easy to see why big pharmaceutical companies are, figuratively speaking, fighting over it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It all started when Metsera signed a <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-acquire-metsera-and-its-next-generation-obesity\" rel=\"nofollow\">deal</a> with Pfizer on September 22, 2025, for $47.50 cash plus $22.50 CVR (up to ~$7.3 billion). Earlier today, Novo Nordisk launched an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-makes-unsolicited-offer-metsera-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">unsolicited bid</a> valuing Metsera up to ~$9 billion. Immediately following, Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-addresses-proposal-metsera\" rel=\"nofollow\">fired back</a>, calling Novo Nordisk’s bid “unprecedented,” “reckless,” and “in violation of law.” Metsera then <a href=\"https://investors.metsera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/metsera-receives-unsolicited-proposal-novo-nordisk\" rel=\"nofollow\">declared</a> Novo Nordisk’s proposal as “superior.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the hoopla, Metsera’s stock climbed ~20% to ~$63.50 (intraday).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The article that follows takes a closer look at the developments and uncovers what’s ahead for Metsera investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's In It For Metsera</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, let’s begin by laying out the two deals side-by-side.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table class=\"table-striped\"> <thead><tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>Item</p></td> <td><p>Pfizer (signed merger)</p></td> <td><p>Novo Nordisk (unsolicited; deemed “Superior”)</p></td> </tr></thead> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Headline value (max)</p></td> <td><p>Up to $70.00/share</p></td> <td><p>Up to $77.75/share</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Up-front cash to holders</p></td> <td><p>$47.50/share at closing</p></td> <td><p>Two-step: NVO pays $56.50/share to MTSR; MTSR issues NVO 50% non-voting preferred; same day, MTSR declares a $56.50/share cash dividend, paid ~10 days later</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Contingent value right (CVR)</p></td> <td><p>Up to $22.50/share tied to specified dev./approval milestones</p></td> <td><p>Up to $21.25/share CVR with milestones “substantially similar” to Pfizer CVR</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Board stance</p></td> <td><p>The board still recommends approving the Pfizer merger</p></td> <td><p>The board has delivered a “Superior Proposal” notice to Pfizer</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Match/negotiation window</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>4 business days for Pfizer to negotiate terms so Novo no longer “Superior,” although Pfizer believes Metsera had no right to deliver “Superior” notice</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this context, Metsera’s current price of ~$63.50 is a risk-adjusted, time-discounted price across scenarios. The three most likely scenarios are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Pfizer ups/matches and wins (60-70% likely).</p></li> <li><p>Novo signs and ultimately pays up to $77.75 (25-35%).</p></li> <li><p>Break (≤5%).</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is Metsera’s stock 20% higher today? For starters, the max consideration rose ~11%. Moreover, a real rival bid and “Superior” designation increase the probability that some deal closes. Lastly, there’s now credible overbid/match potential from Pfizer. Essentially, the market is pricing in a modestly sweetened deal by Pfizer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While existing Metsera investors are “sitting pretty,” I don’t see much opportunity for “arbitrage” for prospective investors, especially as the process may drag (Pfizer disputes “Superior” notice; Novo Nordisk faces higher antitrust scrutiny).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Metsera appears structurally incentivized to close with Pfizer. The signed Pfizer agreement is still the governing deal; there may be a credible litigation threat if Metsera pivots to Novo Nordisk, and there is antitrust asymmetry (Novo Nordisk’s obesity dominance with Wegovy). Also, don’t underestimate the weight Boards give to speed and certainty of closure. So, this may not be the case of “highest bidder wins.”</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's In It For Pfizer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acquisition would reignite Pfizer’s obesity pipeline, which is noticeably barren following the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791178-pfizers-oral-obesity-drug-flop-a-symptom-of-a-deeper-pipeline-problem\">danuglipron failure</a>. Given the massive size of the obesity treatment market (near-term estimates are as high as $100 billion), Pfizer is almost obligated to pay up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Novo Nordisk’s bid follows <a href=\"https://investors.metsera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/metsera-reports-positive-phase-2b-results-first-and-best-class\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phase 2b data</a> for Metsera’s MET-097i (monthly), released just days after the Pfizer deal.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>As a fully biased mono-agonist, MET-097i achieved dual-agonist-like weight loss of 14.1% at 28 weeks in VESPER-1, with only 2.9% study discontinuation. In VESPER-3, with two titration steps to the highest dose evaluated, we saw potentially class-leading tolerability with a placebo-like frequency of diarrhea, and a risk difference from placebo of 13% for nausea, and 11% for vomiting. Based on these data, MET-097i is advancing into Phase 3 clinical trials, accelerating its development as the foundational peptide for Metsera’s combination, oral, and prodrug programs.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For context, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy (weekly) inspired ~14.9% mean weight loss at 68 weeks (<a href=\"https://www.novomedlink.com/content/dam/wegovy/pdf/patient-clinical-support.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">STEP-1</a>) with discontinuation for AEs at 6.8%. Eli Lilly’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) Zepbound caused ~20-21% mean weight loss at 72 weeks (<a href=\"https://zepbound.lilly.com/hcp/clinical-data-weight\" rel=\"nofollow\">SURMOUNT-1</a>; H2H vs. Wegovy also <a href=\"https://www.lilly.com/en-CA/news/press-releases/2024.12.4-tirzepatide-surmount-5-h2h\" rel=\"nofollow\">superior</a>) with discontinuation AEs ~6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, both Wegovy and Zepbound require once-weekly dosing with multistep titration to mitigate GI AEs. MET-097i is dosed monthly with an encouraging GI AE profile. Should MET-097i confer Wegovy-like efficacy (possibly greater) and low discontinuation in Phase 3, it could have a clear path towards becoming an obesity blockbuster.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's In It For Novo Nordisk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Novo Nordisk’s interest signals that it is bracing for margin/price pressure in the GLP-1 world. Wegovy will not be a blockbuster forever. The onus in biopharma is the need for continuous innovation. Acquiring Metsera delivers a clean, vertically integrated “next-gen” pipeline (amylin/GLP-1 combos) to renew its leadership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, Novo Nordisk’s <a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/science-and-technology/r-d-pipeline.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">obesity pipeline</a> is already dense. However, Metsera now has a late-stage, titration-light, GLP-1 backbone. Moreover, Novo’s combo approach is weekly (CagriSema; amycretin weekly and oral). Whereas, Metsera’s co-formulated GLP-1 + amylin is dosed monthly. Lastly, Metsera’s MOMENTUM platform addresses the API/COGS bottleneck that Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide (approval pending in obesity) will certainly suffer from.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To wrap up, Novo Nordisk’s unsolicited bid for Metsera adds both uncertainty and further upside potential for the latter’s shareholders. However, this is already priced in, so any arbitrage potential appears muted. As such, Metsera investors will benefit from staying put until this works itself out (“Hold” rating).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Pfizer, its press release today, in my view, reeks of desperation. It should remain focused on closing the deal, rather than publicly antagonizing its target. Obviously, both sides (Metsera &amp; Pfizer) are saying different things about what is and isn’t allowed (in terms of other deals). Without the details on my desk, I can only speculate. What I do know is that Pfizer needs Metsera more than anyone else.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clearly, Novo Nordisk also needs Metsera. Although Wegovy remains a monster in its own right, it is slowly losing ground to Zepbound, and the obesity treatment market in just 3–4 years from now will be very different. To put it simply, Novo Nordisk is at risk of losing its stronghold in obesity, which is why its stock trades the way it does (-55% in the past year).</p>",

Corp. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFC\" title=\"V.F. Corporation\">VFC</a></span>) is now two years into a turnaround under CEO Bracken Darrell. I've been long the stock for much of this time, and have written bullish articles on SA in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680202-vf-corp-is-hitting-peak-pessimism\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">March 2024</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4770467-vf-corp-oversold-after-sector-sell-off\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">March 2025</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, arguing that the market has been too impatient with management's strategy. After another several quarters of operating results in 2025, I'm writing with an update in which I will put this week's results in a slightly longer perspective, and to explain why I have decided to throw in the towel and sell my shares.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think bulls and bears are both only capturing part of the story here. VF's turnaround is working, especially on the operational side (turning around the trajectory of Vans is proving harder than expected), but a combination of inherent difficulties and tariffs is going to mean that the turnaround will take longer than initially expected. Hence, my question: how long are you willing to wait? </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><strong>Recent Financials</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last four quarters, VF management has made measurable progress on improving the company's financial profile. They quickly achieved the first $300 million in cost savings and announced another $500-$600 million more over the next three years. Gross margins have stabilized and operating margins have improved significantly. Meanwhile, the sales of Supreme and now, more recently, Dickie's have brought down debt by almost 50% from $5.7 billion when Darrell began to probably around $2.9 billion after the Dickie's sale is completed. This has not yet led to any sustained drop in interest expenses, but it is definitely a move in the right direction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4b33ce4b70760f2421d213077dfeea89/vfc/db/409/134231/transcript/CORRECTED+TRANSCRIPT_+VF+Corp.%28VFC-US%29%2C+Q2+2026+Earnings+Call%2C+28-October-2025+8_00+AM+ET.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest quarter's call</a>, management explained that if they exclude Dickie's, about 70% of the company's brands by revenue are now growing. That is great news, and speaks to the real strength of North Face and Timberland especially. But Vans, the largest brand, continues to suffer. Over the last four quarters, Vans revenue has post YOY drops of -8%, -20%, -15%, and -11%, respectively. Especially in the middle two quarters, management attributed a big part of the drop to store closures in North America. They have basically said that, excluding their own deliberate rebalancing, the drops have been stable in the high single digits. I don't take this as necessarily a negative sign, but it offers us no real evidence of progress on the turnaround.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the earnings calls, Darrell remains exceptionally optimistic and positive about the behind-the-scenes changes going on within the management of VF's brands, especially Vans. The company has been trying to \"premiumize\" the brand more, and has gotten positive feedback on their Warped Tour and Instagram marketing campaigns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But compared with the report in 2024 that SEO results were really improving in Europe, these comments are much less quantitatively solid and rigorous. I remain generally confident that Darrell's turnaround plan makes sense and will work over time, but the tough reality is that Vans is still losing customers. Management has shifted from providing some hard - if small - evidence of improvement in 2024 to saying that \"turnarounds take time\" in 2025. In other words, they are no longer providing a clear timeline for the Vans turnaround. Instead, we hear that the CEO is \"super confident\" that Vans will return to growth (on the Q2 call this week) but also that \"I'm going to keep the expectations low for Vans as long as possible, because I want to give her plenty of room to operate\" (<a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4b33ce4b70760f2421d213077dfeea89/vfc/db/409/127906/transcript/CORRECTED+TRANSCRIPT_+VF+Corp.%28VFC-US%29%2C+Q3+2025+Earnings+Call%2C+29-January-2025+8_00+AM+ET.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY25 Q3 call in January</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I appreciate the optimism and think Darrell's team is being reasonable in moderating expectations and working on the actual business, but investors need to plan accordingly. At this point, there is little reason to expect strong revenue growth in 2026. Consensus estimates are for 1% YOY growth for FY26 (ending in March 2027). That seems conservative to me, but I also see little evidence to support more bullishness. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has put on a good face about tariffs, emphasizing their mitigation strategies and diverse sourcing across Southeast Asia and Latin America, but the reality is that they project the tariffs to cost them about $250-$270 million, mostly in 2026, a figure which they have revised upwards from an initial estimate of $150 million. This is made worse by the fact that the brands have (it seems) very little pricing power. As management explained on the <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4b33ce4b70760f2421d213077dfeea89/vfc/db/409/132965/transcript/CORRECTED+TRANSCRIPT_+VF+Corp.%28VFC-US%29%2C+Q1+2026+Earnings+Call%2C+30-July-2025+8_00+AM+ET.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q1 call in July</a>, VF's products have an overall price elasticity of about one, meaning that any increase in prices that they pass on to consumers will be met with a proportional drop in sales volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, with the business only generating about $400 million in OCF per year over the last two years, this net increase in costs is going to make it much harder to pay down debt, etc. Remember that VF Corp is still paying out about $140 million per year in dividends. So, the tariff costs are going to eat up most of the other cash that the business might have generated to pay down debt and fuel growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock nosedived this spring when the tariffs were announced, from a recent high of $28 all the way down to below $10. Since then, they have of course recovered along with the broader market. But make no mistake, the tariffs are bad news, made worse by VF's limited cash generation ability and high debt burden. I don't see the tariffs going away anytime soon, and so investors need to accordingly moderate their expectations about the speed of the turnaround.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Outlook for Shares</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the wake of this week's earnings report, as shares slide over 10%, analysts updated their forecasts and price targets. The three most highly-rated analysts according to TipRanks are in perfect disagreement:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Sam Poser (Williams Trading): SELL, price target $10</li> <li>Adrienne Yih (Barclays): BUY, price target $18</li> <li><p>John Kernan (TD Cowen): HOLD, price target $15</p></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the monthly chart below, We can see how those targets match up with recent price action. Shares have seen very strong support (and insider buying) between $9 and $12, but they've failed to reliably break out about $20 or so. Perhaps the gradual upwards trend of the last few months will be sustained despite the recent sell-off, but I don't see a strong fundamental reason for it at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1108\" data-height=\"594\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/596900-17617475207431955_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TC2000</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I remain impressed with the optimism, energy, and successes of VF Corp's turnaround effort. But over the last nine months, there have been two major new headwinds: tariffs and stalling progress at Vans. Over the medium term (say 3-5 years) I remain optimistic about management's ability to revitalize Timberlands, North Face, and Vans, and to stabilize revenue and profitability.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But with shares already trading at over 20x 2026 earnings - a valuation about 20% <em>above </em>the industry average - I think a significant portion of that medium-term improvement is already priced in. In the shorter-term, tariffs, dividends, and revenue declines are going to limit FCF and leave the company's debt levels stubbornly high. It turns out that, as many writers have noted, turnarounds are longer and slower than people usually hope.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CZR\" title=\"Caesars Entertainment, Inc.\">CZR</a></span>) in late July, I thought Caesars' stock looked intriguing. Beneath the headlines, Q2 numbers looked better than the market — which sent CZR on an eleven-session losing streak into<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and out of the report — seemed to believe. And while leverage and the general underperformance of these \"value play or value trap\" consumer names suggested there was little need to rush in, it did seem like shares were worth at least a long look.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third quarter results this week have met with another negative reaction: CZR dropped more than 15% on Wednesday. As with Q2, the headlines seem to support a sell-off. Margins <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509737-caesars-entertainment-gaap-eps-of-0_27-misses-by-0_18-revenue-of-2_87b-misses-by-20m\">clearly disappointed</a> relative to sell-side expectations; headline numbers are notably soft, including an 11% decline in same-store Adjusted EBITDA. This time around, however, a closer look doesn't suggest a report that quietly helps the bull case, but rather one that loudly supports the bear case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Case For CZR Stock After Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's worth noting up front that this is not a stock where valuation moves change the thesis <em>that</em> much. Capitalizing leases at 8x rent expense, Caesars's market cap is about one-sixth of its enterprise value. The 15% decline in the stock price equates to a roughly 3% fall in EV. Similarly, the multiple assigned here hasn't changed all that much; at least on paper, the shortfall in Q3 EBITDA (probably $40-$50 million relative to consensus as well as my own broad expectations for a low-single-digit/mid-single-digit decline) accounts for close to half today's movement. CZR's EV/EBITDA multiple on Wednesday is about one-tenth of a turn lower than it was at Tuesday's close.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so it's difficult — I would argue dangerous — to make the case that CZR is simply \"too cheap\". The lease-adjusted enterprise value here still is over $25 billion; a ~7x EV/EBITDA multiple is not <em>that</em> great for a leveraged cyclical facing very real risks. Instead, the bull case here needs to at least some degree be based on the underlying business, and at the moment likely on the argument that the market is overreacting to Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's an argument that can be reasonably made. The external environment was not kind to Caesars in the quarter. Visitation to Las Vegas is down amid macroeconomic uncertainty and fewer international arrivals. (As chief executive officer Tom Reeg has noted in recent quarters, the flow of guests from Canada in particular has dried up). Hold both in Las Vegas table games and in the Caesars Digital business was well below expectations: accounting for better-than-usual hold in Q3 2024, luck alone hit year-over-year EBITDA by $61 million, more than half the reported decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet there were some bright spots. Regional revenue rose more than 6% year-over-year. That's both good news for the segment and adds some support to the idea that problems in Vegas are due to the market rather than execution. Caesars Digital profits look awful — EBITDA of $28 million against $52 million the year before — but normalized for hold and the year-prior sale of the World Series of Poker earnings actually rose modestly. Sports betting handle rose 6.4% year-over-year, after a first-half decline management attributed to lower marketing spend; hold there is not a Caesars-specific problem, as favorites <a href=\"https://www.covers.com/sport/football/nfl/league-trends/seasontodate\" rel=\"nofollow\">have notably outperformed</a> early in the National Football League season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so it is fair to ask what, exactly, changes with the bull case coming out of the quarter. This is still a strong land-based business, albeit one facing short-term turbulence in Vegas. On the Q3 call, Reeg said of the digital business that \"all of our goals remain in front of us in terms of what we've laid out for digital and [we] fully<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834363-caesars-entertainment-inc-czr-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> expect that we'll get there</a>\". In August, I noted that at least on paper, an investor could argue that if those targets (including $500 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA) were hit, Caesars Digital would be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815059-caesars-entertainment-stock-getting-closer-to-a-buy\">worth about $10 billion</a>. Right now, Caesars' market cap sits at roughly $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even setting aside the potential for a spin and/or assuming Caesars disappoints, consolidated valuation looks at worst reasonable. 7x-plus is a discount to other brick-and-mortar players. Capital expenditures should come down in the next couple of years; Reeg has cited a $1 billion free cash flow target, but even assuming the company falls short the stock is still trading at maybe 5x-6x FCF. That's after the stock has been more than halved in twelve months to reach a five-year low, a decline that, from one perspective seems driven more by noise around tariffs, geopolitics, inflation, and even <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500235-draftkings-and-flutter-slide-after-kalshi-stuns-the-sports-betting-sector-with-huge-trading-volume\">prediction markets</a> than anything clearly, structurally, wrong with the underlying business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, Reeg himself made a version of this case on the Q3 call, focusing on results on the Vegas Strip in particular:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>[Q3] was undeniably soft versus last year, and we're glad to see it coming back in the fourth quarter. It doesn't take a lot to turn that back the other way. You're talking about 5 percentage points of occupancy got us to a 10% decline in adjusted EBITDA.</p> <p>You don't need much to swing back the other way to where you're right back to where you were before. So -- and one more point, we're talking about a quarter where we did about $400 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, so the summer in Vegas. That quarter typically pre-merger was $300 million to $320 million of EBITDA.</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Normalization Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, the bull case here is essentially that Caesars' stock is priced as if the underlying business is going to decline. But Q3 is worrisome precisely because it adds support to that prediction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reeg's quote above highlights one of the key risks around CZR at the moment (and indeed for a couple of years now): that the business recently has been overearning. It is easy for the CEO to say, \"well, we'll just get the five points back\". But Strip occupancy in Q3 was still 91.6%. For legacy Caesars (it was Eldorado Resorts, where Reeg was named CEO at the beginning of 2019, that acquired Caesars and took the target's name), Strip occupancy was <a href=\"https://investor.caesars.com/news-releases/news-release-details/caesars-entertainment-reports-financial-results-third-quarter-4#:~:text=Third%20Quarter%20Highlights&amp;text=Net%20loss%20attributable%20to%20Caesars,increased%205.8%25%20to%20%24635%20million%20.\" rel=\"nofollow\">95.6% in 2019</a> and 92.6% the year before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that context, it's not as if the external environment is horrible; in fact, the Q3 2025 print above 91% seems much closer to mid-cycle levels (at least based on 2010s performance) than does the 97% posted in the year-prior quarter. In other words, Q3 2025 looks much more like a mid-cycle print than one buffeted by external, temporary headwinds. That's particularly true because margins remain elevated, at 39.8% this quarter against mid-30s prints before the pandemic (and over 44% in Q3 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same worry holds in the regional business. Top-line performance was solid: as noted, revenue was up more than 6%, while table drop was +16% and slot handle +9%. But here, too, margins are a concern: margins dropped 150 basis points, and Adjusted EBITDA increased just 1.6%. That's with contributions from the new property in Virginia and a massive renovation and rebranding in New Orleans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caesars also has ramped promotional spend, and while Reeg insisted the company wouldn't get into a \"promotional war\", here, too, there's a worry that margins and profits are likely to return toward pre-pandemic levels as acquisition spending normalizes. That trend would still imply significant compression from 2025 levels (though it's harder to parse exact margins, on a blended basis the merged companies seem to have been in the high 20s, 300-400 bps below the current print).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Terrible Quarter For Digital</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The margin compression is concerning but not terribly surprising. The results from digital, however, do look like a surprise — and hardly a pleasant one. Even accounting for hold, a ~2.5% increase in EBITDA in the quarter is nowhere near good enough. Reeg has been talking for a few quarters about the benefit from sponsorships that are rolling off; that was largely a 2026 boost but there should have been some boost in the quarter. Here, too, marketing spend is up, and yet at least in state-level figures there's no sign that Caesars has <a href=\"https://www.casinoreports.com/us-sports-betting-market-stats-database/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gained any share</a> in sports betting. iGaming handle did jump 24%, but even growth there decelerated from first-half levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the day, $42 million in hold-normalized EBITDA simply isn't good enough, or close. Reeg is reiterating past targets — including a $500 million annual bogey for the business—but it's hard to see how Caesars gets there without significant state-level expansion of iGaming. Sports betting share is simply too low, and organic growth in iGaming no doubt will continue to slow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the catch here is that Digital ostensibly should have a much higher valuation than the legacy brick-and-mortar business. So lower expectations have a material impact on overall valuation. That's doubly true given the still-running debate over whether online revenues 'cannibalize' legacy options, a debate that has received some extra juice amid the furor over prediction market growth. (For what it's worth, from here the argument that the likes of Kalshi will take material share seems overwrought for now, but it clearly has some purchase in the market at the moment).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Change At The Top?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market's reaction to the quarter simply doesn't seem like an overreaction. The blue-sky bull case for CZR was that the legacy business would stabilize at margins still above pre-pandemic levels, while the digital business grew into a multi-billion-dollar valuation. Both sides of that case took a hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet there doesn't seem to be much urgency from Reeg and management, even with the stock at a five-year low. Instead, there is a lot of discussion about what is going on outside the business. Indeed, toward the beginning of Reeg's prepared remarks, the CEO noted that the quarter took a hit of \"a little over $10 million of one-time items that benefited us last year and didn't repeat\". That seems to add some context to the profit decline in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem is that if you go back a year, Reeg opened his prepared remarks by noting that in Q3 2024 there were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730691-caesars-entertainment-inc-czr-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">$10 million</a> in one-time <em>expenses</em> that weren't added back to Adjusted EBITDA. This is becoming a constant pattern: earnings are going in the wrong direction, the stock has been halved in twelve months, and yet per Reeg, everything is fine. That in turn raises serious doubts about Reeg's insistence that digital targets are on track. So does the fact that three quarters ago, Reeg was musing about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761956-caesars-entertainment-inc-czr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">reaching $1 billion</a> in free cash flow this year; the figure through three quarters is $350 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that Q3 suggests a business facing serious challenges both in brick-and-mortar and digital, confidence in management is paramount. And at this point, it's difficult to have that confidence. As I've written before, Reeg was instrumental in the hugely impressive roll-up that Eldorado executed over the last decade. But more recently, it's been a very different story: Caesars' stock is now down 48% since the beginning of 2019. (The S&amp;P 500, including dividends, has tripled).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with Q3, there are explanations for that underperformance and reasons to believe that the trend will eventually turn. But that's been the case for some time now, and the trend hasn't turned. It does seem like big changes may well be needed — but it's hard to bet on those changes happening when Caesars' management continues to act as if nothing is really wrong.</p>",

Operating margins expanded by 390bps to 28.6%, and that drove income up 10% to $361 million. As you can see below, its health sub-segment is leading the way. Managing higher health costs and managing plans, especially with increased demand for GLP-1 drugs, have been significant demand drivers, and I view much of this support as being secular.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A purple and white chart with text AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"520\" height=\"236\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771016403.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Willis Towers Watson</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, rising markets continue to lift wealth revenue, and there was a nice uptick from last year. Wealth is the biggest segment in this unit, and WTW provides consulting and outsourced CIO services, particularly to retirement and pension plans. Rising markets can lift AUM levels, which in turn increases its consulting fee. Trump Administration proposals to allow more private investments into 401k accounts are likely to spur additional consulting work, as plan sponsors (who have a fiduciary responsibility to participants) are likely to use outside consultants to determine what type and how much private investment products to offer. This demand will take time to ramp up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given a lagging jobs market, I am not surprised to see career and BD&amp;O growth slowing. With employment growth slowing and hiring activity fairly muted, I expect career growth to be in the 0%-3% range. I would note that some survey activity was shifted from Q3 to Q4, which may provide a sequential boost to revenue. Still, I view the trajectory into 2026 as one that is slowing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">R&amp;B Delivers Despite Slowing Premium Inflation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, its Risk &amp; Broking business grew organic revenue by 6% to $1 billion, and margins expanded by 70bps to 18.8%, driving an 11% growth in income to $189 million. While its revenue is similar to HWC's, profits in this segment are about half, reflecting lower operating margins. As has been the trend for much of this year, all of its revenue growth is coming from CRB while its technology consulting platform struggles. ICT is just a small part of the unit (about 10% of revenue), so all else equal, we’d rather see the growth slowdown here. Still, given the focus on AI and cybersecurity, one would expect a clearer tailwind for ICT work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A purple and white chart with text AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"545\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771101359.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Willis Towers Watson</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it appears that insurers, like other businesses, are closely managing their consulting and third-party project spending given economic uncertainty and potential margin pressures. Improved business confidence could help accelerate spending here, and there are likely deferred projects by insurers that will eventually go forward. Still, I do not see revenue accelerating meaningfully.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view the 6% growth in CRB as encouraging, given the macro environment. One phenomenon I have discussed before is that insurance premium inflation is slowing. WTW, of course, does not take insurance underwriting risk itself, so it is immune to any margin pressure insurers face due to slowing premiums. However, in its broking business, WTW collects a commission that is typically a piece of the premium. When premium inflation was surging, this created a natural tailwind to WTW’s own revenue growth. With premium inflation down to 3%, that would likely decelerate WTW’s revenue growth in this segment, all else being equal.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1096\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph showing a line going up AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761832771143635_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>St. Louis Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet Enables Buybacks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Willis Towers also maintains a solid balance sheet. It has $1.9 billion in cash and $5.3 billion in debt, both essentially flat year-to-date. That leaves the company with 2x leverage and solid investment-grade credit ratings. With leverage here, WTW can return all free cash flow to its investors. So far this year, it has generated $838 million of free cash flow. I would remind investors that the company’s free cash flow is typically heavily H2-weighted, given the timing of working capital movements. Given seasonal patterns, I would expect at least $600 million of Q4 free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key part of any bull thesis around Willis Towers is its strong capital returns. The company pays a 1.2% dividend, but buybacks are the primary focus of its capital allocation policy. Back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4496344-wtw-increases-share-repurchase-program-by-1_5-billion\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4496344-wtw-increases-share-repurchase-program-by-1_5-billion\" target=\"_blank\">September</a>, WTW added $1.5 billion to its buyback authorization, which had dwindled to just $200 million. There is no timeline for when the program will be completed, but I expect it to cover ~12 months of repurchases. During the third quarter, the company repurchased $600 million of stock, and it has returned about $1.57 billion of cash to shareholders this year. As a result, WTW is on track to do $1.5 billion of buybacks this year, in keeping with guidance. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 4% over the past year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow Growth Makes WTW Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in July, I was targeting $1.50-$1.65 in free cash flow (skewed towards the low end) or about $15.75/share. Depending on the exact working capital movements, I expect about $1.475-$1.575 billion of free cash flow this year, or about $15.50 a share. Looking forward, I expect at least $200 million of free cash flow growth in 2026, reflecting ~5% organic growth and then benefits as restricting investments normalize and consume less free cash flow.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, 2026 free cash flow per share should be closer to $18. Given mid-single-digit organic growth and its solid balance sheet, I continue to view a ~5% free cash flow yield as appropriate, or about $360 12-months forward. That provides a ~12% return for investors. Accordingly, after a period of consolidation, I am moving shares back to a “<span>B</span>uy.” I view WTW’s less-cyclical, cash-generative model as particularly attractive in this period of economic uncertainty, and shares are attractively valued, given ongoing capital returns.</p>",

The ETF was incepted in November 2008, a little less than a year<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> into the GFC. Now worth about $2.6 billion in AUM, the fund has delivered a price return of almost 350% since inception, and that gives it a CAGR of 9.3% or thereabouts.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I shall now do a one-eighty, as they say, and tell you that performance is possibly the most minor consideration for this ETF, at least from the educational POV that this article is intended to showcase. It matters to the investor, of course, but performance in this case is a direct function of how the leverage works, and that is what I plan to get at today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, this is not intended to be a long-term holding because of the daily reset on asset value, among other things. Secondly, it carries the very real risk of a complete wipeout of invested monies. Third, and indeed most important of all, it is highly concentrated from a sector perspective, which tends to amplify the leverage to create even greater risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the ETF is designed to be this way so it is no accident that these and other considerations emerge. In today's article, we shall explore the inner workings of this fund that literally triples its odds in favour of the Financial sector… and it has been doing this every day for the past 17 years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FAS Core Holdings and How They Are Selected</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's holdings are essentially a reproduction of the stocks tracked by the Financial Select Sector Index TR (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IXMTR:IND\" title=\"Financial Select Sector Index TR\">IXMTR:IND</a>), which in turn comprises all the equities that make up the financial slice of the GICS cake, GICS being S&amp;P's and MSCI's creation from 1999 that divides the S&amp;P universe into industry-based groupings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, the index is made up of the largest-cap companies operating in the financial sector in the United States. However, the allocations are not as simple as assigning weightings to match their market caps. What the index does is further reorder the selection based on the public free float, or shares that retail investors and the institutional investment community at large have access to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is an important aspect because a company that is much larger by market cap could well have a public float much smaller than that of a smaller-cap equity. That would give the company with the higher free float a higher ranking than it would have gotten with only a market-cap-based sort order.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What this ultimately does is give FAS investors an equity pool that is arranged not only in market-cap order but also by free-float percentage, giving the fund adequate ETF share liquidity. This is evidenced by the fund's dollar trading volume of nearly $90 million against the sector median of just $1.5 million. To give you a clearer view of what that means, I show you this:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1678\" data-height=\"353\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FAS Liquidity Grade\" width=\"640\" height=\"135\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617893718380167_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you compare the daily dollar volume with the AUM and see how all other ETFs fare, it should come through quite clearly that FAS possesses superior liquidity compared to the bulk of ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This leads us to the holdings themselves, with the top ten featuring all the well-known heavy hitters of the U.S. financial universe.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1723\" data-height=\"612\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FAS Top Ten Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"227\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61680838-17617895665055754_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Brings the \"3X\" Leverage Factor into Play?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For readers with a sharp eye, nestled cozily between Mastercard Incorporated (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA\" title=\"Mastercard Incorporated\">MA</a>) and Bank of America Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) is the first hint of leverage in the form of an index swap. This is the origin of the daily leverage because the equity holdings themselves are not subject to daily rebalancing. No, the fund itself follows the quarterly rebalancing schedule of the underlying index for its equity holdings, but the swap agreements the fund managers enter into utilize a daily strategy designed to yield three times the daily movement of the holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there is a catch, of course, and it is the fact that this three-times-daily capture is not only to the upside; if the index drops 10% on any trading day, the fund should, in theory, lose 30%. This is where the very real risk of losing one's entire capital comes into play. If the financials sector index underlying the ETF drops by 33.34%, three times that would spell disaster.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This leverage arises from the use of index swaps, so that is our next port of call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Swap Agreements And How They Work</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A swap, in the simplest terms, is a handshake between two parties (party and counterparty) based on a mutually agreed arrangement to exchange the daily cash flows of their respective assets. One side pays a fixed rate, usually on top of the prevalent SOFR, while the other pays the equivalent of the price movement of the underlying asset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the heart of every swap is the notional amount, and it is on this notional value that the cash flow exchange takes place daily. Please excuse me if the following analogy oversimplifies things, but it is important that one fully grasp this concept.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Say, for example, that one owns a house with a fixed rental income. One is the asset, the other its cash flow. This rental income is nice, but one now wants a higher rate of return. Since the rental income is fixed or, more accurately, relatively stable, where is the additional gain going to come from?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This being the problem statement, along comes a solution in the form of a motel owner who sees daily fluctuations in cash flow. On certain days, she makes three times the pro-rata rental income that the homeowner makes, and on others, the take is almost negligible; for the sake of this example, we shall assume that on these other days, her gain is three times lower than the daily gain with the rent. She has had enough of this and now wants a steady cash flow that is independent of and essentially decoupled from her motel's daily income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A perfect pairing involves the two parties agreeing to exchange their daily cash flows, but there is now the issue of the notional amount. What common asset value can the two agree on, and on which are the percentage payouts based? This could be the market value of the house, which means the homeowner would be paying a percentage of a pre-agreed daily market value. The motel owner would agree to pay a percentage of that same value, but that percentage would be proportionate to the gains she made that day from her motel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What this amounts to is that the motel owner is willing to give up higher gains and higher losses in exchange for a relatively stable income. The homeowner is willing to take on the motel owner's risk in the hope that the 'good' days will outnumber the 'bad' days and result in a net gain for any period of time longer than one trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is by no means the perfect analogy, but implicit in this agreement is that cash is settled on a daily basis, and this is effectively where the daily reset arises. Once a cash flow is exchanged, a loss or a gain would materially alter the value of the asset on which the notional amount is based, so that the notional amount could now be either lower or higher than the day before. This is how the daily reset works.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this equation, the fund is our homeowner who pays a fixed rate on the notional amount, while the motel owner is the counterparty to the swap agreement who pays a variable rate. That variable rate could either be three times higher or three times lower than the fixed rate, depending on how the home's asset value moved over the course of that day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After that, it is simply a matter of rinse and repeat. We shall now see the end result of how this works in the real world.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_172a3d26ee32727eed4fdcec3a1dc0c2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is data for one trading day: October 29, 2025. While the index (a proxy for the total return index, which is unavailable in YCharts) declined by 1.7%, FAS lost 5.24%, or more than 3X.

Brands, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YUM\" title=\"Yum! Brands, Inc.\">YUM</a></span>) will report <a href=\"https://investors.yum.com/news-events/financial-releases/news-details/2025/Yum-Brands-Announces-Q3-2025-Earnings-and-Conference-Call-Details/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 FY25</a> earnings pre-market on Tuesday, November 4th. Going into earnings, I am slightly bullish, but not expecting any huge movement. I will be looking for Pizza Hut<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and Taco Bell to maintain momentum or show modest improvements, and KFC’s international segment to show steady unit growth. Shares are currently trading around $140 and appear to have expectations for modest growth already baked in. The key topics to watch will be around value menu demand, margin pressure from labor inflation, and tech stack execution.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Setup</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum will release earnings at 7:00 a.m. EST, Tuesday, November 4th, followed by a conference call at 8:15 a.m. EST. Yum stock has stayed relatively flat since its last earnings call, and is up around 5% since the start of the year. Going into the release, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/yum/earnings\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus estimate</a> EPS of $1.49, revenue of $1.94B, and sales growth of 5%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Snapshot</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum! Brands is the company behind Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger. They operate over <a href=\"https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/company\" rel=\"nofollow\">61,000 franchised and company-owned restaurants</a> (98% franchised). <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/890585342/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Yum-Brands-Q4-24-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Last year,</a> Yum returned $7.57B in revenue with KFC accounting for $3.10B (41%), followed by Taco Bell with $2.86B (38%), Pizza Hut with $1.01B (13%), and The Habit Burger Grill with $600M (8%). <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/890585342/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Yum-Brands-Q2-25-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">In Q2</a>, digital system sales surpassed $9B. This marked an increase to 57% digital mix of orders. Customers are increasingly choosing to pivot toward the higher-margin mobile, delivery, and pickup channels. Yum’s strength compared to their peers like Restaurant Brands International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QSR\" title=\"Restaurant Brands International Inc.\">QSR</a>) and McDonald’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) is in their steady growth and new store expansion, but their margins are thinner than those of their competitors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What To Watch</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>KFC International Pipeline:</strong> After KFC opened over 550 new locations in Q2 across 58 countries, it will be important to listen for commentary on 2026 openings, specifically in Asia and Latin America. International expansion is crucial for measuring franchise partners' confidence in Yum! Brands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Same-Store Sales:</strong> Market will be looking for KFC to expand unit sales at a solid pace and for Taco Bell to post small same-store sales growth in line with past quarters. Value promotions are expected to increase now and will be necessary for traffic to hold up.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Tech Efficiency:</strong> Watch for commentary on the rollout of “Byte by Yum!”, Yum’s internal AI system, to see if their investment in AI is accelerating labor or delivery-cost efficiencies.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Commodity Cost:</strong> Last quarter inflation on protein, cheese, and labor was a stumbling block for Yum. Watch for a lift in margins from a greater digital mix.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that Yum’s near-term performance will rely on how effectively it manages price-value perceptions amid a cautious US consumer. A key value in protecting this perception will be <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taco-bell-expands-luxe-value-154409314.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taco Bell’s value menu remaining a key traffic driver</a>. Additionally, I believe success in KFC’s international expansion will be necessary for offsetting potentially modest domestic softness. A major long-term growth driver in the business will be margin improvements driven by easing input costs, growing digital mix, and AI implementation. Management’s commentary on \"Byte by Yum!\" will be key in driving this sentiment. Evidence of early labor efficiencies or order throughput from AI integration will majorly help in seeing the long-term growth story at Yum. The defensive nature of Yum’s brands gives confidence that there is limited downside risk going into earnings. To see any meaningful upside, Yum would likely need to report same-store sales growth greater than 3% and stronger than expected international unit growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Context Going Into Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Yum’s last earnings call for Q2 FY25, Yum reported total sales growth of 4%. Taco Bell’s same-store sales grew 4% and KFC 5%. They mentioned that the consumer value was a priority and that supply chain pressures were easing steadily. The key question going into Q3 will be whether Yum can maintain their same-store sales momentum despite consumer price sensitivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the <a href=\"https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/qsr-s-traffic-woes-may-be-driven-by-deal-fatigue\" rel=\"nofollow\">quick-service restaurant industry experiencing a 3.4%</a> decline year over year, Yum has been able to maintain steady sales growth. This perseverance highlights the strength of pricing power in its leading brands. Yum! Brands are likely capturing share from smaller operators, evidenced by the negative transaction counts of US quick-service peers. Yum has been able to preserve profitability even in these periods of soft volume due to their combination of scale, franchising model, and strong brand equity. These qualities separate Yum from their peers and are justification for its premium valuation to their restaurant peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using a discounted cash flow approach with a 6.8% WACC and a 2.25% terminal growth rate, I estimate Yum! Brands’ intrinsic value is at $173 per share. This represents a roughly 24% upside from the current share price of $139.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I calculated a 6.8% WACC reflecting Yum’s roughly 76% equity and 24% debt capital structure, a beta of 0.72, and a 4.0% risk-free rate. I applied a market risk premium of 3.85%, consistent with mature US consumer discretionary peers. I used a 4.33% pre-tax cost of debt and a 15% effective tax rate, in line with the company’s historical filings and guidance. Finally, I assumed a 2.25% terminal growth rate to reflect the long-term inflation and global GDP growth expectations relevant to a diversified fast food operator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The revenue growth assumptions of 6% falling to 5% by 2029 reflect moderate international expansion and steady system sales. I assume EBIT margins are rising from 34% up to 36% as Yum recognizes operational efficiencies from AI and leverage from digital ordering becoming more popular. Capital Expenditures, depreciation, and changes in NWC were modeled at 3%, 2%, and 1% of sales, respectively, consistent with Yum’s asset-light, franchise structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, Yum trades at $139. Based on my DCF calculations, I believe the fair value is near $170-$180 per share. The sensitivity analysis shows an intrinsic value ranging from $150 - $190 under reasonable adjustments to the discount rate and terminal growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793180731606_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"872\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793180731606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Yum!

The key factor from this point in getting Yum to reach this price target will be dependent on management’s ability to sustain same-store sales growth and margin gains across KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut’s international segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793074904059_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793074904059_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Yum!

Brands DCF Sensitivity Analysis <span>(Matthew Doherty Excel)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum currently trades at 28x earnings, close to Restaurant Brands International’s multiple, operator of chains like Popeyes and Burger King, and below the premium valuation of McDonald’s and Chipotle. At this current valuation, the market is confident in Yum’s steady earnings growth and global scale. Their valuation reflects slower anticipated near-term growth compared to the higher multiple peers like Chipotle. Pricing is consistent with expectations for mid-single-digit sales growth and stable margins. There is an opportunity surprise on the upside through digital efficiencies or an outperformance in their international expansion.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Company</td> <td>Ticker</td> <td>Market Cap ($B)</td> <td>P/E (TTM)</td> <td>EV/EBITDA (NTM)</td> <td>Dividend Yield</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Yum!

A softer consumer could limit unit expansion, especially in emerging markets where Yum has been most aggressive. Margin pressure caused by delays or lack of success in the rollout of “Byte by Yum!” or commodity/labor inflation remains a concern. Additionally, foreign exchange volatility or regulatory hurdles will be important to watch as they could negatively impact unit growth and overall profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Read-Through</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum’s earnings report will provide useful information in understanding the health of the value-oriented US consumer. In a recent report from <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deloitte</a>, they found that consumers' financial confidence was decreasing, and they were choosing to make more selective spending decisions. In an article from <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/20/low-income-spending-economy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Washington Post</a></em>, they noted that lower-income Americans were sharply trimming spending. The overall economy and consumer spending are more reliant on the top percentage of earners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum serves consumers who are focused on value. Their earnings print will give us a look into whether broader consumer stress is now creeping in. Taco Bell and KFC delivering resilient consumer traffic and spend would suggest value dining remains a durable corner of consumer behavior. Any signs of weakness in their report may reinforce the idea of widening pressure on middle and lower-income households. This would have implications on not just Yum, but also platforms like DoorDash and similar value restaurant chains.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum! Brands is going into this earnings report with expectations largely priced in. Expect the stock to remain near current levels if management delivers steady same-store sales growth with steady margins. A surprise to the upside will likely be dependent on progress in digital efficiencies or better-than-expected international unit sales. For long-term investors, Yum remains a durable source of consistent cash generation, with future performance mostly tied to operational execution rather than a re-rating opportunity.</p>",

You can find them on our <a href=\"https://marancapital.com/insights\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. As of the end of the third quarter, our firm’s assets under management (AUM) were approximately $47 million. Welcome, new partners.</p> <h2>Explore/Exploit: Going Rogue</h2> <p>Ants and bees are both members of the order <em>Hymenoptera</em>, whose members are typically eusocial, cooperative insects that live in large colonies that can be viewed as superorganisms. When an ant finds an attractive source of food, it leaves a pheromone trail on its way back to its nest that other ants can follow. Bees use a different strategy to alert their compatriots to good finds. They fly back to the hive and do what entomologists have dubbed a “waggle dance.”<sup>2</sup> Through these elaborate dances, bees give their peers directions to a field of newly bloomed flowers (or maybe to a picnic table after a five-year-old’s birthday party).</p> <p>But if every ant simply followed the strongest pheromone trail to the best food source, that food source would eventually run out, and the ant colony would be at a loss. And if every bee simply followed the directions imparted by the most dynamic waggle dance, a beehive would likewise exhaust this resource.</p> <p>Fortunately, some ants and bees have a rogue streak. These intrepid individuals will deviate—veer off from the pheromone trail or shun the directions of the waggle dance—and seek fortune and glory on their own in search of new sources of nectar, honeydew, syrup, or sap.</p> <p>Evolution through natural selection has fine-tuned this balance; most ants and bees follow the proverbial herd (or, in this case, swarm, hive, colony, or army) and target a known food source. But a smaller group will launch out on their own and seek novel sources of food.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman of advertising agency Ogilvy, discussed this in his fun, wide-ranging book, <em>Alchemy: The Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life</em>:</p> <p><em>There is a parallel in the behaviour of bees, which do not make the most of the system they have evolved to collect nectar and pollen. Although they have an efficient way of communicating about the direction of reliable food sources, the waggle dance, a significant proportion of the hive seems to ignore it altogether and journeys off at random. In the short term, the hive would be better off if all bees slavishly followed the waggle dance, and for a time this random behaviour baffled scientists, who wondered why 20 million years of bee evolution had not enforced a greater level of behavioural compliance. However, what they discovered was fascinating: without these rogue bees, the hive would get stuck in what complexity theorists call ‘a local maximum’; they would be so efficient at collecting food from known sources that, once these existing sources of food dried up, they wouldn’t know where to go next and the hive would starve to death. So the rogue bees are, in a sense, the hive’s research and development function, and their inefficiency pays off handsomely when they discover a fresh source of food. It is precisely because they do not concentrate exclusively on short-term efficiency that bees have survived so many million years.</em><sup>4</sup></p> <p>The manner in which ants and bees divide their resources is among a class of ideas that have been dubbed e<em>xplore/exploit </em>problems by zoologists, economists, and computer scientists.<sup>5</sup> Questions related to these problems and their cousins—<em>optimal stopping </em>problems—range from the personal to scientific to corporate realms.</p> <p>How much time should one spend exploring for new sources of food, information, or ideas before shifting to exploiting the current best source? Should one remain in the dating pool or pop the question and seek to settle down? Should a company continue to refine a product or launch it as it is? How much should be spent on R&amp;D in search of new drug candidates vs. on marketing existing products? And as in the classic framing of one <em>optimal stopping </em>problem, how many potential secretaries<sup>6</sup> should one interview before making one an offer of employment?</p> <p>Of course, portfolio managers are faced with similar types of questions. We must determine how we allocate one finite resource—time—between <em>exploring </em>for new investment ideas (and new types of investment ideas) and monitoring, researching, and generally sticking with (<em>exploiting</em>) our existing strategies and positions. Should we follow the herd or veer off on our own? Just how patient should we be with what we have? We must also determine how to allocate another finite resource—our current capital base—amongst a plethora of potential investments. Leverage, cash balances, correlation, and position sizing all factor into the decisions.</p> <p>While economists have come up with optimized algorithms for certain modeled scenarios—the Gittins index, for example, or the 37% rule for the secretary problem—the real world is messy and, as you may have suspected, as analytical as I may be, I do not believe in an algorithmic approach to research, position sizing, or portfolio management.</p> <h2>Wide Funnel, High Bar</h2> <p>Unlike bees, we investors can spend the majority of our time exploring for new investment ideas while simultaneously “exploiting” our existing positions. Sure, we must spend time monitoring and doing ongoing research on our holdings, but at least in a concentrated portfolio like ours, we are left with a lot of time to be on the hunt. I am frequently asked about my approach to sourcing new ideas. The top of our funnel is very broad. I do small amounts of reading, research, and valuation work on a large number of companies. But the real meat of our process comes in the middle of the proverbial funnel—the winnowing down of potential investments from a large list of possibilities to a small, concentrated portfolio of best ideas.</p> <p>I have been investing for my entire career—over 20 years now—so there are many companies, sectors, management teams, and business models that I know well or am familiar with. In addition to following many of these on an ongoing basis, I study many new special situations and event-driven setups as they arise: mergers, spin-offs, reverse-Morris Trust transactions, tenders, rights offerings, and various other sources of corporate change (and thus potential for mis-valuation and catalysts). I am well versed in special situations research, which frequently involves studying proxies, S-1s, S-3s, 8-Ks, 10-Ks, 13Ds, Section 16 filings, PACER filings, and the rest of the alphabet soup of regulatory filings that apply.</p> <p>There are elements to our top-of-the-funnel process that are systematic: The review of various classes of special situations, for example. But like rogue ants and bees, I allow for a large amount of room for serendipity and following my nose. We are not investing in the same types of investments as most funds.</p> <p>While the top of our funnel is wide and allows for variation, the bar for a stock’s inclusion in the portfolio is always very high. When interviewing secretaries, it is unlikely that one will be a hundred times better than others; after getting a feel for the field, one can make a decision and offer a job. But in investing, a fantastic investment can indeed be orders of magnitude better than an average one, so it is worth having a certain amount of patience. On the flip side, our bar can’t be so high that nothing ever meets it. The perfect is the enemy of the good enough.</p> <p>We therefore utilize the concept of a threshold approach: As I have previously discussed, we typically underwrite for an expected IRR of at least 25% (I have famed this as seeking “three-year doubles” or better) with limited risk of permanent capital loss on the downside. While it is easy to focus on the first half of this target (the threshold IRR), the second half (limited downside) is every bit as important. This is why you will tend to see less levered (or net cash) companies in our portfolio. You will also see quality, growth, modest valuations, and, frequently, catalysts.</p> <p>A mid-20s IRR is a high bar, and to be clear, we don’t necessarily expect to generate fund-level returns at that rate. We strive to generate excellent risk-adjusted returns, but we’ll invariably get some stocks wrong along the way or some stocks will take longer than we think to achieve fair value. But by aiming high, we have achieved a ~20% annualized gross return (and therefore mid-to-high teens net return, depending on share class) since inception.<sup>7</sup></p> <h2>Market Backdrop &amp; Portfolio Update</h2> <p>Our top five positions as of the end of the quarter were Clarus Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLAR\" title=\"Clarus Corporation\">CLAR</a>), Correios de Portugal, S.A. (Euronext Lisbon: CTT)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTTPY\" title=\"CTT - Correios De Portugal, S.A.\">OTCPK:CTTPY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTTOF\" title=\"CTT - Correios De Portugal, S.A.\">OTCPK:CTTOF</a>), Horizon Kinetics Holding Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HKHC\" title=\"Horizon Kinetics Holding Corporation\">OTCPK:HKHC</a>), Turning Point Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TPB\" title=\"Turning Point Brands, Inc.\">TPB</a>), and an undisclosed position.<sup>8</sup> You will find none of these companies in broad market indices such as the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>IPO and capital markets activity—including the return of SPACs—has picked up, and there are pockets of froth in the market. A major investment bank recently distributed a list of “meme” stocks; it was comprised of more than 60 companies. AI, quantum, nuclear, rare earth, and space-related stocks are attracting significant speculative capital, regardless of business model quality. As usual, we have no “fear of missing out” (FOMO) on these types of stocks. There is always <em>something </em>we are missing out on, and we are okay with that. There are enough attractively priced companies in the market outside of the bubble areas. We have demonstrated that we can generate solid returns while generally avoiding tech and other trendy sectors.</p> <p>Meme stocks and momentum sectors aside, even many of the highest quality companies in the market do not appear to be inexpensive. Remember, investing is not simply about identifying the best companies. It is easy to note that (at least six of) the Magnificent Seven companies are dominant in their fields. The important question for those that own these stocks, though, is whether they are attractively priced.</p> <p>Steve Mandel, who runs the hedge fund Lone Pine, has been quoted as saying, “I don’t need an analyst to tell me whether a 10x PE stock is cheap; I need one to tell me whether a 40x PE stock is cheap.” We can flip this framing: We don’t need analysts to tell us whether a 40x PE company is quality or growing or loved; we should ask whether a single digit PE stock is quality or growing or can one day be loved. When we find one of these (like APi Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APG\" title=\"APi Group Corporation\">APG</a>), Turning Point Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TPB\" title=\"Turning Point Brands, Inc.\">TPB</a>), or Cadre Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDRE\" title=\"Cadre Holdings, Inc.\">CDRE</a>), among others in our portfolio), I get excited.</p> <p>As I caution in most letters, our portfolio may behave quite differently than the broader market indices over the short term (especially during periods of bubbles and froth in the markets). Unfortunately, we are going through a period this month in which our fund is down while various market indices are up. Several of our core positions have pulled back not due to ascertainable fundamental reasons, but seemingly on account of motivated sellers (perhaps, in some cases, mutual fund tax loss sellers ahead of their fiscal year-ends).</p> <p>I view this recent weakness as an opportunity. I believe our portfolio is attractive and that a number of our core positions have upcoming catalysts. With the appropriate long-term time horizon, I’m confident in our portfolio and approach.</p> <p>I have been working hard on a new idea over the past few quarters, and this position is now in our top five. While I cannot yet discuss it publicly, I look forward to sharing more on this investment in my next letter.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Long-term clients, as well as those who joined in the last quarter: Thank you. I truly appreciate your trust and support. Your alignment and long-term orientation allow me to invest in the manner that I believe will maximize our risk-adjusted returns. I look forward to writing to you again in the new year.
