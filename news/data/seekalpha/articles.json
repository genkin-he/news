Security selection in Communication Services, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary detracted the most from performance, while selection in Consumer Staples added modest value. Although sector allocation effects are residual to Jennison's bottom-up process, they weighed on returns this period. The underweight to Information Technology was the largest detractor, while the overweight to Communication Services and the absence of exposure to Real Estate contributed positively.</li> <li>Ongoing enthusiasm for AI continued to propel both the Technology sector and the broader market during the quarter, with mega-cap tech leaders Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), Meta, and Microsoft significantly increasing capital expenditures in an effort to secure leadership in the space. This unprecedented wave of investment has supported strong demand for specialized NVIDIA and Broadcom chips that power data centers, as well as for critical design and manufacturing companies such as Cadence Design Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDNS\" title=\"Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\">CDNS</a>) and Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>).</li> <li>Throughout the year, Jennison added new holdings positioned to benefit from continued AI infrastructure spending, including Constellation Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CEG\" title=\"Constellation Energy Corporation\">CEG</a>), which is benefiting from higher electricity demand from data center growth and Amphenol (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APH\" title=\"Amphenol Corporation\">APH</a>), a global leader in high-speed connectors essential for advanced semiconductor and AI infrastructure.</li> <li>In contrast, Health Care remained challenging due to policy concerns around drug pricing and reimbursement rates, with the sector lagging the broader market despite some easing of regulatory overhang late in the quarter. Company-specific issues also weighed on results, including disappointing trial data from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX\" title=\"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\">VRTX</a>) and a reduced sales outlook from Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>), prompting the team to exit the latter position.</li> <li>The top contributors to investment results included:<ul> <li> <strong>NVIDIA </strong>benefited from demand for advanced data center and AI computing platforms, unprecedented interest in its Hopper and Blackwell chip architectures, as well as successful execution of major strategic alliances.</li> <li> <strong>Apple's </strong>stock price benefited after the company launched a new, higher priced iPhone lineup that is generating strong early demand.</li> <li> <strong>Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>)'s </strong>share price increased due to elevated demand in the U.S. from consumers seeking to complete purchases ahead of the tax credit expiry and strong demand for a new Model Y in China.</li> <li> <strong>Broadcom's </strong>stock price benefited from record AI chip orders and rising demand for accelerators from new customers.</li> <li> <strong>AppLovin </strong>has experienced strong advertising revenue growth driven by its AI-powered platform,</li> </ul> </li> <li>The top detractors to investments results included:<ul> <li> <strong>Netflix </strong>experienced a modest pullback during the period, reflecting normal fluctuations following an extended period of outperformance.</li> <li> <strong>Trade Desk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTD\" title=\"The Trade Desk, Inc.\">TTD</a>)'s </strong>share price was pressured by advertiser pullbacks related to tariffs, slowing growth, intensifying competition, and a sudden CFO transition. In light of these challenges, Jennison has since removed the position from the Fund.</li> <li> <strong>Novo Nordisk </strong>shares declined after the company lowered its sales and profit outlook, citing intensifying competition in the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) segment and slower growth for key products. Given these headwinds, the team has since sold the position.</li> <li> <strong>Vertex Pharmaceuticals </strong>lost value following disappointing clinical trial results in one of their pain therapy programs.</li> <li> <strong>Intuitive Surgical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ISRG\" title=\"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\">ISRG</a>) </strong>was negatively impacted by margin pressures from higher costs and product mix shifts, alongside concerns about escalating U.S. tariffs and slower international growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Five Contributors</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Security</th> <th>Sector</th> <th>Average Weight</th> <th>Price Change</th> <th>Contribution to Return</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>NVIDIA</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>10.55</td> <td>18.10</td> <td>1.79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Apple</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>4.98</td> <td>24.11</td> <td>1.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tesla</td> <td>Cons Disc</td> <td>2.57</td> <td>40.00</td> <td>1.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Broadcom</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>5.27</td> <td>19.68</td> <td>0.99</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AppLovin</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>0.99</td> <td>105.25</td> <td>0.84</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td>Source for data: FactSet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDS\" title=\"FactSet Research Systems Inc.\">FDS</a>) as of 9/30/2025.

The Fund's largest sector weightings are in Information Technology, Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care.</li> <li>In the third quarter, Jennison sold Abbott Laboratories (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABT\" title=\"Abbott Laboratories\">ABT</a>), Airbnb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB\" title=\"Airbnb, Inc.\">ABNB</a>), AstraZeneca (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>), CAVA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAVA\" title=\"CAVA Group, Inc.\">CAVA</a>), HubSpot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS\" title=\"HubSpot, Inc.\">HUBS</a>), Moody's Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCO\" title=\"Moody's Corporation\">MCO</a>), Novo Nordisk, Progressive (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGR\" title=\"The Progressive Corporation\">PGR</a>), Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>), Starbucks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX\" title=\"Starbucks Corporation\">SBUX</a>), Texas Instruments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TXN\" title=\"Texas Instruments Incorporated\">TXN</a>) and Trade Desk. For the same period, the team initiated positions in Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), Oracle Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) and Toast.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>As the final quarter of 2025 begins, the economy and markets have continued to demonstrate resilience despite lingering uncertainty. Many of the challenges that have emerged over the past nine months, including questions surrounding tariffs, fiscal policy, and geopolitical tensions, remain unresolved, yet the market has continued to advance in the face of them.</li> <li>While potential risks to revenue and earnings growth have not yet materialized, Jennison remains attentive to their possible effects. The market currently appears unconcerned about any significant dampening of consumer spending or broader economic activity. During the quarter, the United States extended a 90-day tariff truce with China, which reduced the immediate risk of broad-based tariff escalation; however, future developments in this area warrant close monitoring.</li> <li>In managing through these uncertainties, the team maintained its disciplined investment approach by focusing on high-quality companies with durable competitive advantages.

Source: Barron's, Feb. 27, 2025. Barron's rankings are based on asset-weighted returns in funds in five categories: U.S. Equity; World Equity; Mixed Asset; Taxable Bond; and Tax-Exempt (each a \"Barron's ranking category\"). Rankings also take into account an individual fund's performance within its Lipper peer universe. Lipper calculated each fund's net total return for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, minus the effects of 12b-1 fees and sales charges. Each fund in the survey was given a percentile ranking, with 100 the highest and 1 the lowest in its category. That ranking measured how a fund compared with its peer \"universe,\" as tracked by Lipper, not just the funds in the survey. Individual fund scores were then multiplied by the 2024 weighting of their Barron's ranking category as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. Those fund scores were then totaled, creating an overall score and ranking for each fund family in the survey in each Barron's ranking category. To qualify for the ranking, firms must offer at least three active mutual funds or actively run ETFs in Lipper's general U.S. Stock category; one in World Equity; and one Mixed Asset. They also need to offer at least two taxable bond funds and one national tax-exempt bond fund. All funds must have a track record of at least one year.</p> <p><strong>Consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing.

This structure can effectively minimize volatility in MLP cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In past market downturns, this business model provided protection to midstream operators, helping to prevent a revenue collapse. As a result, that segment of the energy sector delivered robust free cash flow even at low commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Critical pipeline and storage capacity has high average utilization. Regardless of short-term price movements. The demand for transporting energy products is relatively inelastic. Thanks to these defensive characteristics, midstream MLPs have proven comparatively resilient during periods of market stress, often serving as a stable income harbor within the energy sector.<sup>1</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Midstream MLPs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"369\" height=\"563\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structurally, we believe that several tailwinds will shape the outlook for midstream performance. At the top of that list is a burgeoning demand for natural gas, both at home and around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cleaner energy sources are replacing dirtier ones, and calls for electricity are increasing. U.S. natural gas consumption and exports continue to rise, fueled by volume growth to power-hungry data centers (for artificial intelligence), as well as liquid natural gas (LNG) shipments abroad.<sup>2</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, energy transitions such as switching from coal to gas for electric generation, and increased worldwide energy demand continue to underpin the growth prospects for natural gas infrastructure.<sup>3</sup> North American midstream operators could benefit from new LNG export capacity as well as additional terminals coming online. Volumes moving through pipelines face no shortage of potential tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, the U.S. Energy Information Administration is forecasting all-time highs for U.S. natural gas production, as supply continues to ramp up to meet global demand.<sup>4</sup> Significant private capital investments in energy infrastructure and pro-infrastructure policies are opening additional growth opportunities for pipeline and export facilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A number of midstream companies have also spent the past few years strengthening their balance sheets by paying down debt and practicing disciplined project spending, which positions them to ride these tailwinds without putting stability at risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the more remarkable aspects of the MLP rebound story is just how much cash these assets can generate.<sup>5</sup> Midstream MLPs normally come with a distribution yield similar to asset-intensive industries, such as real estate, utilities or fixed income investments.<sup>6</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the sector has been producing high single-digit yields - an attractive payout for investors. And remember that these distributions are typically supported by stable fee-based cash flows, adding potentially sustainable income streams over commodity price cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors interested in capitalizing on the potential MLP revival can consider a fund like the InfraCap MLP ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZA\" title=\"InfraCap MLP ETF\">AMZA</a></span>). AMZA provides a diversified portfolio of 15–35 midstream MLPs with an emphasis on high current income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike passive index trackers, this actively managed ETF selectively overweights quality MLP names based on fundamental analysis, and uses modest leverage (typically 20–30%) and option writing to enhance income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This approach has paid off throughout past volatile conditions: AMZA outpaced the leading Alerian MLP Index through the challenging macro cycle over the five-year period ending September 30, 2025 (2020–2025).<sup>7</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equally important for investors, AMZA offers the tax advantages of a C-Corp ETF (issuing a single Form 1099 instead of multiple K-1s), while preserving the high yields of the MLP structure.<sup>8</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result is an accessible, one-ticket solution for those seeking to enjoy the stable cash flows and infrastructure growth prospects of midstream MLPs without the complexity of direct MLP ownership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZA performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"625\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZA fees and expenses\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"77\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Midstream MLPs appear poised for a resurgence, with relatively stable, fee-based business models and supportive industry trends.

With investments<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> secured by tangible assets, it’s an exciting and growing sector for investors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kristofer Kraus: </strong>Asset-based finance at PIMCO refers to all forms of private market lending that exist outside of the more traditional parts of the market. So, as you think about corporate direct lending, as you think about commercial real estate, we're focused on the opportunity set that exists outside of those two areas of the market. Much of that relies on mortgage credit as part of the opportunity set as well as consumer credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel J. Ivascyn: </strong>This is the type of asset that throughout history and we have plenty of case studies here. You can get very, very attractive resiliency by taking on a little bit of complexity, a little bit of illiquidity, but being much more sheltered from economic shocks. This is one of the most attractive opportunities that we’ve seen in a long time, especially from a relative value perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>PIMCO is one of the most experienced investors in asset-based finance with a history that dates back to the launch of mortgage-backed securities more than 50 years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Harin de Silva: </strong>We are not tourists in this market. We’ve been in these markets for a long period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kristofer Kraus: </strong>We've been in business for 54 years. We've been a dominant participant in private markets for the last 15 years. And one of the benefits I think of working at PIMCO and for our clients too is the footprint that we have across markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>With more than $225B deployed in private asset-based finance markets, we are strategically positioned to pursue opportunities for our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our advantage comes down to three qualities – our distinct vantage point across public and private markets, our intelligence based on decades of data, and how we put our experience and ecosystem to work for our clients. Our dual-market lens allows us to cut through complexity and see relative value that others may not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Harin de Silva: </strong>Our ability to navigate both public and private markets gives us a great edge because we look at the relative value between the two markets and we navigate towards the side that gives you better value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Kristofer Kraus: </strong>That interplay between private strategies as well as public strategies and the footprint that we have in public markets and the acumen and the experience that we have as it relates to securitization being an efficient form of term financing has proven to be very, very impactful in terms of driving returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>We ground this perspective in proprietary models built on millions of data points gathered over our 20 years of investing in private credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Harin de Silva: </strong>We apply the same analytical rigor and a lot of the tools that we use in active fixed income in looking and assessing the risk in the private markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Kristofer Kraus: </strong>Consumer data has, you know, been an area of that similar to the approach that we've taken on the residential credit side, where there's just an enormous amount of data that allows us to take a very targeted approach to where we want to invest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>This all then comes to life through our people and our ecosystem. Forged across market cycles, we’ve built the relationships and resources needed to access favorable lending terms, execute on opportunities and adeptly navigate even the most challenging market moments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Daniel J. Ivascyn:</strong> A lot of us have real-time experience going through multiple periods where there were various forms of shocks, rate shocks, economic shocks, shocks to the industry in other ways as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Kristofer Kraus: </strong>That experience, it’s sort of battle-tested investment team, allows us to get through your periods of time where I think the markets will certainly throw some challenges at us. But it’s a time-tested investment process with deep experience that allows us to navigate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>From origination to exit, we manage risk in asset-based finance with precision, offering our clients a steady hand and strategic edge in confidently pursuing long-term outcomes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Disclosure</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This material is provided for information purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments in any jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment strategies discussed herein are speculative and involve a high degree of risk, including a loss of some or all capital. Investments in any asset classes described herein may be volatile, and investors should have the financial ability and be willing to accept such risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>All investments</strong> contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the <strong>bond market</strong> is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. Investments in <strong>asset-based lending</strong> and <strong>asset-backed instruments</strong> are subject to a variety of risks that may adversely affect the performance and value of the investment. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, structural risk, sponsor risk, monoline wrapper risk, and other legal risks. Asset-backed securities across various asset classes may not achieve business objectives or generate returns, and their performance can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. Investments in <strong>residential and commercial mortgage loans</strong>, as well as <strong>commercial real estate debt</strong>, are subject to risks that include prepayment, delinquency, foreclosure, risks of loss, servicing risks, and adverse regulatory developments. These risks may be heightened in the case of non-performing loans. Investments in <strong>mortgage and asset-backed securities</strong> are highly complex instruments that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to early repayment risk. <strong>Structured products</strong>, such as collateralized debt obligations, are also highly complex instruments that typically involve a high degree of risk; the use of these instruments may involve derivative instruments that could result in losses exceeding the principal amount invested. <strong>Private credit</strong> involves investments in non-publicly traded securities, which may be subject to illiquidity risk. Portfolios that invest in private credit may be leveraged and may engage in speculative investment practices that increase the risk of investment loss. Additionally, investments in private credit may be subject to <strong>real estate-related risks</strong>, which include new regulatory or legislative developments, the attractiveness and location of properties, the financial condition of tenants, potential liability under environmental and other laws, as well as natural disasters and other factors beyond a manager’s control.<strong> Real asset investments </strong>including those in<strong> data centers </strong>are subject to a variety of inherent risks that may have an adverse impact on the values of, and returns (if any) from, such investments, including: changes in the general economic climate, local conditions (such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for space), the quality and philosophy of management, competition based on rental rates, attractiveness and location of the properties. Investing in <strong>banks and related entities</strong> is a highly complex field subject to extensive regulation, and investments in such entities may give rise to control person liability and other risks. Investing in <strong>distressed loans and bankrupt companies</strong> is speculative, and the repayment of default obligations contains significant uncertainties. <strong>High-yield, lower-rated securities</strong> involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. <strong>Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)</strong> may involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale to qualified investors only. Investors may lose some or all of their investment, and there may be periods during which no cash flow distributions are received. These investments are exposed to risks such as credit, default, liquidity, management, volatility, interest rate, and credit risk. <strong>Management risk</strong> is the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by an investment manager will not produce the desired results, and that certain policies or developments may affect the investment techniques available to the manager in connection with managing the strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results</strong>. Statements concerning financial market trends or portfolio strategies are based on current market conditions, which will fluctuate. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are appropriate for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the long term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. Outlook and strategies are subject to change without notice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This material contains the opinions of the manager and such opinions are subject to change without notice.

Now, the specter of tariffs is adding to the inflationary brew.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Combine that with recent trends, and it is clear why candy makers are increasingly concerned about keeping costs under wraps. First, the producer price index for the chocolate made from cacao is up 23.6% year over year, following a 55.1% increase in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How? A string of unseasonably bad weather in the regions where cocoa beans are grown has continued to push prices up. The last two years have seen speculation about future crop yields, which has helped push the producer price index even higher, up almost 175% since 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the producer price index for sugar manufacturing is down 6.3% from a year ago, driven by the lower cost of importing raw sugar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, labor costs continue to rise. Average hourly earnings for sugar and confectionery product manufacturing employees are up 4.2% year over year. While that represents a slowdown from the 13.5% jump seen in 2023 and the 5.0% rise in 2024, labor costs have more than recovered from an 8.1% decline in 2022 when rattled supply chains disrupted manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Average number of candy bars earned per hour worked\" width=\"1200\" height=\"627\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How are consumers, candy makers and retailers responding to higher candy costs?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We expect current-dollar spending on Halloween candy to grow 3.8% in 2025 to a record $4.2 billion - nearly double what consumers spent on candy a decade ago. This comes out to about $31.80 per household, and while growth is expected to be close to its pre-pandemic average, higher prices can be expected to take more than a fun-sized bite out of real sales this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our forecast, there is no sugarcoating the fact that growth of current dollar spending on treats is expected to fall short of last year’s 4.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through September, headline consumer price index prices are 3.0% higher, up from a 2.4% gain one year earlier, and earnings for all workers are 3.7% higher this year. As a result, consumers are again worried about shrinkflation when it comes to the size of their paydays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">October’s final reading on consumer sentiment was the lowest since April and May. While consumers are less panicked about inflation, they are increasingly concerned about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830006-economic-risks-of-prolonged-us-government-shutdown\" rel=\"noopener\">job prospects</a>. In such an environment, out-of-pocket items such as candy do okay, but big-ticket items - vehicles, homes, appliances, and 12-foot skeletons - can become deferred purchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another bout of higher prices means confectionery makers will continue to face shrinking margins, and combined with slowing sales, those price increases explain two trends consumers can expect to see when shopping this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the shift toward retailers offering more non-chocolate candies will continue, and second, seasonal sweets will appear on shelves even earlier. Both trends come as candy makers and retailers try to capitalize on solid demand for celebrating and shoppers’ renewed hunt for a good deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The National Retail Federation expects a record percentage of people to engage in the festivities this year and reports that nearly half of those surveyed began shopping before October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2025/10/rising-prices-halloween-us-economic-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

LNGX delivers targeted exposure to the domestic natural gas supply chain, spanning across upstream<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> production from America’s prolific basins and midstream services, which include processing, transportation, and exports. The fund seeks to offer exposure to the structural growth themes that exist across the U.S. natural gas industry.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. natural gas production represents the backbone of global energy supply, with strong tailwinds underpinning the sector’s recent expansion. Natural gas remains the largest source of U.S. energy production, and it has retained this title in every year since 2011.<sup>1</sup> At the same time, the U.S. has transitioned from being a net energy importer to the world’s largest energy exporter in just under a decade, with natural gas exports being a key contributor to that growth.<sup>2</sup> These changing dynamics present the U.S. with a significant opportunity when considering expectations around power consumption, AI leadership, and energy security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our analysis suggests that natural gas may be optimally positioned to capitalize on these budding tailwinds in the near term. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. natural gas complex harbors unique characteristics that distinguish it from global competitors, including favorable export terms, permissive policy tailwinds, and advantageous costs of production. These factors have allowed the U.S. to lead the pipeline in global liquefaction capacity additions through 2030,<sup>3</sup> and we believe our targeted approach to investing in the U.S. natural gas supply chain presents a compelling vehicle for capturing these structural tailwinds. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. Has a Major Opportunity in Natural Gas</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Natural gas is an odorless hydrocarbon natural resource that is extracted directly through natural gas drilling. It’s also a by-product of oil drilling (“associated natural gas production”). Natural gas primarily consists of methane, but it also consists of ethane, butane, and propane (collectively, natural gas liquids, or “NGLs”), which are often separated during processing. It’s used in a variety of residential and commercial applications, which include industrial uses, power generation, heating, cooking, and even transportation. More recently, natural gas has gained importance in power generation as electricity demand continues to rise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent uptick in power demand has led both utilities and AI hyperscalers to seek scalable and reliable solutions for meeting expected demand growth. As a reliable source of baseload power, natural gas has been favored by data center operators for its ability to operate all hours of the day, a critical quality for powering essential tech infrastructure. Natural gas plants also encompass familiar designs that are relatively quick to deploy. This has led to an uptick in orders for gas turbines, with order backlogs that span years.<sup>4</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of August 2025, there are nearly 75 gigawatts (GW) of new gas plant projects in the U.S. that dot the roadmap out to 2030.<sup>5</sup> This is a function of surging worldwide demand for natural gas that is expected to rise to new heights in the coming decade. Current forecasts call for total U.S. natural gas consumption to rise by as much as 25 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2030,<sup>6</sup> representing nearly a 27% increase from 90.3 bcf/d in 2024. Key drivers of demand growth include growing exports, rising power consumption, and budding energy themes like electrification and AI data center expansions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data centers and energy exports have been meaningfully influential drivers of demand. At present, nearly 40% of data center power load is being fueled by natural gas.<sup>7</sup> Should gas plant deployments persist and natural gas gain a greater share in AI power demand, Bloomberg projects gas power consumption from AI and data centers could rise to as much as 6.8 bcf/d by 2030, which could boost total U.S. gas-powered consumption by nearly 14%.<sup>8</sup> The growth rates are even more stark when reviewing the roadmap for U.S. water-bound natural gas export capacity (“liquefaction capacity”), which is set to more than double to ~29 bcf/d by 2030.<sup>9</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4616\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_01.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"886\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth in Exports Raises the Bar for Natural Gas Production</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global gas demand rose by 78 billion cubic meters in 2024 and is expected to see similar growth in 2025.<sup>10</sup> Asia is the key driver of global demand growth, driven by rising consumption in China and India. India alone is set to increase its LNG imports four-fold by 2030, while China continues to see its power needs grow.<sup>11</sup> We believe such trends are poised to persist over the coming decade, as global themes like electrification and AI growth migrate from developed to developing markets. We believe natural gas will be key to meeting the rise in consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Case in point, natural gas exports represent the lion's share of demand growth within the U.S. and have exerted a powerful demand-pull pressure on U.S. gas production. At the forefront of this trend are U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, which are currently slated to grow 10% per year through the end of the decade.<sup>12</sup> LNG consists of methane, super-chilled to its liquid form at -260-degree Fahrenheit, compressed by a factor of 600 times.<sup>13</sup> While natural gas has historically been difficult to transport for technical and geographic reasons, LNG allows liquefied natural gas to be loaded onto specialized ships for transport and is the key link that makes the intercontinental gas trade possible.<sup>14</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the dominant source of LNG supply, the U.S. exhibits significant clout in global gas markets, which have taken on increasingly geopolitical characteristics in recent years. Europe, for instance, has sought to wean itself off Russian gas imports in the aftermath of the 2022 conflict in Ukraine. Between 2021 and 2024, the EU saw pipeline gas (generally from Russian supply) as a share of imports decline from 70% to 50%, while the share of LNG imports doubled from 20% to 40%. The U.S. has been the biggest benefactor of this shift, thanks to its proximity and status as a politically stable export market. We’ve continued to see this trend proliferate, with U.S. exports to the EU rising to ~$20 billion in 2024, supplying 55% of all EU LNG imports.<sup>15</sup> More recently, global trade partners have increasingly explored U.S. energy exports as a tool for reducing trade deficits. This was evident in trade deals signed with nations like Japan<sup>16</sup> and Korea.<sup>17</sup> Along these lines, the EU has committed to importing $750 billion worth of U.S. energy exports in exchange for lower levies on its exports in the coming years. We believe the bulk of such commitments are likely to be met via natural gas exports.<sup>18</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4022\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_02.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"772\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Opportunity in Upstream Production</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. natural gas production benefits from an abundance of domestic supply, rising demand growth, and a network of natural gas pipelines that enable efficient offtake to demand centers. The United States is home to some of the most prolific shale gas basins in the world, including the Haynesville, Marcellus, and Permian Shales; such shale basins account for nearly 69% of the gas production within the United States and produced as much as 103.2 bcf/d of gas in 2024, more than enough to feed domestic demand.<sup>19</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Haynesville Shale in Northwest Louisiana benefits from export demand, given its proximity and midstream connections to the Gulf Coast. Demand for LNG is expected to drive production growth in Haynesville, following terminal expansions at the Golden Pass and Plaquemines LNG facilities in 2025, which could add as much as 5 bcf/d of incremental capacity by late 2026.<sup>20</sup> The Marcellus Shale in Western Pennsylvania is located close to demand sources in the Northeast and is well positioned to supply gas to Northern Virginia, the proclaimed “data center capital of the world.” PJM, the region’s main power utility, expects winter-peak power demand in the region to rise from 136 GW in 2024 to over 200 GW by the end of the 2030s, fueled by data center expansions.<sup>21</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upstream drilling activity is typically price-driven, and natural gas producers could benefit should prices increase from rising demand growth. Natural gas prices averaged just $2.21 per million British Thermal Units (mmBtu) in 2024, following a period of high production from associated natural gas (a by-product of oil drilling) and relatively flat demand growth.<sup>22</sup> In 2025, natural gas prices are expected to rise again from $3.00 in September 2025 to $4.10 in 2026, thanks to the deployment of LNG export capacity and surprise demand growth linked to AI data center expansions.<sup>23</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher natural gas prices tend to benefit producers, thanks to their ability to raise output, and a period of steadily rising commodity prices could boost upstream valuations. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects dry gas production will rise to a record 107.4 bcf/d in 2026 from 103.2 bcf/d in 2024.<sup>24</sup> The majority of production growth is expected to come from the Haynesville and Marcellus Shales, which are expected to soar by 41% and 9%, respectively, as well as the Permian Basin, where gas production is expected to rise 21% by 2027, according to projections from Morgan Stanley.<sup>25</sup> In our view, this upward price trajectory could be persistent, given the LNG capacity growth that underpins it; this could bring U.S. natural gas prices structurally closer to international price benchmarks as LNG demand overtakes domestic household consumption.<sup>26</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4370\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_03.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"839\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Midstream Opportunity for U.S. Natural Gas</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the upstream opportunity is rooted in raising production, the opportunity in U.S. midstream is in infrastructure expansion. Midstream refers to the segment of the supply chain that operates energy transmission facilities that connect our shale basins to end-users (homes, businesses, and export markets). It also encompasses the processing, storage, and compression services that prepare it for end markets, which includes the liquefaction process that converts raw natural gas into LNG. Consequently, midstream energy infrastructure is essential to growing upstream production because it allows for the unloading of gas that has been produced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shale Revolution unlocked vast reserves of natural gas, but until recently, infrastructure constraints kept gas production landlocked, leading to regional supply gluts and the capping of natural gas prices within the U.S. (Unlike crude oil, natural gas is not easily transported and must be pressurized or liquefied to move in large quantities across vast distances.) This has historically led to wide price disparities in global gas prices, and this is evidenced in the wide price differentials between U.S. gas benchmark prices and international trading hubs in Europe and Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The tide turned in 2016, when Cheniere Energy’s first shipment from its Sabine Pass terminal departed for foreign shores.<sup>27</sup> Since then, millions of tonnes of new capacity have come online as legacy import terminals were converted for export purposes, and new liquefaction trains were constructed to grow export capacity (liquefaction trains are the units that process and liquefy natural gas for export). This is what transformed the United States into the world’s largest gas supplier over the past decade,<sup>28</sup> a monumental pivot for the global energy trade. Today, the U.S. is able to capitalize on its ample supply as the world’s largest LNG exporter, while Europe and Asia remain “price-takers,” reliant on imports and compelled to compete for limited LNG cargos.<sup>29</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The United States is projected to lead global LNG capacity additions in nearly every year through 2030, accounting for ~48.3% of all liquefaction capacity additions beyond the Final Investment Decision (FID),<sup>30</sup> the stage at which firms officially commit to project development. These expansions align with the United States’ supportive energy policy, which lifted the previous administration’s pause on permitting and declared a national energy emergency to accelerate approvals for pending energy infrastructure projects.<sup>31</sup> This policy shift has already facilitated the approvals for several major LNG projects in 2025, including Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur Phase 2,<sup>32</sup> Commonwealth LNG,<sup>33</sup> Golden Pass LNG,<sup>34</sup> and a 13% capacity expansion at Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG.<sup>35</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the continued expansion of LNG export capacity could more closely integrate U.S. natural gas supplies with global markets, providing strong incentives and a clear roadmap for domestic producers to raise output. In our view, this creates an opportunity across the U.S. natural gas value chain where, as midstream export infrastructure expands, upstream production can scale, and both segments stand to benefit from the world’s growing demand for LNG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4649\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_04.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"892\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">LNGX: Focuses on the U.S. Natural Gas Supply Chain</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Global X U.S. Natural Gas ETF is an index-based passive ETF that invests in U.S.-listed and domiciled upstream and midstream companies that derive at least 50% of their total proved reserves (for upstream) or revenues (for midstream) from natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs), based on the definitions below.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Upstream Significant-Play: </strong>Companies with Natural Gas and NGL proved reserves accounting for at least 75% of their total proved reserves, as per FactSet REVERE Fundamentals.</li> <li> <strong>Upstream Pure-Play: </strong>Companies with Natural Gas and NGL proved reserves accounting for at least 50% of their total proved reserves, as per FactSet REVERE Fundamentals (40% for existing index components).</li> <li> <strong>Midstream Pure-Play: </strong>Companies earning greater than or equal to 50% of revenue attributable to Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids businesses.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Global X U.S. Natural Gas Index, which LNGX tracks, employs a modified free-float market cap-weighted approach, which prioritizes upstream producers that hold significant natural gas reserves as a proportion of their proved reserves and includes midstream firms that attribute the majority of their revenues to natural gas and NGLs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe LNGX’s value chain approach grants exposure to natural gas producers, transporters, and exporters that allows investors to express a view on the structural growth themes underpinning expansion in this space. Its pure-play focus offers targeted natural gas exposure while limiting corresponding exposure to oil and refined petroleum businesses. Further, its domestic orientation attempts to isolate the tailwinds driving the U.S. natural gas industry amidst the global “winner-take-all” backdrop.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. natural gas industry has witnessed a surge in demand driven by a call for LNG by allies overseas and a sudden jump in power consumption, which demands multiples of the growth in power generation we’ve seen over previous decades. Such trends present opportunities for all segments of the natural gas supply chain, from our resource-rich shale basins to the industrializing export terminals on our shores, opportunities which we believe are characteristics of America’s exceptional resource base. The Global X U.S. Natural Gas ETF targets these trends by tracking an index of domestic firms with strong ties to the U.S. natural gas industry while avoiding potentially dilutive exposure in overseas names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>U.S. Energy Information Administration (2025, June 9).

This marked a 6-month low, tying April for the lowest level of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the year. It came in below expectations for a smaller moderation to 49.6.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The slowdown was seen across all the major subcategories. Production fell into contraction for the first time in 6 months, down to 49.7. This was the lowest level since May 2023. The new orders subindex also fell after two consecutive months of increases, down to 48.8, the lowest level since August 2024. New export orders contributed to this decline, falling to a 6-month low of 45.9. Employment remained in contraction for a 32nd consecutive month. Yet, it saw a relatively smaller downturn of just 0.2pp to 48.3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw large, medium, and small-sized enterprises all sliding into contractionary territory for the first time since April. The trend of larger enterprises outperforming continued in the month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The downturn in the PMI marks a poor start to the fourth quarter and may cause some concern, given that growth has been supported by external demand and industrial activity. On a brighter note, the PMI has been in contractionary territory since April, but this has not translated into weakness in hard activity data. Come next month's PMI data, it will be interesting to see if the tariff reduction and extended trade truce with the US help support a recovery of new export orders.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing PMI saw a broad-based downturn to reach a 6-month low</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"894\" data-height=\"424\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Manufacturing PMI saw a broad-based downturn to reach a 6-month low\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618903295136232_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Non-manufacturing PMI continues to hover near the key threshold</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The non-manufacturing PMI fared better on the month, rising slightly to 50.1 and barely returning to expansionary territory.

New orders remained unchanged at 46.0, with new export orders seeing a sharp drop of 3.6pp to 46.2. The main reasons behind the recovery appeared to be tied to an uptick in business expectations to 56.1, as well as slight recoveries in input prices (49.4) and selling prices (47.8), which nonetheless remained in contraction.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Non-manufacturing PMI edges back into expansion</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"863\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Non-manufacturing PMI edges back into expansion\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761890316179045_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Since then, Tenable's continued downward drip has made the stock increasingly more attractive, especially as growth has stabilized around the ~10% range. No, Tenable isn't the most exciting growth stock in the market, but at the same time, its exposure management and cyber vulnerability tools are highly applicable to all industries and unlikely to be terribly disrupted by AI, giving Tenable a long runway to expand its sizable TAM. I remain at a \"Buy\"<strong> </strong>rating here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder for investors who are newer to Tenable, here is what I consider to be the long-term bull case for the company:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Tenable has an attractive horizontal software product.<strong> </strong>Its exposure management platform differentiates it from the larger cybersecurity vendors in its category. Its technology is applicable to both small and large firms across industries.</li> <li>Large $50 billion TAM.<strong> </strong>Tenable recently updated its long-term TAM estimates to be $50 billion, with an expected ~20% growth CAGR through FY27. This indicates that the company is only ~2% penetrated into its overall market.</li> <li>Recurring revenue built on top of high gross margins. Tenable has GAAP gross margins in the high 70%s. On top of its pure recurring revenue base, the company has plenty of room to drive economies of scale as it continues to land and retain large clients.</li> <li>Growth and profitability balance. Though Tenable falls just short of the Rule of 40, the company's combination of ~10% top-line growth plus a low 20s pro forma operating margin gives the company a very healthy growth/profitability profile.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, the biggest reason to buy Tenable is its cheap price. At current share prices near $30, Tenable trades at a market cap of $3.58 billion. After we net off the $383.5 million of cash and $354.8 million of debt on Tenable’s latest balance sheet, the company’s resulting enterprise value is $3.55 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Tenable slightly boosted the low end of its full-year billings guidance, while increasing its revenue outlook to $988-$992 million, or 10% growth ($981-$987 million previously). It’s also expecting a healthy 21.5% pro forma operating margin, ~20 bps higher than its previous forecast.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1810\" data-height=\"948\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tenable outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Tenable outlook <span>(Tenable Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And for next year, FY26, Wall Street is expecting the company to hit $1.07 billion in revenue (+8% y/y) and $1.77 in pro forma EPS (+14% y/y).

We note as well that while it's not the only plausible path to take gains on this investment, the cybersecurity industry has been a hotbed for consolidation recently, with <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-announces-agreement-to-acquire-cyberark--the-identity-security-leader\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-announces-agreement-to-acquire-cyberark--the-identity-security-leader\" target=\"_blank\">Palo Alto Networks recently buying CyberArk</a>.

Revenue growth largely kept pace with 12% y/y growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What investors may have pressed on was the fact that Tenable's billings, which clocked in at $267.5 million (+8% y/y), remained below revenue growth and at the same y/y growth pace as in Q2, which is a forward-looking indicator of Tenable's eventual deceleration from double-digit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two reasons to not be overly pessimistic on single-digit billings growth, however. The first is that Street expectations are already low for this stock, which explains the steep share price decline all year. As previously mentioned, Wall Street is only expecting 8% revenue growth for FY26, which is in line with billings, so any \"weakness\" perceived in this number is already priced into the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second potential upside driver: we have to recall that the \"current billings\" that Tenable reports represent the short-term deferred revenue backlog that will be recognized in a 12-month timeframe. When we stack up longer-term RPOs (remaining performance obligations), however, the story looks better. As shown below, Tenable's long-term RPOs grew 45% y/y to $259.8 million.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1906\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tenable RPO trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Tenable RPO trends <span>(Tenable Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This indicates that Tenable is signing larger, multi-year deals. As more of this RPO moves into short-term billings, we may see further support to keep Tenable's growth rates from decelerating too much. Tenable's increasing trend toward longer contract durations, on top of its existing trend of net revenue expansion as customers increase their spending on the Tenable platform, are all long-term stabilizers for the company's growth trajectory. More context from CFO Matthew Brown's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835043-tenable-holdings-inc-tenb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835043-tenable-holdings-inc-tenb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q3 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Our percentage of recurring revenue remained high at 95% this quarter. We're continuing to see solid momentum in Tenable One as customers are increasingly turning to our platform to bolster their preemptive security programs. The strength in new platform growth in the quarter drove calculated current billings, or CCB, to $267.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 7.7%, while short-term remaining purchase obligations, or CRPO, grew 12.9%.

Rates on the deposit facility, main refinancing operations, and the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> marginal lending facility remain at 2.00%, 2.15%, and 2.40%, respectively.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With economic activity continuing to grow, ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the central bank is in a very good place and will remain attentive to any emerging risks to ensure it stays there.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent economic developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth: Despite weakness in manufacturing, which remains pressured by trade uncertainty and a stronger euro, slightly stronger than expected growth was driven by a resilient services sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer fundamentals also remain supportive, with real incomes rising, unemployment near historic lows, and solid household balance sheets, suggesting there’s room for increased spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the EU-U.S. trade deal over the summer, the ceasefire in the Middle East, and Thursday’s announcement of progress in the U.S.-China trade negotiations, have lessened downside risks to growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation: While inflation remained relatively firm in September, hovering just above the ECB’s 2% target, Lagarde expressed confidence in the path of inflation, citing that its outlook is broadly unchanged. Still, symmetrical risks to inflation remain, with supply chain disruptions, stronger consumer demand, or climate-related supply shocks having the potential to push prices higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Policy outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With resilient economic activity and monetary policy transmission remaining effective, Lagarde noted that the ECB is successfully navigating the broad range of uncertainties to its outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, with positive developments in the trade and geopolitical environment, the risk backdrop has tilted more positively. Fiscal policy should also continue to play an important role, with defense and infrastructure spending, particularly in Germany, helping to support the broader outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, with risks still on the horizon, the ECB continued to reiterate its data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, remaining committed to keeping policy properly calibrated. That said, while further easing is unlikely for now, the ECB hasn’t closed the door on rate cuts should conditions deteriorate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/macro-views/october-ecb-meeting-steady-rates-good-place\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

The team optimistically views duration exposure in countries such as Hungary, India, and Malaysia, where disinflation trends and proactive central banks create scope for easing. Currency exposure is concentrated in markets with improving external balances, including the Philippines and Malaysia, while we remain cautious toward economies facing election-driven fiscal risk or overvalued exchange rates, such as Romania and Poland.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Hungary:</strong> Our overweight in duration was concentrated largely in the green bond. Real rates are attractive, in our opinion, and although they are now closer to the terminal rate, the central bank has been one of the most progressive in the region. A renewed European focus on meeting excessive deficit targets may help moderate the size of the fiscal deficit in the coming period despite the wider acceptance that Europe needs to raise defense spending. As we get close to next year’s election, an increased focus will be placed on who the market expects to win.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>India:</strong> We are overweight Indian duration as we expect India’s services exports, remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI), and portfolio flows to support India’s balance of payments. Low inflation should enable the central bank to maintain favorable liquidity conditions throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Philippines:</strong> We are overweight the Philippine peso, as lower oil prices this year are likely to improve the country’s terms of trade. Remittance growth has been strong, and lower inflation has allowed the central bank to lower policy rates to support economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Chile:</strong> In Chile, we have maintained our underweight to the local curve in favor of higher-yielding regional peers. While Chile underperformed the benchmark over the past quarter, we expect peso performance to improve on higher copper prices as global supply shocks drive the market higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Malaysia:</strong> In Malaysia, we remain overweight on the ringgit. Economic growth remains resilient, supported by private consumption. Fiscal consolidation efforts are ongoing. The currency outperformed last year but remains inexpensive on a trade-weighted basis. We are overweight Malaysia's duration as inflation is benign, and the central bank has room to ease policy rates should trade uncertainty spill over to dampen Malaysia’s economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Romania:</strong> In Romania, we hold an underweight position in the leu, as we have concerns about the twin deficits, particularly during an election cycle. We are awaiting a rerun of the presidential election this year, and the coalition has not delivered on a strong fiscal consolidation plan. The currency is also overvalued, in our opinion, and contributes to a lack of competitiveness in the region and a large current account deficit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Poland:</strong> In Poland, we are underweight the zloty on valuations and expectations of some reversal of the strength we saw in 2024. At the same time, we are underweight rates on the back of a less supportive political outlook for fiscal consolidation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Israel:</strong> The Israeli shekel has been strong in recent months in spite of elevated geopolitical risks; however, we believe there is likely to be less appetite for a significantly stronger shekel from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Thailand </strong>We are underweight Thailand duration because valuations are unappealing. Rate cuts are already priced in, but financial stability concerns may lead to fewer central bank cuts than are currently priced in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China:</strong> We are underweight the Chinese renminbi on uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and trade measures imposed on China. While the central bank has fixed the currency to lower volatility, the renminbi has weakened on a trade-weighted basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>High-Beta Bucket</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In higher-beta markets, positioning reflects a balance between attractive carry opportunities and sensitivity to shifting policy and political dynamics. We remain constructive on Brazil, where high real rates and credible policy settings continue to attract inflows, and maintain exposure to local bonds in Colombia and Mexico as inflation expectations stay anchored. In Turkey, disciplined monetary tightening has reinforced confidence in the reform trajectory despite persistent volatility, while in South Africa, we have adopted a more neutral stance following an oversold period in local rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Brazil:</strong> In Brazil, local assets have continued to outperform. With nominal policy rates peaking at 15% and with one-year-ahead consensus inflation edging down to 4.3%, Brazil has the second-highest real interest rate in the benchmark index after Turkey, which has supported portfolio flows into the country. Growth is also holding up well this year, while expectations for 2026 have slipped in recent months. Lower U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) rates should give the central bank more scope to cut next year, which should help anchor expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Colombia:</strong> We closed our overweight to the Colombian peso with valuations appearing stretched given a challenging macro backdrop. We have further increased exposure to local bonds, however, as the curve is steep and inflation expectations remain well anchored.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mexico:</strong> Mexico outperformed the benchmark index over the quarter in both FX and rates, but we are growing increasingly concerned about deterioration in the growth outlook driven by the manufacturing sector and private consumption generally, with remittances from the U.S. falling. However, rate cuts, well-anchored inflation expectations, and slowing growth should support bonds in the coming months. We also hold an overweight position in Pemex bonds as the government increases direct support for the company, which should lead to narrower spreads to the sovereign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Turkey:</strong> In Turkey, although political volatility has increased, the economic reform path remains intact, allowing for strong performance in many economic indicators, such as current account and FX reserve levels. We believe investors continue to be overcompensated by high yields, which we believe will not be fully eroded by currency depreciation. Investors may also take a closer look at local bonds, as the central bank raised rates in an emergency meeting to help fight currency flight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>South Africa:</strong> In South Africa, we moved to a more neutral position in rates as the sell-off related to the budget delay was overdone, in our opinion. Now that the budget has been passed, we expect a flattening of the curve, with the long end best positioned to benefit from the rally on relative valuation; however, the scope for further compression is limited by the recent strong performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Frontier Bucket</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In frontier markets, positioning remains guided by improving macro fundamentals and attractive real yields. We continue to optimistically view markets where reform momentum and external balances support currency stability—most notably Uganda and Sri Lanka—while maintaining exposure to Zambia, where disinflation and credible monetary policy create scope for further curve compression. In contrast, we remain cautious on commodity-dependent economies such as Mongolia, where weaker export prices and fiscal pressures may weigh on performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uganda:</strong> We remain constructive on Uganda local currency assets, and the relatively mature local currency market allows us to express this view in longer-dated bonds. We hold a long bond position on attractive real rates. We removed our partial hedge of the currency risk, as we became more comfortable with the fundamental support to the exchange rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> In Sri Lanka, strong remittances and resumption of FDI balance out U.S. dollar demand from the central bank to rebuild foreign exchange (FX) reserves and narrowing the current account surplus on increasing import needs. The combination of the above supports a stable outlook for the rupee, which offers attractive carry return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Zambia:</strong> We maintain our long position in Zambian bonds given the scope for further disinflation in 2025 to support the performance. While the central bank is likely to remain hawkish in light of short-term risks from, among other things, the global backdrop, we see potential scope for the local currency yield curve to bull steepen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nigeria:</strong> In Nigeria, the disinflation process appears to be firmly in place, and we believe the authorities have done a good job in improving the potential for economic stability. Transparency in the local FX market has improved, and there remains a strong capital flow of international money into the local Nigerian market to support the appreciation trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mongolia:</strong> In Mongolia, we hold an underweight position in the Mongolian tugrik, as lower coal prices are likely to impact the country’s commodity export proceeds this year. Mongolia relies on commodity exports, and declining commodity prices should exert pressure on the country’s fiscal and external balances. Despite government and central bank efforts to stabilize the currency, the tugrik may still need further depreciation due to its rich valuation and the anticipated weaker terms of trade this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://active.williamblair.com/emerging-markets-debt/lewis-jones/local-markets-shine-in-a-solid-quarter-for-em-debt/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

October is typically the month when companies adjust<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> prices. A 0.6% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted, increase suggests businesses are raising final prices in response to input price hikes. Prices increased for both goods (0.9%) and services (0.4%), with notable gains in labour-intensive sectors like transport, communication, and entertainment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bank of Japan views this as evidence that sustainable wage growth is driving prices higher. Meanwhile, food prices rose, but at a slower pace. Utilities prices jumped as government subsidies ended. We expect core CPI to remain around 2.5% by the end of this year, backed by solid wage growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Takaichi government plans to fight inflation by reducing the gasoline tax and offering temporary discounts on winter power and gas bills. This may lower headline inflation early next year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"844\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"677\" data-height=\"164\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Industrial production (%MoM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial output rebounded stronger than expected 2.2% MoM sa in September, for the first time in three months</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial production decreased by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, primarily due to reductions in output related to US tariffs. Transportation equipment and iron/steel output declined in September, likely due to the lingering effects of US tariffs. Still, the recent easing of tariff tensions in several countries should support Japan's production rebound in the coming months. Semiconductor equipment sales rose for a second consecutive month, suggesting that strong global chip demand continued. Meanwhile, retail sales rebounded 0.3% MoM in September but missed the market consensus of 0.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both IP and retail sales fell in Q3, indicating a GDP contraction for 3Q25. However, a rebound in September points to a gradual economic recovery in the current quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BoJ cited trade uncertainty as the reason for pausing rate hikes yesterday. However, today’s data indicates a possible economic recovery that could support future rate hikes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today’s data supports our view that the BoJ is likely to hike rates in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.
