The main drivers were a pronounced slowdown in regulated energy<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and fresh food prices, more than offsetting the acceleration in prices for recreational, cultural, and personal care services. Core inflation, which excludes fresh food and energy, remained stable at 2%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Goods prices slowed to just 0.2% year-on-year, while service inflation held steady at 2.6%, widening the gap between the two to 0.4 percentage points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today’s data confirms that the energy component remains pivotal in shaping the overall inflation trajectory. A comparison with gas and electricity prices recorded over the last two months of 2024 suggests that this base effect is unlikely to fade soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stability of core and service inflation, which are, of course, closely linked, also hints that, at the start of the third quarter, consumer demand is not accelerating, at least on the services front. This is indirectly confirmed by the October business confidence survey for the services sector, which showed a clear slowdown in price change intentions for the next three months. The same indicator for manufactured goods pointed to stable pricing intentions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, economic stagnation is bringing about a cooling of inflation that is unlikely to reverse sharply in the near term, unless there are unpredictable surprises in energy commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, we are revising down our forecast for average inflation in 2025 from 1.7% to 1.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Hopefully, you will find something valuable in this piece for yourself as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understanding eBay</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have a hard time understanding what’s going on with eBay. I went over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/16319322\">their 10-Q</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835093-ebay-inc-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">their earnings call</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835090-ebay-inc-2025-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation\">their presentation</a>, and while the results look fine, I can’t shake off the feeling that there’s something off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">eBay’s focus lately has shifted from being a platform for everything to narrowing down to its top categories, which mostly include car parts and accessories and trading cards. There are other things, of course, like handbags, sneakers, etc., but the first two seem to be the strongest either in absolute terms or in growth rate. So while I can see that these segments are growing very nicely for the company, I’m still struggling to understand what kind of business eBay really is today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1976\" data-height=\"1016\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 2025 eBay Earnings Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q3 2025 eBay Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their GMV is up by an impressive 8%, which is great, but at the same time, their gross profit margin has been going down over the last few years. So I don’t know what to make of it. The results look great, but at the same time, the overall situation is not perfect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focus Categories</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s start with the part of their business that I actually like—car parts and accessories. This is one of eBay’s biggest growth segments right now, contributing more than one percentage point to the company’s total GMV growth. They already have over 750 million listings just for parts and accessories, which makes it the largest online selection of unique auto parts in most major markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Motor parts and accessories, or P&amp;A, was our second largest contributor to GMV growth in Q3, generating more than 1 point for the overall marketplace. The introduction of easy and free returns in the U.S. continued to build upon our trusted value proposition in P&amp;A, while the cost and return rates for this program are well within our forecasted ranges. We continue to expand choice and selection in key inventory segments such as salvage and used parts, which help consumers find value at a time when many are stretched financially. Overall, we have over 750 million live P&amp;A listings, which enables us to offer the largest online selection of unique auto parts and accessories in most of our major markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Probably, I like this part of eBay’s business the most because I have an understanding of how big this market could be and how profitable it is. One of my father’s businesses back in Ukraine is a shop where they dismantle used cars and sell the parts online similarly to how eBay’s platform works. It’s a different website, but you also have sellers listing items, buyers purchasing them, and the seller shipping the parts once ordered. It’s also a huge platform back in Ukraine, and every person has heard of it and most likely used it at least once.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has been a great business in Ukraine, especially since the war started and people try to maintain their cars longer, but also before it worked out handsomely. So, I completely understand why this category does well in the U.S. as well. It’s a huge market. The population is layered, so not everyone replaces their car every few years, and the demand for affordable parts is always present.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A fact that is not directly related but interesting nonetheless: I live in Israel now, and my economics professor mentioned that Israel has one of the youngest vehicle fleets in the world. People here replace cars roughly every five years, and the used ones get shipped abroad. That’s definitely not the case in the U.S. According to Reuters, Americans now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/americans-keep-vehicles-record-126-years-average-despite-easing-supplies-sp-says-2024-05-22/#:~:text=Americans%20keep%20vehicles%20for%20record,easing%20supplies%2C%20S&amp;P%20says%20%7C%20Reuters\" rel=\"nofollow\">keep their cars</a> for a record of 12.6 years on average, which is a substantial period of time. So this part of eBay’s business makes perfect sense to me, and I actually like it a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But then there’s the other focus category—trading cards. I know this category has been growing for some time now, and I understand that there’s a collector market around it, but to me, it just sounds ridiculous. The company said that Pokémon GMV grew triple digits for the third straight quarter and that collectibles were its largest contributor to growth this time. This is something that makes me less attracted to this business, because it doesn’t sound sustainable to me personally. I genuinely can’t understand how someone can spend hundreds of dollars on a stack of cards that just sits on a shelf. Maybe it’s because I don’t have kids and don’t understand the fascination, but it just feels strange to me that one of eBay’s main growth engines depends on this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, one of the new things they have is live trading events, with celebrities like Logan Paul or NBA players joining streams on eBay Live. Possibly, I don’t understand much about the target audience or the retail business, but this business segment looks very strange to me as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me to eBay Live in general and their version of “live shopping.” I couldn’t write about it without trying it myself, and maybe it was a mistake. I thought it was bad. Again, maybe I’m not their target audience, but if this is supposed to be their big innovation, then it’s underwhelming. Each live stream has 20-80 viewers, and I don’t think it looks like a future growth driver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They said eBay Live’s GMV run rate grew 5x year-over-year, but I just don’t see it. Maybe the numbers were minuscule, and now they are slightly bigger. That would make more sense. Maybe it works better for collectibles, but even then, it just feels like the company is forcing itself into trends that don’t really fit its platform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Implementation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the growth of the stock is directly correlated with the company's AI implementation. Here, I have some mixed feelings as well, because if I can relate to one part and justify the other, some of the developments that management is very vocal about don’t sound like something that will help this company in bringing in more clients or sales, for that matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">eBay says it’s using AI for things like improving listings, powering recommendations, and even helping users search by photo. And while that all sounds nice, at the same time, it is not revolutionary. Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) has had image search for years, Pinterest, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PINS\" title=\"Pinterest, Inc.\">PINS</a>) has had visual search for years as well, and even when I knew it existed and tried it a few times, I never used it. So I am skeptical about the ability of this feature to attract more customers or to change the shopping experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s good that they’re finding ways to integrate AI, but I wouldn’t call them an “AI-driven company” because of it. Most of what they’re doing with AI just helps with listing descriptions and better recommendations. It’s an incremental improvement, which is needed, of course, to go toe-to-toe with the times, but it’s not revolutionary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They also mentioned an AI shopping agent, an agentic commerce platform, and a large language model, or LLM, ecosystem. But again, that’s not something that will change how people perceive eBay. The only genuinely interesting feature, in my opinion, is that you can describe to AI what you’re searching for and get personalized product results. That could be useful, but I tried to find it myself on the website and couldn’t even locate the feature. Maybe it’s being tested in limited regions. So while I do think this is a smart direction, and I truly believe that in the future we’ll all shop by describing what we want to an AI assistant, I just don’t see eBay as the one leading that revolution.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mixed Feelings About the Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I can recognize what eBay is doing well, I’m skeptical about how valuable it really is long-term. Their results were good—GMV up 8%, revenue up 8%, EPS up 14%, and their advertising business grew 23%. But their gross margin keeps shrinking and is now at 71.6%, down from 72.4% last year and from around 77% just a few years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company looks healthy, but profitability is slowly eroding. They returned $760 million to shareholders this quarter through buybacks and dividends. This is great, but I am still not feeling like eBay is a great buying opportunity for me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Talking about the reasons for the stock drop, it’s mostly the fact that management said that the company may face headwinds for 2025 and 2026. They guided for fourth-quarter GMV growth of only 4%–6% (GMV in Q4 at $20.5 billion–$20.9 billion) and full-year GMV of ~5% growth. They flagged that last year’s trading cards and bullion surge created tough comparables, dragging future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They also warned that elimination of the U.S. “de minimis” import exemption (meaning smaller cross-border parcels are now subject to tariffs) and other trade- and shipping-friction issues create structural headwinds for their cross-border business. Even though they say revenue and GMV will “grow positively,” the company admitted margin pressure will persist due to investments in shipping solutions, live commerce, and AI-agent platforms, plus interest expense drag from lower cash balances.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s also interesting is that despite all of this, the company still trades at a relatively high valuation compared to its own history. Its current P/E ratio is around 15x, while its 5-year average is closer to 12x. For a secondhand marketplace with declining margins, that doesn’t look like a stock at a meaningful discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So while eBay is performing well financially, I can’t say that I would buy the stock at these levels. It’s not an AI company, and it’s not the future of e-commerce. It’s a decent business that found some stable niches, but nothing that makes me think it will change the world. If nothing groundbreaking is happening, why would this stock trade at a much higher multiple?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, to sum it up, I see the good, I see the effort, and I even see smart decisions. But I also see a company trying to present itself as something it’s not. And I just can’t convince myself that these “AI” features, or live shopping experiments, or trading cards, are the foundation of long-term value for eBay Inc. For me, this company is simply okay.</p>",

As discussed in our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809627-palantir-vs-navitas-diverging-fundamentals-converging-valuations\">previous coverage</a> on the stock, its valuation upsurge is not only a result of mere AI hype. Instead, it<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> reflects reward for Palantir’s consistent delivery of tangible progress in scaling profitability, as its Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”) accelerates capitalization on emerging secular opportunities. This is corroborated by the company’s two consecutive quarters of raised full year 2025 revenue guidance, which now reflects </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808502-palantir-technologies-inc-pltr-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">45% y/y growth</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> at the midpoint to $4.146 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-palantir-ai-enterprise-data-intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnership</a> to integrate AIP with Nvidia’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) tech stack has only reinforced optimism over Palantir’s AI monetization strategy. Momentum in the current quarter is also supported by Palantir’s increasing traction in government opportunities – especially in Europe, where accelerating adoption is helping narrow its international operations’ growth gap from core U.S. public sector opportunities. Specifically, U.S. government opportunities have been a key driver of Palantir’s acceleration this year, thanks to the favourable defense tech spending environment under the Trump administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, the developments continue to bolster Palantir’s translation of imminent secular AI tailwinds into tangible demand visibility and scalability, underpinning durability to its valuation trajectory. The following analysis will explore defining questions that will drive Palantir’s upcoming Q3 earnings results—including the growth trajectory that the market is pricing into Palantir’s 268x estimated earnings multiple, and whether its execution across the commercial and government segments is consistent with those expectations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Does The Market Expect From Palantir? </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following its eye-watering upsurge this year, the stock’s become one of the most expensive at 268x estimated earnings and 98x estimated sales. Within the software peer group, Clearwater Analytics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CWAN\" title=\"Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc.\">CWAN</a>) has the most comparable forward growth outlook (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CWAN/earnings/estimates\">2025E</a>: +61% y/y; 2026E: +30% y/y) to Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR/earnings/estimates\">2025E</a>: +45% y/y; 2026E: +35% y/y). Yet Clearwater Analytics trades at a much lower multiple of 31x forward earnings and 6x forward sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main difference is in the durability of their respective multi-year growth and earnings accretion trajectories. Clearwater Analytics’ growth outlook is expected to decelerate into the high-teens percentage range by 2027, representing a 19% five-year CAGR through 2030. This compares with Palantir’s 36% five-year CAGR over the same period based on current consensus estimates. Meanwhile, Clearwater Analytics’ earnings outlook, though robust, also pales in comparison to Palantir’s. The company is expected to expand earnings at a 24% five-year CAGR through 2030, versus Palantir’s 35% over the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly highlights the market’s optimism for Palantir’s unmatched scalability, which is critical for cash flow accretion underpinning the stock’s valuation outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To further gauge the durability of Palantir’s premium valuation multiple given its current estimates, we’ve also performed a reverse discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. This is performed to gauge whether the pace of revenue and earnings growth predictions are supportive of an intrinsic value that aligns with Palantir’s current valuation multiple premium on a relative basis to peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similar to our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809627-palantir-vs-navitas-diverging-fundamentals-converging-valuations\">last</a> reverse DCF analysis performed on the stock, key valuation assumptions considered include a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% applied on projected 2035 cash flow to firm (i.e., EBITDA + change in net working capital + cash taxes) in determining Palantir’s terminal value. The perpetual growth rate of 3.5% is in line with the anticipated pace of long-term economic expansion across Palantir’s core operating regions (i.e., U.S. and allied regions). This accordingly reflects the rate at which its steady-state cash flows – which is proxied by 2035 projections consistent with the anticipated timeline to a mature business cycle – can sustainably expand at over the longer-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reverse DCF analysis also considers a 9.0% WACC, which is used to discount the cash flow projections and estimated terminal value over a 10-year forecast period to determine Palantir’s enterprise value. Net debt – which in Palantir’s case is its cash balance due to nil borrowings – is added back to arrive at its equity value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming Palantir maintains a similar pace of quarterly margin expansion as observed over the past two years, underpinned by AIP’s rapid scalability alongside complementary improvements to operating leverage, the stock’s current price at ~$195 per share (October 30 close) implies a multi-year revenue and earnings growth trajectory of at least 35% and 44%, respectively:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"286\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Palantir valuation analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"195\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

This corroborates that Palantir’s premium valuation multiple on a relative basis to peers is currently supported by the intrinsic value of its cash flow projections.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Is This Multi-Year Growth Trajectory Supported By Recent Developments?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe the recent developments at Palantir reinforce demand visibility that corroborates current growth estimates underpinning its valuation, both on a relative (i.e. multiple-based) and intrinsic (i.e., DCF) basis:</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Palantir Integration With Nvidia Tech Stack</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this week, Palantir announced that its proprietary Ontology – the digital replica of an organization that underpins Foundry, Gotham, and AIP’s insight-driving capabilities – will integrate Nvidia’s AI tech stack. This will allow Ontology access to Nvidia’s AI models and accelerated compute power to further address enterprise AI needs, and bolster Palantir’s penetration into related commercial opportunities – especially in the industrial vertical, given their complex supply chains and need for dynamic systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the industrial vertical is inherently low-margin due to its capital intensity. Yet AI is able to <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/customer-stories/siemens-accelerates-product-development-and-innovation-with-industrial-ai/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-707332&amp;_bt=771598777624&amp;_bk=industrial%20digitalization&amp;_bm=p&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=185377347740&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22958834872&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4XAoHES2kOH6uqpqN9_QY0dZ-ww&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmYzIBhC6ARIsAHA3IkTiyt6cAV5HvemPA8WM435M14ujooAFTaEtuvZXp6RiV5qZAtF6AkcaAm2IEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow\">unlock</a> greater product efficiency and better decision-making, enabling productivity gains (e.g., reduced downtime; supply chain optimization) that can have a tangible impact on industrials’ scalability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly makes industrials a key emerging vertical for AI application. As part of a recent industry survey, only about 21% of respondents have cited adoption of industrial AI solutions, while almost half expect implementation over the next three years, driven by supply chain optimization needs. The emerging opportunity is also consistent with current <a href=\"https://iot-analytics.com/industrial-ai-market-insights-how-ai-is-transforming-manufacturing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">industry estimates</a> for the industrial AI market opportunity to exceed $150 billion in value by 2030, representing a 23% CAGR from about $44 billion in 2024. This accordingly highlights the significant growth headroom for Palantir’s commercial AIP monetization in the industrial vertical. And the recent collaboration with Nvidia is expected to further Palantir’s reach into said opportunity, as it’s expected to unlock further optimization critical for the industrial end-market. It’s also expected to complement Palantir’s <a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/warpspeed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warp Speed</a> operating system optimized for manufacturing and industrial verticals, which further reinforces its longer-term commercial demand visibility.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Expanding Europe Footprint</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.K. has been consistently a key growth driver for Palantir’s international business – especially in public sector opportunities in recent quarters. And recent developments are expected to further expand Palantir’s international government momentum, as it bolsters reach into additional European opportunities:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>£1.5 Billion U.K. Investment: </strong>Earlier last month, Palantir announced its pledge of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-strategic-partnership-to-unlock-billions-and-boost-military-ai-and-innovation\" rel=\"nofollow\">£1.5 billion</a> towards U.K. investments by 2030, targeting the development of next-generation AI defense technologies. It’s also been awarded a £750 million, five-year contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defense to deploy its proprietary AI-enabled defense technology. This is expected to extend the company’s current momentum in the region’s public sector opportunities, and drive further accretion to government segment growth.</li> <li> <strong>Hadean Partnership: </strong>Palantir announced its <a href=\"https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2025/Palantir-and-Hadean-Partner-to-Bring-a-Suite-of-Simulation-and-AI-Products-Across-the-UK-Armed-Forces/\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnership</a> with Hadean, a leading U.K. defense tech provider, earlier this month. The collaboration is expected to further Palantir’s share of defense AI tech spend in the region beyond direct engagements acquired through U.K. Ministry of Defense contracts.</li> <li> <strong>Letter of Intent with Poland Ministry of National Defense: </strong>Palantir and Poland’s Defense Ministry has signed a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/poland-signs-palantir-anduril-deals-amid-record-army-spending\" rel=\"nofollow\">letter of intent</a> earlier this week to support the agency’s expansion of its data, AI, and cybersecurity capabilities. This accordingly reinforces Palantir’s foray in Europe public sector opportunities—a region that CEO Alex Karp has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781960-palantir-technologies-inc-pltr-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">long criticized</a> for its slow development and adoption of AI software. Specifically, Poland is expecting $55 billion in defense spending next year, which represents 5% of its GDP – the <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/05/polands-president-vows-to-spend-47-of-gdp-on-defence-this-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">largest</a> allocation among NATO constituents.</li> <li> <strong>NATO Adoption of Maven Smart System: </strong>Earlier this year, NATO <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/05/polands-president-vows-to-spend-47-of-gdp-on-defence-this-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">adopted</a> Palantir’s proprietary Maven Smart System. This represents a critical “landing” deal for Palantir, as it gains access to “deploy its AI mission command solution across [NATO’s] 32 member states.” True to Palantir’s “land and expand” business model, the NATO partnership is a critical step towards further penetration of opportunities across Europe, and increased visibility into its international government segment’s long-term growth trajectory. This was likely a precursor to the recent letter of intent signed with Poland, signaling confidence in continued adoption of Palantir’s defense tech offerings among U.S. allies in Europe.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>U.S. Policy Support</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Palantir has emerged as one of the leading defense tech firms as the U.S. Army undergoes modernization. This has been further bolstered by the Trump administration’s policy support. Specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\" rel=\"nofollow\">One Big Beautiful Act Bill</a> now includes significant allocations towards defense spending, with “<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/will-trumps-big-beautiful-defense-spending-last\" rel=\"nofollow\">tens of billions of dollars</a> in funding for innovation priorities.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent commentary from the U.S. Army Chief Information Officer, Leonel Garciga, has also reaffirmed Palantir’s “foundational” role in the agency’s AI strategy:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Palantir is a core platform for business capabilities and readiness right now, to lay the foundation for some of the AI work that we want to do across the Army.</p> <p><em>Source: U.S. Army CIO Leonel Garciga, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/palantir-rebuts-claims-of-security-flaws-after-stock-falls\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg News</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly creates a favourable backdrop for Palantir, as long-term U.S. government opportunities represent a key growth driver for the business. The company’s increasingly entrenched role in bolstering the U.S. Army’s AI ecosystem is also expected to complement its moat in defense tech, and reinforce its reach into international opportunities among allied regions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Resilient Enterprise AI Software Spending</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Palantir’s U.S. commercial operations represent its leading growth driver. The unit delivered 93% y/y revenue growth in Q2, complemented by continued acceleration in commercial-driven remaining performance obligations at 77% y/y growth during the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly provides strong accretion required to maintain the 36%+ multi-year growth trajectory currently priced into Palantir’s valuation. And the momentum is expected to stay resilient, given strong indicators of enterprise AI software spending ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A recent <a href=\"https://www.rbcinsight.com/WM/share/ResearchViewer/?YYY340_a0lQ3LRaZh+1NpNJQbmxHwVAUZMEcrwPLGtNKcq+bZcVRjN4GR75hg==&amp;a=a\" rel=\"nofollow\">CIO survey</a> conducted by RBC Capital Markets shows that software will represent the bulk of near-term IT budgets. Almost all surveyed respondents have indicated expectations for increased software spend through the year, with the majority of allocations designated towards “AI and cybersecurity, followed by Data Warehouse, Analytics, and BI and Database and IT Service Management software” – a strong tailwind for Palantir as it continues to scale AIP deployment in the commercial sector:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"752\" data-height=\"496\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with numbers and percentagesAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" width=\"640\" height=\"422\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>RBC Capital Markets</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Can Go Wrong?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looming macroeconomic uncertainties remain the key overhang for Palantir, as it directly interferes with the enterprise IT spending environment. However, as discussed in the earlier section, AI spending – which Palantir is a key beneficiary of – remains resilient. This is further reinforced by AI-promised productivity gains, which can help businesses – particularly those in capital-intensive industrial and manufacturing verticals – preserve margins amid adverse cost pressures stemming from ongoing tariff uncertainties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another downside risk facing Palantir is its increasing exposure to political controversies. For instance, the company has been outspoken about its support for Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. It’s also played a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">key role</a> in supporting the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown efforts. Both of which have been controversial topics in which Americans have been divided on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the latest development, Palantir’s Head of Global Communications, Lisa Gordon, has also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/palantir-trump-karp-politics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">identified</a> the company’s “political shift toward the Trump administration [as] concerning”. From an operating perspective, this could risk boycotts and lead to adverse implications on its commercial segment growth outlook. Similar challenges have been recently observed at companies like <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/10/27/elon-musks-politics-cost-tesla-over-1-million-sales-us-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tesla</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/02/elon-musk-netflix-trans-character-dead-end-paranormal-park\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netflix</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-suffers-concerning-loss-massive-013700303.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disney</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>), as their political views conflict with demand drivers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, there is tangible support for Palantir’s current valuation, despite the significant premium on a relative basis to peers. Recent developments – spanning the integration of AIP with Nvidia’s AI tech stack, accelerating adoption across U.S. and international governments, and resilient enterprise software spending allocations – reinforce visibility into Palantir’s multi-year, high growth trajectory, which strengthens its prospects for sustained margin expansion at scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the company’s expanding collaborations with U.S. allies, such as NATO, alongside its deepening partnerships with enterprise leaders further skew its opportunities to the upside. Not only do these newly secured relationships represent standalone opportunities, but they also provide validation to Palantir’s technologies, and signal incremental avenues for growth expansion and market share penetration headroom – aligning closely with its land-and-expand business model.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coupled with resilience in the enterprise IT spending environment, alongside favourable policy support for defense tech modernization, Palantir enters its upcoming Q3 earnings update in a position of strength. Fundamentally, the company also continues to deliver tangible financial progress, underpinned by consistent revenue acceleration and operating leverage improvements. This accordingly enhances durability to its valuation trajectory, while keeping investors’ optimism over the company’s long-term AI moat intact.</p>",

There’s one more big headline<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> this week worth paying attention to: the shareholder vote on CoreWeave, Inc.’s (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">CRWV</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) acquisition of Core Scientific, Inc. (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CORZ\" title=\"Core Scientific, Inc.\">CORZ</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consistent with our expectations, CoreWeave <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511462-core-scientific-fails-to-get-enough-votes-for-coreweave-deal\">did not receive</a> the requisite number of votes for the acquisition to pass. The stock gained over 6% on the news, intra-trading on Thursday. The failed acquisition isn't all that surprising, given the trajectory of events heading into Thursday's vote, with proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS advising against it (reports that CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator called it disappointing). We think this is the best thing that could've happened to Core Scientific and see a big opportunity in Core Scientific on its fall-through.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Details of CoreWeave’s $9B bid for Core Scientific &amp; why today's news is good:</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CoreWeave, Wall Street’s favorite neocloud baby, announced back in June its intention to acquire Core Scientific in a $9B all-stock deal. Upon closing, Core Scientific stockholders would receive 0.1235 newly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4507210-coreweave-ceo-calls-on-core-scientific-shareholders-to-back-acquisition-under-current-terms\">issued</a> shares of CoreWeave Class A common stock. Back in June, neither stock reacted well to the news, with CoreWeave dropping 3% and Core Scientific pulling back 18%. The less-than-impressed reaction was not on the acquisition itself as much as it was about the $9B price tag, undervaluing Core Scientific and working more in favor of CoreWeave, plus concerns over ownership dilution with more shares. The deal would shave off $10B in future lease obligations for CoreWeave, according to the acquisition presentation. The way CoreWeave CEO put it: “We’re not paying rent, right, for the next 15 years.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For reference, CoreWeave is already Core Scientific's largest customer, so CoreWeave would essentially be buying its landlord, saving on rent for years to come. So, CoreWeave would be securing an AI fuel line that’ll enable it to enter more lease agreements, similar to the $14B AI infrastructure deal we saw with Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) last month. It would also be a relatively easy way for CoreWeave to secure extra capacity without high cost; in fact, Core Scientific’s vertical integration is expected to result in $500M in annual cost savings by the end of 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This wouldn’t be too bad of a setup, if not for the fact that Core Scientific’s external opportunity is outpacing the one associated with this deal. Core Scientific sits on approximately 1.3 GW of gross power capacity, of which 840 MW is allocated to CoreWeave and 250 MW of billable IT capacity remains available, with potential expansion for an additional 1 GW. In comparison, Applied Digital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APLD\" title=\"Applied Digital Corporation\">APLD</a>) has about 800 MW across Polaris Forge 1 and 2, and is already leasing out capacity within the development pipeline. The capacity Core Scientific has is notable and has been overshadowed by acquisition concerns this year. We expect investors to recognize Core Scientific's standalone potential now that the deal is off the table, as there is greater value in its uncontracted power capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific also reported its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508526-core-scientific-gaap-eps-of-0_46-misses-by-0_43-revenue-of-81_1m\">Q3 '25 results</a> during the week, with revenue of $81.1M, up from $78.6M last quarter but down from $95.4M in the year-ago quarter, with a contracted net loss of $146.7M versus $455.3M in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $3.9M, up from a loss of $0.2M a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We think the top line isn’t moving due to the weight of the shift to high-density colocation business (HPC hosting or HDC), allocating more capacity to HPC over mining bitcoin. This quarter, the bitcoin mined dropped 55%, and the average bitcoin price (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) increased 88%. HDC sales were up 45.6% Q/Q to $10.3M, while bitcoin-mining business sales were $66.1M, down 22% Y/Y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market didn’t react too well to the results, but we believe they confirm that management is continuing the push toward AI infrastructure leasing and away from bitcoin. The only concern we have is about the trajectory of CapEx if the acquisition does not go through, considering that $196.4 of the $244.5 was funded by CoreWeave. What eases our concern is that we don't see CoreWeave stepping back from funding the shift toward HDC, considering it remains reliant on Core Scientific capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our thesis on Core Scientific isn’t risk-free. This could place risk on their future positioning with CoreWeave, although that cannot be proved or disproved this early. What we do know is that CoreWeave is likely already looking for another bitcoin mining turned AI infrastructure play to buy because the cost of converting a cryptocurrency site is lower than setting up a whole new campus. We expect shareholders will focus less on Intrator and more on Core Scientific’s standalone potential value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is cheap compared to the potential premium</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The digital infrastructure landlord scene has evolved very quickly, and it’s looking more attractive for Core Scientific to join its bitcoin mining-turned-AI infrastructure peer group in the opportunity of securing lease agreements beyond CoreWeave. The results of Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) and Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) after the bell on Wednesday confirm that CapEx spend focused on AI build-out is expanding, and Core Scientific is uniquely positioned to benefit as an unrealized, high-capacity option. Applied Digital and IREN (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IREN\" title=\"IREN Limited\">IREN</a>), for example, are monetizing the opportunity, building out capacity, and the stock price is reflecting it, as shown below, while Core Scientific is underperforming the peer group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w640\" alt=\"sklfjdsljf\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"507\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific stock has run up recently to its 52-week high on the deal's failure, hitting $22.12 per share. RSI is almost 69, heading toward overbought territory. Valuation-wise, the stock remains attractive in our opinion. The stock trades at a forward EV/Sales of 17.93x against a group average of 3.61x, which looks high at first until checking the more direct peer group, shown below on the six-month chart. Core Scientific’s premium is arguably negligible against the premium it could go into if it realizes more lease agreements on its power potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w640\" alt=\"kasldfjskld\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"490\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line:</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a kind of caterpillar turning into a butterfly scenario, and we’re here at the right time.

I'm Daniel Snyder from Seeking Alpha. Today, we're jumping into conversation with Michael Del Monte, but we're taking things interstellar. We are diving into an article he wrote just earlier a few months ago about ARKX. That is The Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF. I have so many questions. But before we dive-in, Michael, welcome to the show. You've been writing for Seeking Alpha for a little while here. Why Space? What made this ETF pop-up on your radar?</p> <p><strong>Michael Del Monte</strong>: Yeah. It's great to chat with you on the show. Looking forward to the conversation. And, Space is such an interesting and unique concept for investing. You have this large pool of investments that's finally coming back to Earth and no pun intended on that, but there's just a lot of interest right now whether it's for aerospace and defense or for the defense industry or for just satellite communications and just like offshore oil. You have so much money being invested in Space right now. It's just incredible time to be in the industry.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So, we're going to dive into a couple of the catalysts that you have mentioned to me before, but you wrote this article back in August, and this ETF's up about 16.29% is what I'm seeing here on Seeking Alpha since you wrote that. So, obviously been doing pretty well even though we've been going through weird times in the macro environment.</p> <p>Obviously, the administration stuff has that going on, tariffs. Things are being re-moved all around the world for supply chains. It seems like in Space, also you have a lot of money that's in the private equity side of thing. And that's been a whole topic of conversation is, well, we can't always get access to what's going on. I know a lot of people think about Starlink or what Jeff Bezos is doing. And all these people are working on Space, but we can't usually get access to that unless you're an accredited investor, right? So, this ETF that ARK put together, we'd love to hear your rundown. I mean, what do you think about the expense ratio at 75 basis points? I mean, the assets under management are $522 million. You had mentioned stuff about this being high beta names within the portfolio. Can you give the investors listening today just a little bit of rundown?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, just at a high level, 75 basis points, that's a normal range for a more thematic type ETF. For an index fund, you might see something quite a bit lower like Charles Schwab or Vanguard is going to be 3 basis points for something that's leveraged. You're going to look at 150 basis points. So, for thematic equity ETF, 75 isn't too terrible of an expense.</p> <p>As far as, like, the high-beta theme, you're looking at companies that are in that high growth stage, going back to the private equity side, that you discussed. A lot of companies are pretty new, pretty innovative, and a lot of them are still pre-revenue. So, they're building up all these expenses, building the technology, whether it's rocket ships, whether it's satellite communications, or whatever it may be related to Space. They're in the development phase, they're in the testing phase, they're in the early stages of revenue or pre-revenue even. So, it's, you don't have a lot to value these companies based on. You don't have earnings, you don't have free cash flow to look at. So, you just basing your assumptions on what the potential growth is going to be for these companies.</p> <p>So, it can result in quite a volatile market for one of them. You're going to see a lot of momentum trading going on within the ETF, within the individual stocks. So, it can lead to, some pretty significant movements relative to the broader market.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So, let's talk about some other names, right. Rocket Lab Corp, Kratos, L3Harris Technologies, Teradyne, Archer Aviation, Palantir, Advanced Micro Devices. I mean, there's more in here that I think they're up to 33 holdings within this ETF right now, but as you were mentioning, some of them are looking for that next level of growth, right? So, we've been having the track Palantir and AMD. Like, some of those make sense to me, but then you have Archer Aviation, Rocket Lab, they seem a little bit more foreign. So, where is the growth? Where is the revenue coming from for the companies like that?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, it's really interesting. I think the ETF it has a pretty good balance between I'll call it more traditional but larger aerospace companies that might be more established. And then you have like the newcomers like Rocket Lab, and these guys. So, it's like a balanced type approach to building the strategy. AMD, that's I don't want to call it a no brainer, but it provides a little bit of a baseline, I'll say, for stability.</p> <p>The company's semiconductors, they can be put into satellites. It can be put into whatever you want into the rockets, whatever. So, there's some versatility in there. It's not like they're putting a GPU in the portfolio just because it's the cool thing right now. Palantir, there was a conversation to where the software would be utilized for the Golden Dome project, which is that big satellite project, the defense satellite system that is designed to be a larger scale version of the Iron Dome in Israel.</p> <p>So, it's essentially pulling in a ton of companies and their technology, whether it's laser systems, whether it's propulsion systems, whatever it may be. Pulling in all these companies to integrate this large scale defense system to essentially defend against hypersonic missiles. So, it seems like it's more broad than it is, but it all ties together at the end of the day.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So, for Golden Dome though, like, what is, from what your research has presented you, what's the timeline on that? Are we talking that this is like a one year project that these companies are going to see hyper growth on their earnings and their balance sheets and everything else? Or is this, like, multi years, if not decades? Like, we have a dream for a project. It might work. It might not. Of course, we know Iron Dome, but, I mean, you go to space, you're talking about completely different physics up there.</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. You have a bunch of satellites floating around and trying to communicate…</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Once they crashed to Earth, almost every week now as well just because they're being decommissioned, right. So, it's like, what's the timeline there? What should investors actually be thinking about? Like, is this going to be in the next few quarters? Are we talking about year-over-year?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, honestly, that's hard to say. There's no definitive timeline that has been presented at this point as far as I'm aware, but it's a $175 billion project last time I checked, at least to get it up and running and started. As far as the investing horizon goes, it's probably going to take quite a few years just to get the project plan mapped out, who's building what and integrating what into what.</p> <p>So, it's not like you have one company building the, let's say, detection satellites. It's going to be a group of companies building that one component of the satellite. And then you have, like, more of the defense satellites, ones that are being designed to be equipped with directed energy or lasers, to shoot down hypersonic missiles, which are missiles that were, I think they were illegal to be built some years ago, and then the U.S. found out China was developing them. So, it was an uh-oh moment where we need to develop this technology, we need to develop countermeasures, things like that. So, it's one of those things where it needs to be defended against.</p> <p>So, it's going to be quite a long time horizon as far as I'm aware. You're going to look at 5, 10 years to really get things up and running, probably going to be longer. You're probably going to have ongoing maintenance. How long does the satellite have in Space before it needs to be decommissioned and replaced? Like, what was it, like, 10 years or so? It's not that long of a lifetime, when you consider the holistic part of it. So, it's going to be something that you're going to have your large scale investment upfront over the next couple years.</p> <p>You're probably going to have like that testing phase revenue where you get a grant for testing out that technology. You're going to get to the next round of grants to integrate it. It's just an ongoing process for space and defense, projects like that. So, we're probably looking at quite a few years before big money really sets in.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Okay. And then you had also mentioned to me before, Artemis program and artificial intelligence and how those might support this ETF specifically. What's the cases there?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, Artemis is quite an interesting project where NASA is essentially looking to land and build a development on the moon or I think it's on the – what is it? The South Pole or the dark side of the moon? Not to - or Pink Floyd there, but, they're looking to build an establishment, an autonomous site on the moon to essentially act as a midpoint, so to speak, to get to deeper space.</p> <p>So, when you launch a rocket to get to space, it used up quite a bit of fuel and resources just to get out of the first atmosphere. So, building that, I guess, moon base is going to be like that refueling station. You're taking your spaceship to the gas station to be able to get further out without having to deal with another layer of intense gravity.</p> <p>So, it's an interesting project. I believe it's had a few delays here and there. Intuitive Machine was one of the companies that was a part of it. They made big headlines the other year with their lander or rover not landing upright and then essentially running out of energy after some time.</p> <p>So, it's an interesting project, a little complex from what it looks like, but it's something that is moving along. What was the other question?</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Also, we've talked about artificial intelligence would also probably benefit this ETF because of the names like AMD, right? For example. So, wanted to ask you before we wrapped up here, on your article back in August, you said, I reiterate my Buy rating, but advise reducing ARKX exposure as a percentage of a portfolio to manage risk and maintain diversification. And that was north of 16% ago or your 16% return you've had since then. The ETF price from when we're recording this is hovering near $31 a share. I got to ask you now, now there's been a few months, are you still a Buy? Are you still reducing exposure? There's been a lot of changes in the macro environment. What are your thoughts now? Where do you stand with the rating on this ETF?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Absolutely. So, it still stands at a Buy. Circling back to our conversation earlier about high-beta names, you have the Federal Reserve that's actively, expect – well, they're expected. I don't want to say they're actively because they can change their minds at any time, but they're expected to reduce the interest rate by two incremental cuts throughout the rest of the year. So, two 25 basis point cuts throughout the rest of the year. And then, it seems like they're going to be cutting one more time in 2026, depending on the macro data, which isn't currently coming out with the government shutdown aside from CPI this last week.</p> <p>We could see more cuts. We could see a lot of things change between now and next year. So, in correlation with high-beta stocks, they typically do exceptionally well during interest rate cuts. You have lower cost of financing. You need that alternative to receive yield. So, you can expect or you can typically expect high-beta stocks to do pretty well during periods of lower cost of capital.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Alright. So, you're saying risk on. Alright. Thank you so much, Michael. Everyone, thank you for watching this episode. If you haven't already, go follow Michael on Seeking Alpha. Go to his author profile. He has hundreds and hundreds of different pieces of analysis that he's published. He's publishing new ones all the time, long term focus and stuff like this. So, like, unique ETF. I love it because not a lot of people focus on the Space side of things. For some people, I know it just feels like a dream that's a little bit too far or not there yet, but that's what makes it exciting to me.</p> <p>So, Michael, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Everyone, this has been another episode of ETF Spotlight. I'm Daniel Snyder, and we'll see you next week.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3LhzXon\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Follow Michael Del Monte on Seeking Alpha!</a></strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p><strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3JABe9w\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Follow ARKX on Seeking Alpha!</a></strong></p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI\" title=\"Super Micro Computer, Inc.\">SMCI</a></span>) stock had a few tough weeks after dropping from around $60 to $50. Nevertheless, the stock is still around 9% more expensive than it was when I wrote my previous bullish <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812674-super-micro-computer-ai-champion-priced-for-distress\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">writeup</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.

Some indications suggest that SMCI's share price might experience a bumpy road post-earnings. However, the stock is too cheap, and its long-term potential is too strong to ignore. Therefore, I continue buying before earnings and will double down in case of a post-earnings dip. Therefore, my take on SMCI is still Strong Buy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamental analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer releases its FQ1 2026 earnings next week, November 4th. The stock price already suffered during this earnings season when it dropped by 4% in one day after last week's quarterly sales report revealed a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4507518-super-micro-drops-after-q1-sales-results-miss-estimate-by-nearly-15b\">$1.5 billion massive revenue miss</a>. However, this miss was more kind of noisy headline rather than the company's fundamental problem. The reason is the management's strategic decision to upgrade design wins, which just means that the company hasn't lost these $1.5 billion of this fiscal year's sales but moved it to the next quarter. Therefore, from the perspective of the FY2026 revenue potential, nothing has changed much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"862\" data-height=\"345\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is still expected to double its revenue between FY2026 and FY2031, according to the above forecast from consensus. And I think that this long-term optimism is not only due to the strength of AI adoption momentum but also because of SMCI's proven ability to capitalize on massive data center tailwinds. There is a 45%+ CAGR demonstrated over the five years across all key financial metrics, which is the number one reason I believe that SMCI is extremely strong in absorbing data center tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"969\" data-height=\"431\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not because of just some luck but thanks to the management's firm commitment to strengthen SMCI's strategic positioning in the new era. I've already mentioned SMCI's growing investments in CAPEX and R&amp;D in my previous coverages. Today, let's talk about more qualitative factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509479-supermicro-teams-up-with-intel-micron-to-set-record-breaking-results-for-quantitative-trading\">struck new partnerships</a> with semiconductor giants like Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) and Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) to achieve \"record-breaking results for quantitative trading benchmarks.\" This is expansion into a new area for SMCI, which can have a potentially huge impact over the long term. According to <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/ter01-piecing-together-the-127-trillion-global-stock-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visual Capitalist</a>, the global stock market is worth $127 trillion. And it is only the stock market, while there are other enormous markets using automated trading, like commodities and foreign exchange. Succeeding with this new partnership might open great growth opportunities for SMCI over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another large and thriving area where SMCI <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510241-super-micro-ceo-unveils-expansion-into-federal-market\">recently announced</a> it is expanding into is the federal market, with initiatives to support digitalization of the U.S. government. This is quite promising because the U.S. government is the world's by far largest spender, with its annual budget of <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\" rel=\"nofollow\">around $7 trillion</a>. Of course, just a portion of the budget will be allocated to digitalization projects where SMCI can potentially participate. However, modernization of the government and making it more efficient and streamlined is one of the President Trump's top priorities, meaning that we might see some large, interesting projects in this domain as well over the next three years. To improve its chances to win large contracts with the U.S. government, the company currently collaborates with Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) to improve and tailor its offerings to make them a better fit <a href=\"https://www.supermicro.com/en/pressreleases/supermicro-expands-collaboration-nvidia-and-strengthens-compliance-data-integrity-and\" rel=\"nofollow\">for government applications</a>. I think that it is difficult to argue that having Nvidia in your corner is a great asset, which increases your chances of succeeding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A few weeks ago, the company also announced that it now has <a href=\"https://www.supermicro.com/en/pressreleases/supermicro-introduces-new-business-line-data-center-building-block-solutions-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">a new business line</a>, which is the Data Center Building Block Solutions (\"DCBBS\") division. According to the management, this step is aimed at expanding SMCI's reach and cover smaller clients as well. This looks like a logical strategic step to increase long-term revenue growth potential because SMCI has been already successful in working with large clients. Therefore, expanding into the area of smaller players with their DCBBS solutions will likely work well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer's forward P/E ratio setup looks bullish. SMCI's forecasted FY2027 forward P/E ratio of just 15 is unfairly low given the company's rapid revenue growth and proven record of capitalizing on AI tailwinds. The forecasted dramatic P/E contraction means that Wall Street analysts expect solid EPS growth over the next three years despite competitive pressures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1117\" data-height=\"516\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"296\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward P/E ratio setup is not the only reason why I am confident that SMCI is significantly undervalued.

It is not physically possible to examine the ratios of all AI stocks without exception, but I think it is highly likely that none of the AI-exposed stocks are traded that cheaply from the perspective of the P/S ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1115\" data-height=\"266\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"153\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618866338753135_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI could have deserved such a low P/S ratio if it was a distressed company with tanking profitability or drowning in debt.

I think so because there is stability in this ratio at the moment if we compare the TTM basis to the last five years' average. Therefore, to figure out SMCI's fair value as a business, I think that multiplying 1.4 by the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/earnings/estimates?period=annual\">$32.2 billion FY2026 revenue forecast</a> from consensus is a fair approach. The result of this multiplication is $45 billion, meaning there is a compelling 45% upside potential for the next twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mitigating factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since we are speaking about SMCI mostly in the context of the upcoming earnings release, I think that the biggest risk at the moment is failing to deliver a strong EPS surprise. As we already said, the public already knows about the revenue miss from the preliminary results release, and this factor was already absorbed by the market. However, the market also has expectations around SMCI's EPS, and missing this one might adversely affect the share price post-earnings. I am cautious in this respect because SMCI's EPS surprise record is not the best, frankly speaking. Three misses over the last five quarters means that the win rate is below 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1543\" data-height=\"573\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk of SMCI not delivering the expected FQ1 2026 EPS performance might be high, which I see from the ultra-conservative 5.6% upside potential suggested by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">Wall Street analysts</a>.

While the current RSI of around 48 is not that bad from the overbought/oversold perspective, I do not like the extremely sharp decline in this metric since early October. If we look at the last 12-month chart, we can see that SMCI's 14-day RSI did not recover fast after such sharp declines. With investors' excitement sliding down, it might be difficult for the stock to soar post-earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite potentially bumpy road for Super Micro Computer, Inc. stock next week after the earnings release, I keep accumulating this deeply undervalued AI gem.

This will be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508501-american-water-works-essential-utilities-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal\">a huge merger</a> within the U.S. water utility space.</p> <p>I've been a long-time Essential Utilities shareholder<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> within my buy-and-hold portfolio. So, I've been taking a fresh look at WTRG stock to decide what to do with that position ahead of the potential merger.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Some Essential Utilities Shareholders Are Displeased</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've seen some people that seem frustrated with this deal offer. That's understandable due to the limited premium and the firms' respective dividend policies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">American Water Works is offering a roughly 10% premium to where Essential Utilities had been trading prior to the deal announcement. However, there's a catch there. Specifically, this is an all stock purchase, with American Water Works offering 0.305 shares of AWK stock per share of WTRG stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The issue here is that American Water Works stock has traded down by roughly the same amount as the stated premium, meaning that there's been no net benefit to Essential Utilities shareholders because the value of the acquiring company has decreased. Here's a chart showing this in action:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a 10% deal premium and an 11% drop in AWK stock over the past week, any benefit from the acquisition announcement has been effectively offset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, WTRG stock is actually trading down about 6% since the deal was announced. That's likely because the deal isn't expected to close until the beginning of 2027, so there is a time value of money component to consider as well as it relates to potential merger arbitrage trades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second factor that has irritated some Essential Utilities investors is that the dividend from AWK stock is significantly lower than the dividend from WTRG stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, American Water Works has had a lower dividend yield than Essential Utilities for virtually all of the past decade, with the gap widening notably more recently:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, WTRG stock is offering a 3.36% dividend yield compared to AWK stock's 2.45% yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, for investors that let their WTRG stock convert into AWK shares once the deal closes, this amounts to a sort of backdoor dividend cut. To put specific numbers to it, Essential Utilities currently pays out $1.37 per share in annual dividends. At the proposed conversion rate of 0.305 shares of American Water Works per Essential Utilities share, investors would receive $1.01 per share in annual dividends from the 0.305 shares of AWK stock that they will be given as merger consideration. That's a meaningful reduction in dividend income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why The Deal Makes Sense</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's not all bad news, as far as this merger goes, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clear positive is that the combined company will be far and away the largest privately-run water utility in the United States. American Water Works already serves millions of people across 14 states, with that set to jump to 17 states once this deal closes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's notable that there are no other U.S. publicly-traded water utilities with a market cap of more than $3 billion. American Water Works' market cap is around $26 billion with Essential Utilities coming in second at $11 billion. The next biggest is <strong>American States Water</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWR\" title=\"American States Water Company\">AWR</a>) at $2.8 billion. As such, the combined firm will be far and away the biggest player in this space once the deal closes, with a likely market cap in the $35-$40 billion range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even prior to announcing this deal, American Water Works was already guiding that it would spend roughly $18 billion on CAPEX between 2025 and 2029. That's a large number, all things considered, and now that figure should further increase as the company takes on the maintenance, repairs, and expansion of Essential Utilities' water infrastructure as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the company's combined size will make it far and away the most well-known and liquid investment vehicle for the U.S. water utility sector. The practical consequence is that the combined firm should have a lower cost of capital than its peers and be able to sell bonds at attractive interest rates thanks to its scale and platform advantage. It will also be a leading bidder when privately held water systems come up for public sale. With its low cost of capital and national-scale footprint, it is a logical acquirer to keep rolling up smaller water systems around the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, I would note that American Water Works has grown earnings per share more quickly than Essential Utilities over the past decade. Essential Utilities got a boost from its 2020 acquisition of <strong>Peoples Natural Gas</strong>, but aside from that, American Water Works has generally had a more favorable growth profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is to say that while investors are making a sacrifice in terms of the starting dividend yield today in swapping WTRG shares for American Water Works, this could be offset with a higher earnings per share growth rate. And, ultimately, stronger EPS growth should lead to solid annual dividend increases as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">WTRG Stock Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand why some investors are not pleased with this deal. As a longtime Essential Utilities shareholder myself, I'm not particularly thrilled with the takeover price or premium being offered here. I think WTRG stock should be worth more than $40 per share in a takeover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we are getting paid via American Water Works shares, and AWK stock has been basically flat since 2019, which is a major deviation from its usual longer-term trend:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, American Water Works revenues and earnings per share have continued to grow at a healthy clip. This continues now, with American Water Works' recent Q3 earnings report showing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510758-american-water-works-gaap-eps-of-1_94-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-1_45b-beats-by-120m\">9.8% year-over-year revenue growth</a> and a healthy EPS beat. The Essential Utilities acquisition should also aid that growth rate going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this to say that AWK stock is also trading at a fairly low valuation now compared to its past history. The water utility industry as a whole is dealing with depressed valuations. While I was expecting significant upside in WTRG stock going forward, I see substantial room for AWK stock to trade higher as well once sentiment improves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, as interest rates drop, we may see investors flood back into dividend stocks and defensive risk-off type assets, especially if a recession occurs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting these factors together, it's fair to say that I don't love this deal. But I can see the strategic rationale. I certainly get the appeal of having a larger scale business with a lower cost of funding operations, especially as American Water Works is in a significant investment cycle right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At one point, AWK stock had traded up to more than 40x trailing earnings and close to 25x EV/EBITDA. That valuation was hard to justify. But shares have cooled off dramatically since then, and this looks like a reasonably attractive entry point:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I plan to hold my WTRG shares up through the deal and let them convert into shares of American Water Works.

Capstone has recently <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/news/capstone-copper-announces-up-to-360-million-investment-from-orion-for-25-interest-in-santo-domingo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> the partnership with Orion Resource Partners, which has acquired 25% of that project for up to $360M. While Orion is certainly a competent partner for this project, and Capstone needed a partner here not to overextend its balance sheet, the sales price was on the low side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">$360M is about 21% of the net present value of Santo Domingo using the latest feasibility study of this project, where conservative metal prices were used. The copper price was $4.10/lb and the gold price was $1,800/oz in that feasibility study. There is a buyback option in this deal following commercial production, which likely explains the lower sales price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have covered Capstone quarterly over the last couple of years, and my prior articles can be found <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=CS%3ACA\">here</a>. Today's article will focus on the Q3 2025 result that was released yesterday after the close, and the company also hosted a conference call yesterday, which can be found <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/investors/events-and-presentations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price performance of Capstone sold off substantially in April of this year, which happened to many copper miners, but the drawdown for Capstone was more pronounced. This caused me to add the stock to my portfolio in the C$6-8 range earlier this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capstone has recovered substantially from the lows and is up 37% in U.S. dollar terms this year. Much of the recovery is likely due to the strong copper price, where the COMEX copper price is back above $5/lb and the LME Copper price is not far behind, just below $5/lb. The <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/news/capstone-copper-announces-sanctioning-of-mantoverde-optimized-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sanctioning</a> of the Mantoverde Optimized project in August of this year has likely been a tailwind as well. The most recent stock price dip has coincided with the 25% sale of Santo Domingo to Orion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1359\" data-height=\"829\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 2 - Source: TradingView\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17618976300561206_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 2 - Source: TradingView</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 Result</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capstone reported another record sales and record adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025.

The production is set to grow both in the near term and longer term, while the operating costs will decrease gradually. That is a very attractive combination, especially in the current environment where copper prices are around $5/lb.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"903\" data-height=\"482\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 7 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 7 - Source: Koyfin</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price performance for Capstone has been strong from the lows earlier this year, and it has been relatively good in 2025 overall. However, with a higher copper price and higher production expected from Mantoverde Optimized in the next couple of years, the valuation does not feel excessive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The EV to 2026 &amp; 2027 EBITDA is around 5-6, and I do think those EBITDA estimates will be somewhat conservative if the current copper price holds going forward. So, while the risk-reward has worsened some following the recent rally, I still rate Capstone Copper as a buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There aren't that many copper mining companies with good operating histories and jurisdictions trading at this price. Given that Capstone has plenty of reserves and likely further growth potential from the existing assets, there is still a lot to look forward to for Capstone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic weakness or a strong dollar that might impact the copper price are probably the main risks to be aware of, even if the good balance sheet and lower cost operation make Capstone relatively resilient over time. Stable production at the 4 operating mines will be important over the next few years as well, when the company is set to fund the construction of Santo Domingo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1246\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Source: Capstone Copper Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 8 - Source: Capstone Copper Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
