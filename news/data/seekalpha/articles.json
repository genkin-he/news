That’s up rather notably from $435 million at the time of my previous analysis. Its </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/expenses\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/expenses\" target=\"_blank\"><span>annual expense ratio</span></a><span> is low to moderate at 35 basis points, while the trailing </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/dividends/scorecard\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/dividends/scorecard\" target=\"_blank\"><span>12-month dividend yield</span></a><span> is not too far above that of the S&amp;P 500 at 1.50% as of Oct. 29, 2025.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/momentum/performance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/momentum/performance\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Share-price momentum</span></a><span> has eased from earlier in the year, currently earning a B ETF Grade in that category by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. KCE is a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/risk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/risk\" target=\"_blank\"><span>risky product</span></a><span>, however, given its concentration in a single, often cyclical industry. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Finally, on </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/liquidity\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KCE/liquidity\" target=\"_blank\"><span>liquidity</span></a><span>, there has been some improvement since my Q2 assessment—average daily volume is now 34,000 shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is slightly tighter at 16 basis points, per SSGA Funds.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For an update on the portfolio, the 4-star, Neutral-rated ETF by Morningstar has mixed exposure across the style box, though the majority of the allocation is found in the small-cap space, which adds to its cyclical and macro risk.

Notice in the chart below that shares are approaching critical support levels. First, the long-term 200-day moving average is on the rise, suggesting that the bulls control the primary trend. Additionally, the 200dma is just a few percentage points below the current level. Second, there’s a downside gap in the high $130s that would mark a key technical buying spot.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph. It has been trending lower since July. Note that the RSI peaked well before the price made a high (as is commonly the case). Today, the RSI has made a higher low compared to the mid-October trough. Still, the bulls have their work cut out for them, given a significant amount of volume by price up to the $158 resistance spot.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">KCE: Key Support In Play, Possible RSI Improvement, Rising 200dma</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"553\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"KCE: Key Support In Play, Possible RSI Improvement, Rising 200dma\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The Bottom Line</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I have a <span>\"B</span>uy\" rating on KCE.

That sets the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> foundation for what’s turning out to be one of the strongest quarterly reporting periods in years. What’s more, S&amp;P 500 consensus EPS estimates for the next 12 months are closing in on $300 for the first time.</span><sup class=\"paywall-full-content\">1</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The SPX’s ascent to 6800+ yields a P/E ratio just below 23x. In short, both price and profits are in rally mode, which the bulls are happy to see. Meanwhile, volatility across the stock and bond markets has cooled after a mid-October scare that saw the Cboe Volatility Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIX\" title=\"S&amp;P VIX Index\">VIX</a>) spike near 29. It’s back in the mid-teens now, just as the ICE BofA MOVE Index of Treasury volatility sputters close to 47-month lows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bond market gets its time in the spotlight today, Fed Day, of course. Yields have eased since May, thanks in part to gradually softening economic uncertainty. The macro backdrop is not pristine, but stocks seem to be pricing in a Goldilocks scenario. Big tech, big banks, and the man with the biggest net worth are in focus this week, not from an earnings perspective but from several potentially revealing shareholder events.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">November 4-5: Lam Research and KLA, Two Semiconductor Bellwethers, Take the Stage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chips are in focus on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. The days may be getting darker (for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere), but times have seemingly never been brighter within semiconductors. Both Lam Research (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX\" title=\"Lam Research Corporation\">LRCX</a>) and KLA Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAC\" title=\"KLA Corporation\">KLAC</a>) are in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMH\" title=\"VanEck Semiconductor ETF\">SMH</a>). The fund has more than doubled off its April low, and all eyes will soon be on NVIDIA’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) fiscal Q3 2026 earnings report due out on Wednesday, November 19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before that, Lam (virtually) hosts its Annual Meeting of Stockholders next Tuesday. There, shareholders could hear about new capital allocation decisions, which is particularly interesting right now given the heavy investment in AI and semiconductor manufacturing. Lam reported its fiscal Q1 numbers a week ago, beating on both the top and bottom lines. Projecting resilient revenue for the year ahead (despite sagging demand out of China), it’s reasonable to expect an upbeat shareholder event.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for KLA, it reports tonight (October 29), after a slew of sell-side upgrades across the semiconductor equipment industry. Shares are higher by almost 100% on the year, and any additional clues on its order backlog or developments in China could move the stock. All the commentary sets the table for NVIDIA’s show later in the month.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">November 5: Bank of America’s First Investor Day Since 2011</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the most consequential corporate event hits next Wednesday, when Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) hosts its first Investor Day in 14 years.<sup>2</sup> The long hiatus makes this gathering particularly noteworthy. The banking industry has undergone massive changes since 2011, from the implementation of Dodd-Frank amid the zero interest rate policy era to the digital banking revolution. Today, with crypto making institutional inroads and Treasury yields dropping from multi-decade highs, there are mixed signals for the big money center banks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Brian Moynihan will presumably grab the mic and offer details on BofA’s plans to navigate the new era. He usually keeps an upbeat tone, unlike his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>). Recall that Jamie Dimon talked of cockroaches lurking behind banking walls earlier in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BofA shareholders may seek fresh clues on the health of the consumer, along with how the housing market may evolve with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dipping ever closer to a 5-handle. Furthermore, any added color on deposit trends, delinquency rates, or spending behavior will feed directly into how markets assess the health of the economy heading into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Financials sector as a whole has been sagging on an absolute and relative basis. The group was leading for much of 2024 and into the first half of this year. An optimistic tone would nicely buttress BofA’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831715-q3-earnings-season-kicks-off-major-banks-thrive-while-regional-lenders-signal-trouble\" rel=\"noopener\">big earnings beat</a> two weeks ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">November 6: Tesla Shareholders Have Their Say</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If BofA’s Investor Day is the C-SPAN of key corporate events in early November, Tesla’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>) shareholder meeting is like <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>. The list of key agenda items will be long, but surely the most anticipated is the vote on Elon Musk’s enormous proposed pay package.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s board asks equityholders to approve a performance-based compensation award for the world’s richest person. It also stresses that if the package is not approved, the EV automaker - with its valuation pinned to robotics and AI - risks losing Musk’s “time, energy, and considerable talents.”<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s estimated that if the ambitious milestones are met, the package could net Musk a staggering $1 trillion in equity. That would require a TSLA market cap of a seemingly out-of-reach $8.5 trillion, along with other operational and strategic targets.<sup>4</sup> If it’s not given a thumbs-up, Musk could retaliate or make other threats as the firm’s clear leader.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The shareholder meeting transcends Tesla and Musk, though. It could be viewed as a litmus test on corporate governance. It remains to be seen how aligned the board is with Musk, how independent it is, and how shareholder-friendly the incentives are.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 earnings data and corporate commentary will be huge in the next few weeks, but investors should also keep close tabs on developments from virtual and in-person shareholder meetings and Investor/Analyst Days. Facts and figures regarding AI, the global banking environment, and perhaps even the future of corporate governance are financial wildcards in the week ahead.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><sup>1</sup><a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_102425.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> FactSet Earnings Insight</a>, John Butters, October 24, 2025<br><sup>2</sup> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82e1d2db-cccc-4080-876a-fab28b1a2676\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan shakes up leadership team</a>, Financial Times, Akila Quinio, September 12, 2025<br><sup>3</sup> <a href=\"https://www.votetesla.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Future of Tesla Is in Your Hands</a>, Tesla, October 28, 2025<br><sup>4</sup> <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/07/business/elon-musk-tesla-trillion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Tesla just threw $1 trillion at Elon Musk</a>, CNN, Chris Isidore, September 7, 2025</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Musks-Pay-Vote-and-BofAs-Rare-Investor-Day-Headline-Busy-Shareholder-Event-Stretch\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

The ETF, owned by Vanguard, invests in US government bonds denominated in dollars, with intermediate maturities of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> between 3 and 7 years usually, with an expense ratio of 0.03%. This means that in this vehicle everything revolves around the movement of the yields of the treasury and the coupons that pay those bonds. In this case there are no corporate credit or mortgage instruments, which makes it easier for the reader to understand the investment universe described. Although the fund performs well overall, I believe that the conditions necessary for an optimal purchase are not in place, as the reader will appreciate in this article.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The operation of the fund is quite simple in this case. The fund collects the coupons on the bonds it holds and passes them on in the form of regular distributions to its investors. At the same time, the NAV rises or falls depending on what the Treasury IRRs do. In case they fall, the bonds are worth more and the ETF price rises; if the IRRs rise instead, the price falls. To all this must be added the roll-down effect of each bond, which is that as the bonds of the fund are maturing and managers renew them, if they do not change because the rate curve does not change, they are usually renewed at a somewhat lower IRR. This small decrease in IRR usually generates a discrete profitability bonus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sensitivity of the fund to rate movements is at a balanced point, as it has an average duration, depending on the type of bonds in which it invests. This allows the management team to manage duration risk in a more controlled way, in a more manageable way than if it were a long-term treasury fund. In a context of disinflation or less restrictive monetary policy as the current one, the 3-7 year tranche reacts well, as the price of the fund is able to pick up the understanding of returns and consequently will benefit a potential portfolio, including this type of vehicle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make this happen in an orderly fashion, Vanguard replicates an intermediate-duration Treasuries benchmark. The objective is to equalize the behavior of the index, discounting commissions, with a low tracking error. In this case, the monitoring operation combines two approaches. When liquidity allows, virtually everything in the index is bought at very close weights, resulting in complete replication. In case it is not worth having each CUSIP, the optimized sampling technique is used: which consists of buying a basket of bonds with the same characteristics as the basket of the index.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"841\" data-height=\"322\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund KPIs\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the screenshot above, readers can see the different ETF data relevant to making the right decisions. Of particular note is the turnover figure of 52%. Although it is categorised as a D, this is not a bad figure. In an index ETF such as this one, bonds age and fall below three years, at which point they are removed from the index. At that time, the fund must sell them and buy longer issues to maintain the target duration. This simple ‘turnover’ generates structural rotation and justifies the turnover ratio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis - Macro Fundamental</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this section, we will analyze some macroeconomic indicators in detail to try to offer the reader an accurate perspective and a sound recommendation on the vehicle in question.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1026\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VGIT - Curve &amp; Financial Conditions\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first proposed metric shows three variables that are important for the analysis of a vehicle of this type. These variables are the shape of the rate curve (<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10\" target=\"_blank\">spread of the 10-year</a> vs. <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3\" target=\"_blank\">the 3M tranche</a>), the state of financial conditions as measured by the Chicago Federal Reserve (<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFCI\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFCI\" target=\"_blank\">NFCI</a>), and the liquidity boost, as measured by the 13-week change in the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve’s balance sheet</a>. As we can see in the graph, when the curve is reversed more, the market usually discounts situations of economic slowdown or rate cuts in the near future, which pushes down the IRRs of the 3-7 year stretch, which is where the analyzed vehicle moves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we add to this that the financial conditions are tense (NFCI), the classic “flight to quality” can appear, a situation in which the demand for treasuries increases. The third element we have, and include, is the Fed’s balance sheet. This variable gives us context in the aspect of the activity carried out by central banks. In QE situations, when central banks extract duration from the market through their asset purchase programs (bonds), they provide liquidity that often favors the maturity bracket of this type.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The signal is now at a neutral level, because the curve has undone some of the investment that it made a few quarters ago, the financial indicator (NFCI) does not indicate a severe tightening of conditions, and the Federal Reserve’s 13-week momentum is not being expansionary, at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this situation in hand, we can say that, according to this first panel, the profitability of the ETF analyzed depends now more on carry and roll-down, than on a theoretical “macro rally” (decrease in real rates, more inverted curve, or increases in net financial liquidity).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1027\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VGIT - Nominal to Real Discount\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the second metric, we look at the main driver of performance for an ETF such as the one analyzed. We care mainly about the real cost of money and the inflation that discounts the market. As we can see in the graph, we have the green line, which expresses the inverted z-score of the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII5\" target=\"_blank\">real 5-year type</a>. When this line goes down, future flows are discounted at a lower cost, favoring the nominal bonds of the 3-7 year tranche, which is where the analyzed ETF operates, as they increase its price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second key element to comment on here is the 5-year breakeven line (<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE\" target=\"_blank\">T5YIE</a>), which is the variable that approximates the inflation expected by the market over that time horizon (5 years). In case this breakeven cools down, the inflation premium demanded by the investor drops, and, again, nominal IRRs tend to fall; for consistency, we also treat it as inverted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current reality is that the variables in the graph are in a neutral zone. This means that real rates are not at the local highs of a few months ago (this reduces downward pressure on the fund price), the breakeven variable does not show inflationary stress overflowing, and the “claims” element does not reflect a sharp deterioration in employment today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Features and Performance Analysis</strong></h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"429\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Comparative\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"738\" data-height=\"252\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Data\" width=\"640\" height=\"219\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the screenshot above, we show a comparison of the performance of the VGIT ETF, as well as its main characteristics (costs, AUM, and management), compared to two other ETFs in the same category, belonging to BlackRock (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEF\" title=\"iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF\">IEF</a>) and Vanguard (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIV\" title=\"Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index Fund ETF Shares\">BIV</a>). As readers can see, the ETF analyzed outperforms its main competitor (IEF - BlackRock) in the long term. When analyzing why this is the case, we find the answer by focusing on the fees charged by each fund. The two funds managed by Vanguard charge an annual management fee of 0.03%, while BlackRock's ETF charges 0.15%. This difference is significant for us when choosing one vehicle over another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the BIV ETF, it currently outperforms both VGIT and IEF. This is because it has the longest effective duration of the three ETFs compared. BIV currently has an effective duration of 7.2 years, compared to 5.6 (VGIT) and 6.9 (IEF). This means that within the intermediate tranche, BIV invests in maturities that are slightly higher than the other two ETFs, which gives it that extra return (it is also conditioned by greater exposure to corporate credit).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this in mind, it makes sense to me to keep the vehicle in the portfolio. Readers may choose to let the monthly coupon continue to work, allowing the roll-down to accumulate and monitoring the thresholds of the variables discussed here. I recommend buying, but only if and when we see a potential catalyst for an increase in carry. Until then, stay out if you are not already in. Thank you for reading.</p>",

The policy-sensitive 2-year rate, for example, shot up on Wednesday to 3.60%, a three-week high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fed's Powell Raises Doubts About Another Rate Cut\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"792\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_two.yr_.30oct2025.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Fed funds futures</a> are still pricing in moderately high odds that favor another rate cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, but the implied probability is 72%, which leaves room for debate about how the end of the year unfolds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of the reasoning for possibly pausing on rate cuts is the delay in new economic reports due to the government shutdown. “What do you do if you’re driving the fog? You slow down,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/30/fed-cut-rates-officials-disagree-on-whats-next/86964505007/\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>, referring to the postponed numbers, such as the monthly payrolls report for September which remains in hiatus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The lack of new economic numbers is “very concerning,” former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/29/powell-cuts-interest-rates-employment-inflation-trump-incompetent/\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>Fortune, </em>noting that the Fed is “flying blind.” She explained: “If policymakers build systems around data that can vanish overnight, that’s a real vulnerability for economic governance.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The special release of consumer inflation data for September showed headline CPI rising 3.0% year-over-year, the highest since January. But Powell expressed a degree of optimism that to the extent that pricing pressure is rising due to tariffs, it will be a one-time effect that won’t push up inflation much longer beyond what’s already been seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“Inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2% goal,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0p7g7560o\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>. He advised that central bankers are looking for signs that tariffs only lead to one-time price increases for certain consumer products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the uncertainty linked to delayed data, weakness in hiring will likely keep the Fed on a rate-cutting path, predicts Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. “The downside risks within the job market will likely ensure the Fed will continue to cut rates in December and throughout the next year,” he reasoned in a press release sent to CapitalSpectator.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fed's Powell Raises Doubts About Another Rate Cut\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"432\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The critical variable in the days and weeks ahead is how the Treasury market reacts.

This is due to softer seaborne coal prices, increasing electricity prices in the U.S., and a potential policy shift with regards to coal from the new U.S. administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peabody is a company I have covered frequently over the last couple of years and my prior articles can be found <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=BTU\">here</a>. This article will focus on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285879-peabody-reports-results-for-quarter-ended-september-30-2025#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 2025 results</a> that was released this morning and the company is at 10 am CT today hosting a conference call, which can be joined <a href=\"https://app.webinar.net/vmXLJVLydan\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=BTU\">most recent articles</a> on Peabody have had Strong Buy ratings following an extreme selloff in conjunction with the Anglo American (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAUKF\" title=\"Anglo American plc\">OTCQX:AAUKF</a>) coal deal, that led to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTU/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> concerns by the market for Peabody. The stock price of Peabody has rallied a lot from the lows earlier this year, partly because this deal was cancelled due to a <a href=\"https://www.peabodyenergy.com/Home/Company-News-1181\" rel=\"nofollow\">material adverse change</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the strong rally from its lows, I have lowered my rating from a Strong Buy to a Buy, as the risk reward isn't as attractive at this level compared to the sub $20 that we saw during much of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, I still think Peabody is an attractive investment and it is far from expensive, with what I think mid-cycle earnings will be for the company. The U.S. thermal coal now looks to be adding very welcomed optionality, where that optionality and a depressed valuation going into the year, explains the outperformance in 2025. Peabody is up 31% year-to-date, which is impressive when we consider that the drawdown this year was as much as 50% in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 2 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 2 - Source: Koyfin</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 Result</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1216\" data-height=\"511\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 3 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"269\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 3 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peabody reported an adjusted EBITDA of $100M in the most recent quarter and earnings per diluted share were $-0.58. Adjusted EBITDA was slightly better than expected and up 7% compared to Q2. Earnings per share were below expectation, but net income was impacted by $54M in costs related to the terminated acquisition. Overall, this was a relatively positive result even if it was still a weak quarter on a historical comparison.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Seaborne Metallurgical segment did see a rebound from the previous quarter when the EBITDA was negative in the segment. The sales price of $121/t was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, while costs of $108/t declined as much as 9% in Q3 compared to Q2. The EBITDA in the segment was a reasonably healthy $28M in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Centurion mine will start longwall mining in Q1 2026, which is expected to have lower cost, and the sales price will demand a premium for its low vol coking coal. So, this segment is likely to start generating a more substantial EBITDA in the not-too-distant future, even if the seaborne coking coal market remains somewhat subdued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"898\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 4 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"289\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 4 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Seaborne Thermal segment saw a rebound in coal sales to 4.1 million tons in Q3, the sales price in the quarter was $59.3/t, an 11% increase compared to Q2, and the EBITDA margin was $13/t in Q3.

However, that is due to the very soft coal prices at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would argue the mid-cycle EBITDA is probably closer to $1.5B for Peabody and the enterprise value is $3.0B, which takes the EV to EBITDA to 2.0. Let's say I am overly aggressive here, and the mid-cycle EBITDA is only $1B, which Peabody was able to double during the peak in 2022, and that was without Centurion I might add. Then the EV to EBITDA would be around 3.0, which isn't particularly expensive either. The attractive valuation is primarily why I continue to rate Peabody as a Buy, and it is a core holding in my portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There will always be risks to consider as well, where the commodity price risk is the main risk to be aware of as coal prices are cyclical. While I do think coal prices need to recover from the current level, coal prices can likely stay depressed longer than most expect. The good balance sheet, liquidity, and diversified production will offset the impact some for Peabody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential risk is litigation risk following the termination of the Anglo American coal deal, where Anglo American does not agree with the material adverse change following the ignition event at one of the mines. While I do think Peabody is likely to beat this in court, there is the possibility that the courts would side with Anglo American and force Peabody to pay a substantial break-up fee.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I continue to think that the risk reward is relatively attractive for Peabody here, even if we might see some more consolidation in the near term following the strong rally over the last 6 months. Centurion will provide a very welcomed boost to earnings next year. </p>",

My view has changed. While<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the valuation multiple is still high, I now believe multiples could continue staying at this level given the growth momentum, upgraded guidance, and tangible catalysts.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWI reported a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20281401-armstrong-world-industries-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">strong Q3</a> that really changed my mind on the business and outlook. Total net sales grew 10% y/y to $425.2 million, setting a new third-quarter high. The Mineral Fiber [MF] segment saw 6.2% y/y growth, driving sales to $274 million. While most of the growth came from favorable pricing and mix ($14 million contribution), volume contributed too, which was positive as this marks the second consecutive quarter of positive volume growth. And this does signal that the demand backdrop is recovering. As for the Architectural Specialties [AS] segment, it remained as the core growth driver, with net sales up 17.6% y/y to $151.2 million. To be fair, ~$16 million came from the 3form and Zahner acquisitions, but even if we adjust for these, organic sales still grew $7 million, or 6% y/y, and this is despite tougher comps. Margins were the only negative takeaway here. Consolidated adj. EBITDA margin contracted 120 bps to 34.7%, with both MF and AS seeing margin contraction. Anyway, I don’t think much attention should be paid to this margin pressure since the real takeaway is the 13.3% y/y EPS growth to $2.05.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Accelerates, Justifying the Premium</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered AWI, my hold rating was driven almost entirely by valuation. The stock looked expensive, and I wasn’t convinced there was enough room for upside surprise. After seeing the 3Q25 results and, more importantly, the upgraded outlook, I believe I have been too conservative previously. It seems clearer to me that the AWI growth story is actually getting much better, which justifies its premium multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key update here, I think, is management’s decision to raise FY2025 adj. EPS guidance. The new guide calls for a range of $7.45–$7.55, which implies 18%–20% y/y growth. Management also effectively dismissed the bear case (poor volume demand) for the MF segment by calling the market stabilizing and raising the FY2025 volume outlook. Remember that Q3 ended on 30th September, and the results came out just yesterday, which means management already had one full month of data (for Q4). This makes the volume guide credible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from the guide, AWI’s digital strategy continues to show its worth. I said before that this is a competitive edge, and AWI proved me right this quarter. The new highlight this quarter is Kanopi, an e-commerce platform that saw record sales and EBITDA. This is noteworthy because it confirms AWI’s ability to reach smaller and previously underserved customers profitably. The keyword is profitably, because anyone can chase after volume by heavily subsidizing it, but doing it profitably means that AWI has built a platform that can efficiently handle these smaller customers’ orders (low-volume orders, so it is hard to make the unit economics work vs. a large-volume order, as fixed cost is spread over a smaller base). From a growth perspective, this means AWI's growth runway has extended longer, as it can now go after the long tail of demand (e.g., demand from smaller contractors that typically require more niche products). Or you can just think of this as AWI expanding its total addressable market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the ProjectWorks design platform continues to gain traction as I expected. For recap, my general view was that ProjectWorks simplifies complex designs and installations, and that makes the life of architects easier, which drives adoption. However, it seems like I am missing a part of the story. Management noted another benefit that I thought was very bullish. This ProjectWorks design platform doesn’t just make the life of architects easier; it also addresses the problem of <a href=\"https://www.agc.org/news/2025/08/28/construction-workforce-shortages-are-leading-cause-project-delays-immigration-enforcement-affects\" rel=\"nofollow\">labor shortages in construction</a>. By automating design rules and stepping up the pace of iterations, ProjectWorks actually increases productivity for contractors as well. Rather than directly reducing the number of labor contractors needed, it drives efficiency by reducing “wasted attempts.” Better design rules and iterations result in precise bills of materials that reduce the frequency of rework.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential growth catalyst is the office segment, which represents ~30% of AWI’s total demand. Most readers would know that the office segment has been a drag on the business ever since Covid (more work-from-home policy that reduces the need for office spaces). However, we may have reached an inflection point. For the first time in seven years, US office vacancy rates have moved lower (per a third-party data cited by management during the call). This is too early to call it a recovery trend, but it does support the narrative of the ongoing <a href=\"https://archieapp.co/blog/return-to-office-statistics/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">return-to-office trend</a>. AWI is already seeing early benefits, with increasing tenant improvement projects in its order flow. Tenants wouldn’t spend capex to improve if they are not seeing improving end demand. In my view, this could be a meaningful swing factor. Even if the office market simply stabilizes, it removes an overhang on the stock, and in the bull case, if it becomes a tailwind, it could unlock incremental volume and operating leverage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet and capital allocation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1664\" data-height=\"855\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screen shot of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the balance sheet, I don’t see much of a problem for AWI to continue reinvesting for growth. The business is generating a good amount of cash (adj. free cash flow is up 22% year-to-date), allowing it to fund growth without tapping hard into leverage. In fact, the business is generating so much cash that in Q3 alone, management raised its dividend by 10%, repurchased $27 million of stock, and even did a bolt-on acquisition (bought <a href=\"https://www.armstrongceilings.com/commercial/en/press-releases/armstrong-acquires-geometrik.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geometrik</a> for $7.5 million). I am not incorporating this into my base case, but there is a potential for AWI to re-lever up its balance sheet back to the historical leverage ratio (&gt;1x EBITDA) and return that cash to shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"792\" data-height=\"462\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Value Sights</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view on the stock has changed for the better. I think there is a good chance that AWI will continue to grow as low-teens (FY25 13% was guided), and if we keep margins flat, earnings could grow to $470 million in FY28, and that solid growth (relatively better than peers, as shown below) should continue to justify multiples to stay at the current premium elevated level (23x forward PE vs. peers with an average of 12x). While I noted that the last time this happened, the multiples re-rated downwards quickly, I think this time may be different. There are visible growth catalysts that could continue to support growth. Also note that the recovery in the office segment could elevate growth higher.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"383\" height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LTM sales growth <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are execution risks that could hurt growth. Specifically, the AS segment growth still depends on successfully integrating 3form and Zahner, which are currently weighing on segment margins. If the synergies are lower than expected, earnings growth could be weaker than I expected. On costs, about $6 million in Q3 operating expenses were one-off expenses that management called out as timing-related, and we should see a sequential improvement in cost. The risk here is that ongoing inflation, especially in energy prices, could mask this “improvement,” and the market may inch closer to being conservative when modelling margins (I am modelling flat; they may model declining margins).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am upgrading my rating on AWI to buy. My previous view that valuation was too high is no longer the case given the growth momentum and raised guidance. The digital strategy also continues to work, with Kanopi and ProjectWorks showing tangible results. There is also the office space segment that is finally showing signs of inflecting into a tailwind. All in all, I can bridge to a nice upside case if AWI can continue to grow at low teens with a 20% net margin.</p>",

And more stock buybacks are likely to get executed in Q4... which should especially benefit the Search business given the inclusion of the holiday period. Going forward, I expect Google to invest more money into:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The development of new AI-driven products, such as AI queries, which are integrated into Search and Cloud and which accelerate Google's growth in the core business</li> <li>Data Centers in order to accommodate soaring demand for AI-driven workloads. In this regard, Google just <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">raised its FY 2025 CapEx outloo</a>k from $85.0B to a new range of $91-93B and the company has guided for a significant CapEx boost next year.</li> <li>Stock buybacks. The tech company may boost its stock authorization next year and potentially increase its buyback size (from a current $70B authorization) if free cash flow performance remain strong</li> <li>The acquisition of AI start-ups. In order to accelerate its AI-centric growth strategy in Search and Cloud, Google may turn to a more acquisition-focused approach to boosting its top line growth.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google’s valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past, I recommended Alphabet chiefly because the company was the cheapest big tech stock, despite delivering double-digit top line growth and being highly profitable. Shares of Alphabet are currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7X, but are still relatively cheap compared to other big tech companies in the industry group... many of whom trade a significantly higher earnings multipliers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As revaluation catalysts for Google I see 1) Accelerating AI spending in the enterprise market which could drive results in Cloud especially, 2) Expanding operating income profitability, driven by AI product up-take in Cloud, and 3) Strength in digital advertising spending backing up the firm’s largest segment (Search), especially in the fourth-quarter... which is typically a strong one for companies selling digital ads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, shares of Alphabet could revalue to a ~30X P/E ratio fairly easily... under the condition that Alphabet continues to grow at double-digit rates and CapEx spending in the enterprise market doesn’t slow. Google is currently expected to generate $10.73 per-share in earnings in FY 2026, implying 8% Y/Y growth, which calculates to a fair value of $322 per-share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with Google</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk for Alphabet, as I see it, relates to a potential slowdown in AI-driven CapEx spending in the enterprise market which could hurt the company’s growth momentum in the Cloud business. What would therefore potentially negatively impact my bullish view on the technology firm is if the firm's stellar Cloud-driven growth moderated or if Google saw a deterioration of its free cash flow margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The firm's strong FCF is key to Google's AI-driven CapEx ramp as well as stock buybacks, so any deterioration in the fundamentals of the core digital advertising market is likely going to have a severe valuation impact on Google's stock outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google has received a steady stream of positive results in the last several months including a favorable court ruling regarding its Chrome browser which pushed shares into a new up-leg.... and now the company has submitted an earnings scorecard that crushed Wall Street's estimates. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google is well-positioned as one of the largest public Cloud platforms to cash in on AI-driven Cloud growth and the company is seeing impressive operating income growth. Google's strong Q3 earnings report highlighted robust growth momentum in both Search and Cloud and strength in free cash flows... which is likely going to add to investors' already positive sentiment about the company. After the earnings report, shares of Google soared 7% in the after-hours market, but I see more room for shares to appreciate.</p>",

Adjusted gross profit was down a more modest 4%, while income from operations actually grew by 23% thanks to significant cost discipline. Global shipping rates continue to fall, driving the revenue decline, and Europe has also been a source of weakness. In contrast, CHRW continues to meaningfully gain market share in the U<span>nited States</span>, boosting revenue. As noted on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835094-c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-chrw-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835094-c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-chrw-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a>, freight activity has weakened for 12 straight quarters, with Q3 the worst Q3 since 2009. CHRW’s solid results in this macro backdrop speak to its continued market share gains, as well as its extremely impressive cost management.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRW gains share and margins in U.S. trucking</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) is its largest segment, accounting for about 63% of firmwide gross profit. Volumes grew by 3%, and operating margins expanded for an eighth straight quarter to 39%, approaching its 40% mid-cycle target. Both Truckload and LTL (“less than truckload”) were up about 3%. CHRW estimates that the market declined by 7% in the quarter, so we are seeing the company’s investments in technology meaningfully expand its market share. Adjusted gross profit rose by 6% to $444 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRW generated 8% more gross profit per LTL order while it held gross profit flat per truckload order, a resilient performance despite pricing pressure. The ability to gain market share while also enhancing margins continues to be impressive. As you can see below, gross margins have been steadily increasing and are essentially at the highest level since before COVID. However, the dollar value of gross profit per shipment remains depressed, just given the weakness in the U.S. trucking market. If we eventually see an upturn in the trucking market, there should be meaningful gross profit upside. Unfortunately, given sluggish economic activity, I do not see this occurring within the next 12 months.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1089\" data-height=\"385\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H.

Still, the weak global shipping environment is weighing as tariffs reduce trade volume. As a result, gross profit fell by 18% from last year, as ocean volumes fell by 7% and air declined by 10%. As you can see below, the majority of this business is tied to ocean freight, and that market is extremely challenged, with gross profit down by nearly a third to $111 million. The ongoing conflict in the Red Sea also has forced vessel rerouting along more expensive and time-consuming routes, a structural challenge that appears unlikely to end soon.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a blue and white table AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"433\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H. Robinson</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, gross profit per ocean shipment fell by 27%. Gross profit per air shipment rose by 17%, helping to offset volume declines, and mix shift led to a 31% jump in gross profit per customs transaction. Still, these segments are too small to offset pressure in Ocean freight, and I expect global trade activity to remain muted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, aside from stronger earnings, sentiment around CHRW is likely being boosted this morning by the conciliatory U.S.-China <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> overnight whereby the United States agreed to tariff rates of 47% from 57%, and China agreed to delay rare earth export controls. Tariff rates are still high, which will continue to greatly restrict U.S.-China trade in my view. All else equal, increased trade between the U.S. &amp; China will benefit CHRW’s business, so the fact that the two countries chose de-escalation over escalation is a positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost performance impresses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its Lean AI initiative continues to deliver cost efficiencies. The company continues to increase its use of “AI agents” to provide quotes, take orders, connect with carriers, and manage payments. By continuing to automate tasks that were previously done manually by employees, we are seeing the company generate meaningful savings. In fact, average employee headcount is down nearly 11% from last year, and operating expenses fell by 13% to $485 million. CHRW’s technology spending is creating clear efficiency savings.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H. Robinson</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, CHRW bought back $115 million of stock. The company maintains an excellent balance sheet with just 1.2x debt/EBITDA leverage and ~$1.2 billion of long-term debt. With leverage coming down, management expects more share repurchases over the next year. Between its dividend and buyback, I expect at least $600 million of capital returns next year, or at least $5.50/share. Aside from buybacks, CHRW pays a 1.9% dividend yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far this year, the company has generated $554 million of free cash flow. Back in April, I was targeting $550-$650 million of free cash flow. With margin performance exceeding my expectations and the tariff outcome not as bad as feared in April, I now see CHRW generating about $670-$720 million of free cash flow this year, depending on working capital movements, or about $6 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation prices in the good news</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside results, management boosted its 2026 outlook by $50 million to $965 million to $1.04 billion, representing about $6 per share in EPS in an environment where there is zero end-market growth. While 0% growth does not usually seem like an optimistic assumption, that would be a marked improvement from this year. While much of the tariff headwind should already be in results, I see limited scope for volume growth. The company sees about $120 million of savings benefits next year, driving much of its operating income growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"793\" data-height=\"381\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart of a diagram AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H.

Frankly, I am cautious about the freight market turning positive next year. While we may have passed peak tariff pressures, economic activity remains muted. Plus, with NAST approaching mid-cycle levels even in a down market, I suspect that the majority of the margin gains have already occurred. After today’s rally, shares appear to be pricing in the good news. That said, with trade sentiment improvement and buybacks likely to accelerate, the environment should remain favorable towards CHRW. As such, I am downgrading shares to a “<span>H</span>old.” I see no rush to <span>\"S</span>ell,\" but shares are pricing in much of the good news already.</p>",

The market is expected to grow annually by 7.07% (CAGR 2025-2030).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this +7% CAGR forecast comes true, I think it could certainly be an upside factor for firms like this one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, when it comes to certain fruits like bananas, FDP fills a demand that simply cannot be produced in certain parts of the world due to unfavorable climate. For instance, SA analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802637-fresh-del-monte-produce-stock-well-positioned-to-stay-fresh\">Waterside Insight</a> pointed out in their July article on this firm:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Almost 80% of its sales go to North America and Europe, where these fruits are not suitable to grow locally, except for the southern part of the US and Mexico.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the laws of supply and demand impact this industry, as an oversupply of any fruit or vegetable could be a future downside for a company like this, whereas a shortage could work in its favor. Investors should consider that dynamic when considering this sector. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/eat/humid-growing-conditions-lead-to-an-oversupply-of-bananas-priced-at-150kg/news-story/5f62bbf126f6433006fd125d3260cb73\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian news</a> highlighted how past cyclones caused a banana shortage:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Most banana growers took a big hit and there was not much supply around, so the growers who did have supply, they made a lot of money.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDP/growth\">forward revenue growth</a> for this firm is expected to be a mere +1.2%, 55% below its sector average, so that certainly could be a concern to investors putting more weight on the top line results:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58572054-17618156200444124_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"696\" data-height=\"106\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58572054-17618156200444124_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"FDP -

It poses a threat to large commercial producers as well as small-scale local production.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe a mitigating factor that could favor FDP is that it not only is diversified across multiple products (not just bananas) but also uses multiple farms and supply-chain networks globally, so those could mitigate some of this risk, as opposed to a company with a single farm and product whose crop gets wiped out and it cannot sell it to the market.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, my call to action to readers, to conclude today's discussion, is to keep considering Fresh Del Monte if you want some portfolio exposure to this sector for the purpose of diversification, as well as a dividend income opportunity.</p>",
