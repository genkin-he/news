If the interest rates were to return to artificially low levels (i.e., ZIRP), higher equity multiples would be justifiable. However, I work with the assumption that interest rates will eventually track the long-term average of ~5%.

(NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\" class=\"ticker-link\">DOCU</a>) is an American Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company that provides electronic signature and digital transaction management services. It operates under a cloud-based platform named DocuSign Agreement Cloud that enables workflow automation and efficient management of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> electronically signed agreements. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has been a significant benchmark underperformer over the past years. While the stock remained almost flat over the past 12 months with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\">1.6%</a> increase, it is down roughly 68% over the past 5 years. This highlights weak performance, yet I argue the company may be well-positioned to rebound from these levels. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DOCU trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of about 19</a>, implying approximately a 25% discount to the sector median of nearly 26 earnings multiples. In the meantime, the software company operates at substantially above-market margins, which deserve a premium valuation. The company offers AI-tailored solutions to streamline workflows and reduce workloads, which I don't think the market has priced in, and that could fuel a bullish narrative in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I rate DocuSign a Buy with an $81 price target over the next 12 months. I believe the company faces tailwinds that outweigh risks and concerns. This suggests about 14% upside potential and broader market outperformance. I think the stock price may mirror bottom-line growth, which is supported by impressive operating margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FQ2 2026: The 13th Consecutive Double-Beat Quarter. Can The Trend Continue?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On September 4, the company reported <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Financial-Results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FQ2 2026</a> results. This was the 13th consecutive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">double-beat</a> quarter, signaling robust and consistent performance. This sort of stable business activity argues for a premium valuation. The market reacted to the results with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/historical-price-quotes\">a 5% increase</a> in the stock price over the following trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign posted roughly $801 million in revenue, representing 9% growth on a year-over-year basis, and $20 million higher than what the market had anticipated. The bottom line arrived at $0.92 in diluted EPS. Although this was a drop from $0.97 in the same quarter last year, the bottom-line result came in $0.07 above the analysts' estimates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"953\" data-height=\"533\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DOCU: FQ2 2026 Revenue\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617357533678284_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DOCU: FQ2 2026 Revenue <span>(DocuSign Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's digital revenue, which is mainly derived from subscription fees, drove growth and outpaced the overall business. Although their DocuSign is a market leader in the e-signature landscape, which fuels a bullish narrative, its IAM (Intelligent Agreement Management) services may unlock a new growth cycle for the company. It assists clients throughout the entire agreement process, helping automate workflows, manage renewals and obligations, and gain insights from reporting. There are more than <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/408980645/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Q2-26-Docusign-Quarterly-Earnings-Deck.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10,000 organizations</a> that DOCU assists with its IAM solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819777-docusign-inc-docu-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\"> earnings call</a>, management highlighted a 9% customer growth, ending the quarter with more than 1.7 million customers. I also think that this result correlated with the SaaS company's focus on the international expansion, that I believe may remain their core focus in the following quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted that the company experienced 13% international growth, which significantly contributes to the business's bullish outlook. To elaborate, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819777-docusign-inc-docu-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Asia-Pacific Region</a> was the fastest-growing across all markets. I think that this suggests a demographic tailwind for the company, that could significantly contribute to its growth over the following years. This region is densely populated, with a high percentage of population living in the region, with both Japan and Australia highlighted as the direct focus countries. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following this, the company appears more diversified, which makes it a more compelling play and underscores strong demand for its services. In addition, international revenue now accounts for 29% of total revenue. I believe that if management's focus remains on international markets, DOCU could be able to maintain its dominant stance in the operating landscape.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"950\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DOCU: FQ2 2026 International Growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617358934460456_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DOCU: FQ2 2026 International Growth <span>(DocuSign Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, in the <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/408980645/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Q2-26-Docusign-Quarterly-Earnings-Deck.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">presentation</a>, the company noted that it maintained healthy operating efficiency, underscoring 83.8% subscription gross margins and 82% total gross margins. These are exceptional results that deserve a premium valuation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted a comprehensive network of partners, with well-known companies, including Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, Salesforce, and others. Independent software vendors, system integrators, and resellers use DOCU's tools to enhance their workflows. This supports my thesis that DOCU's services are high-quality, appear widely used, and I believe the trend is likely to continue. For instance, on <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Recognized-in-Salesforce-2025-Partner-Innovation-Awards/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">October 13</a>, Salesforce recognized DOCU in the Partner Innovation Awards, highlighting its IAM solution designed for sales, streamlining agreement flow, surfacing agentic actions AI-powered insights. I also think that such recognition supports the bullish trend and future revenue growth, implying a high satisfaction leading to a potentially sticky customer base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The digital signature market size was valued at about <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/digital-signature-market-100356\" rel=\"nofollow\">$10 billion</a> in 2025, and is anticipated to grow tenfold over the following 7 years. This would reflect a 40.1% CAGR and validate my bullish narrative.

DOCU is expected to deliver <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">FQ3 2026 results</a> on November 4 after market close. Wall Street anticipates a continuation of both top and bottom line growth. The market forecasts $807 million in revenue, indicating 7% growth versus the same quarter last year, and $0.91 in diluted EPS, representing about a 2% increase on a year-over-year basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its recent performance, international growth, and strong demand for digital agreement management services, I believe the company may achieve the results. Furthermore, on <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/DOCUSIGN-NAMED-TO-FORTUNES-2025-FUTURE-50-LIST-OF-COMPANIES-WITH-THE-GREATEST-LONG-TERM-GROWTH-PROSPECTS/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">September 15</a>, the company announced it made a Fortune editor list and was included among 50 other companies that are tied to the greatest long-term growth prospects. Such reports are uplifting, but investors should monitor whether management can maintain excellent execution. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the company has substantial tailwinds that could drive further growth. If DOCU can experience a continuation in both top and bottom line growth, I believe the market may reprice the stock at a higher premium multiple. This could drive the stock price and mirror EPS expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign Appears To Be Trading At A Discount, Although It Offers Phenomenal Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The SaaS company currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of 19.22</a>, which appears to be 35% discounted to the sector median of 25.46. This also implies that the company trades at about 24% below the average company in the S&amp;P500 at<a href=\"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a 23.62</a> earnings multiple.

The forward PEG (non-GAAP) of 1.56 supports a bullish outlook for the company and argues that it appears undervalued. This underscores a 15% discount to peers at 1.83. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 4.22 and 4.44, respectively, cloud a positive outlook and imply that the company may be fairly priced. It also presents a possibility that the market has already partially priced in future growth, which may limit the upside in the future. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"878\" data-height=\"221\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DOCU: Capital Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"161\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617383052799845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DOCU: Capital Structure <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, the company seems to be a low-leveraged business, as it only has about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/capital-structure\">$127 million</a> in total obligations. DOCU has approximately $844 million in cash and could pay its debt with ease. This also leaves financial flexibility for management to use debt-related instruments, if needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company grew its revenue by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/growth\">8.29%</a> over the past 12 months, reflecting a roughly 15% higher growth rate than the sector median of 7.22%, and supporting premium valuation. The forward revenue growth rate of 7.34% suggests that the trend is likely to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom-line surged by 13% on a TTM basis from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">$3.14 in FQ3 2024 to FQ3 2025</a> to $3.58 in the past 12 months.

The net income margin (TTM) of 9.08% highlights 2x outperformance compared to the industry's average of 4.49%. This presents a disconnect in valuation. DOCU trades at a discount to peers, although it is tied to outstanding operating margins. I believe the gap may narrow, which supports a bullish stance for the SaaS company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market forecasts a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings/estimates\">$3.68 in diluted EPS</a> for FY2025. This would reflect about 4% growth on a year-over-year basis. Wall Street believes the company may post $4.03 in FY2026, reflecting roughly double-digit bottom-line expansion. Given its strong demand, significant market dominance, tailwinds tied to the digital signature market growth, and outstanding operating margins, I believe the software company could achieve these results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its AI-tailored solutions, I believe the market may reprice DOCU at a higher multiple. If we apply a 20x forward P/E, which could still reflect more than a 20% discount to both peers and the benchmark, at an FY2026 EPS of $4.03, we arrive at my price target of $81. I think that the market overlooks DOCU, as it remains a high-quality, highly profitable company. Time will tell, but it may appear a compelling opportunity for investors seeking SaaS exposure at an appealing valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Main Risks And Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks and concerns tied to DocuSign that could cloud a bullish outlook and impact the stock price performance in the short term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's revenue decelerated from pandemic heights, and I think that is the reason behind a significant sell-off and suppressed valuations. The market overlooks the company and its high-demand business. It may take time for investors to rethink their thesis about the stock, which could cap upside in the near term. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There appears to be fierce competition in the landscape, which raises concerns about the company's future outlook. DocuSign competes with Adobe, Dropbox, Salesforce, and other well-known companies in the field. This may pressure its substantial margins, which could stress the stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe there are risks tied to execution and AI-tailored solutions. So far, DOCU has experienced a limited product diversification, which I think may cap the upside in the near term. If the company fails to broaden its products and services, or AI-tailored solutions do not translate into meaningful top and bottom line growth, investors may not be willing to pay a premium for the software company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, if none of the above were to materialize, I believe the company appears to be well-positioned for continued demand and high SaaS margins. This could drive bottom-line growth, and the stock price may follow the EPS performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: DocuSign Is A Buy, As It Remains A Premium Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that DocuSign remains a high-quality company. The risks and concerns tied to its business appear overblown. DOCU is a low-leveraged company, operating at outstanding margins, which are fueling a bullish narrative and bottom-line growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One could argue that the digital e-signature market may appear mature, which could cloud the upside in the following years, but DOCU continues to innovate, and AI-tailored solutions may unlock a new growth cycle. Nevertheless, the research I shared anticipates a continued market growth, and I believe DOCU could benefit from it.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why I rate DocuSign a Buy with a $81 price target over the next year. It presents a 14% opportunity, highlighting broader market outperformance. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">22 Wall Street</a> analysts forecast a $94 price target, presenting a 36% upside possibility. I favor a more conservative approach, but if tailwinds materialize, this is definitely a possibility.</p>",

My initial <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724107-the-battle-of-two-goliaths-ares-capital-vs-fs-kkr-update\">thesis</a> was based on strong fundamentals, unique loan origination capabilities and diversified investment platform, which positioned ARCC<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> well for capturing the increasing demand for private credit in a high-spread and low-risk manner.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the total return figure was very attractive and exceeded that of BDC index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>), I decided to liquidate my position before <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/851/115851/original.pdf\">Q3 report</a>. In fact, I went even as far as plotting a case for a likely dividend reduction, hence the title of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821765-dare-i-say-it-arcc-is-about-to-cut-its-dividend\">article</a>: <em>Dare I Say It, Ares Capital Is About To Cut Its Dividend</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main reason for this move was the combination of declining base rates, unfavorable exposure to spread compression dynamics, rising risks on the non-accrual front (due to large non first-lien position) and relatively thin base dividend coverage level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, the fact that Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL\" title=\"Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund\">MSDL</a>) and Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBDC\" title=\"Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc.\">KBDC</a>) - comparable high-quality BDCs - were trading at almost 20% cheaper P/NAV metrics made my decision much easier. Just for the context, this is why I consider MSDL and KBDC directly comparable to ARCC:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>All three are externally managed BDCs (i.e., no reason for having premium for more cost effective internal management component).</li> <li>All three have investment grade balance sheets.</li> <li>None of them focuses on venture capital or lower middle market lending.</li> <li>The net debt to equity ratios are rather similar within 1.0x to 1.25x range (usual BDC target capital structure levels); and, actually, KBDC has 0.90x, which provides an advantage in terms of funding growth via additional debt issuances.</li> <li>Non-accruals on a FV basis are below 2.0% for all three names.</li> <li>The portfolio company interest rate coverage ratios are at 2.0x or above (MSDL and KBDC portfolio companies have even higher than it is for ARCC - at 2.0x).</li> <li>The base dividend coverage levels are almost identical - for ARCC it is 102% and for both MSDL and KBDC at 100%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the rationale for exiting ARCC is similar to what I have outlined in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827574-dare-i-say-it-bxsl-is-the-most-overpriced-quality-bdc-rating-downgrade\">piece</a> on Blackstone Secured Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) - i.e., too high price relative to underlying fundamentals and comparable peer valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, my thesis has been playing out nicely actually:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as I have stated in the title of this article, the Q3, 2025 report for ARCC was exceptionally strong, beating the consensus expectations and, to be honest, surprising me as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let's now together dissect the key data points and determine whether ARCC has really become more attractive after the publication of Q3 financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, ARCC bulls could not have asked for better results than what were delivered now. It seems that ARCC was firing on all cylinders in Q3 period, checking the necessary boxes for incremental value creation and stability across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will share the main points that we should appreciate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The NAV per share increased from $19.90 in Q2 to $20.01 now with the main driver being the second highest net realized gain amount that has been achieved since ARCC's inception.</li> <li>The weighted average spread over SOFR for the newly funded loan investments came in at 580 basis points, which implies a spread widening by about 20 basis points compared to the previous quarter.</li> <li>Non-accruals decreased from very low base of 1.2% in Q2 to 1.0% now.</li> <li>The underlying portfolio company credit profile improved as the TTM EBITDA continued to trend upwards.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, the management in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834260-ares-capital-arcc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> made it very clear to the audience that it is strongly committed to maintaining the existing dividend distribution amounts unchanged:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As a starting point, in the third quarter of 2025, our core earnings continued to exceed our dividend. Second, during the last period of rising short-term interest rates in 2022 to '23, we intentionally set our dividend at a level equivalent to a 9% to 10% ROE, which is a level we have historically achieved through different interest rate cycles over the last 20 years. We set the dividend at this level because we believe we can sustain this level of profitability through market cycles. The third point worth highlighting on this topic is what we view as our unique financial position with multiple levers to expand earnings or offset headwinds solely from falling market rates.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, I know that many BDC investors like to pay attention to the undistributed spillover income, which in this case stands at $1.26 per share, representing more than 2 quarters of ARCC full dividend payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hearing all of this, you might wonder how in the world one could be bearish on ARCC when basically all of the key fundamentals remain robust and/or are improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will explain. There are some important details that are not so obvious. But before doing that, I would like to once again emphasize that I am not recommending shorting ARCC. Instead, my overall motivation to avoid ARCC is primarily linked to the availability of more compelling BDC risk-adjusted return alternatives in the market, such as the aforementioned KBDC and MSDL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I have two conceptual items here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the net investment income per share continued to decline, landing at $0.48 per share as of Q3, 2025. For me this was not a surprise because it is just inevitable that BDC portfolio yields will be going down in a lower base rate environment. So far, we have had only one 25 bps cut (and a second one right while I am writing this article), which has, by the way, only partially percolated through ARCC's books (it takes time). The portfolio-wide yield for ARCC has declined from 10.9% in Q2 to 10.6% now in Q3. Given that the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus estimate</a> on the near-term base rate cuts indicate a total of 75 bps reduction (at least), there is still a long way to go for ARCC to reach equilibrium portfolio yield. And here we have to understand that it is per definition that ARCC's NII per share generation will get negatively impacted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to introduce more details here:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>As per the most recent <a href=\"https://ir.arescapitalcorp.com/sec-filings\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-Q filing</a>, we can see that each 25 bps of a cut would translate to about $28 million of a drop in the net income or roughly 2% of the total ARCC's income result.</li> <li>If we factor in the already made cuts this year and additional 50 bps over the course of Q4, 2025 - Q1, 2026, the combined negative impact on the income generation would be between 6% and 8% as we have to remember that the first base rate cut that occurred earlier this year has not fully percolated through the system (e.g., private credit loans usually come with 3-month SOFR reset periods).</li> <li>On top of this, we have to add a headwind from the inflated non-accrual side, which as I will discuss below is currently below the <a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/ebe3744a-6542-4474-a326-25ea40cf93b6/assets/ARCC_Q2-25_Investor_Presentation_vF.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">historical average</a>. I think that assuming a convergence to the mean (i.e., an uptick of ~1.2% in non-accrual on a FV basis). It really depends on the specific case that goes to non-accrual, but a good rule of the thumb would be a synchronized NII per share drop.</li> <li>Finally, I have to mention the $2.15 billion of fixed rate notes that are currently outstanding with maturity dates kicking in on January, 2026 ($1.15 billion) and July, 2026 ($1 billion). Given the cost of debt that ARCC can achieve in the markets (<a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">low 5%</a>), there is about 2.5% (on a weighted average basis) of a drag from potential refinancings. On an annualized basis this implies ~$50 million of an interest expense headwind - i.e., ~1.75% of a drop in net income.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, by summing all of the variables together, we arrive at 8% to 10% of a near-term income reduction (by near-term I mean next 12 month period).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, considering that the quarterly base dividend is at $0.48 per share, it means that currently base dividend coverage is 100%. Namely, there is no margin of safety left for ARCC to cover the dividend with NII.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, while I fully appreciate ARCC's ability to underwrite investment at higher than average spreads that have lower than average risk, I just think that it would be only prudent that we factor in some kind of normalization (i.e., a scenario in which not everything works out perfectly as in this quarter).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, speaking of non-accruals, the current level of 1.0% (on FV basis) is below ARCC's historical average of around 2.2%. Sooner or later, there will be an upswing here, especially if we take into account the prevailing macro backdrop, which seems increasingly more uncertain/risky.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also hard to imagine how ARCC could keep recognizing almost record beating net realized gains. The only reason why in Q3 ARCC was able to hit the significant figure was the sale of Potomac Energy Center, which was previously underperforming investment, placed on a non-accrual. Potomac resulted resulted in $262 million of net realized gain. For the context, over the past four quarters (excluding Q3, 2025), the average net realized gain position was actually negative $7.25 million. Plus, it happens very rarely that an underperforming asset gets restructured and monetized at gain (not loss) - i.e., we can consider it a one-off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I have to say that the earnings quality is not trending in the right direction. As of Q3, 2025, PIK consumed ~7.5% of the total income, marking an increase of around 12% on a year-over-year basis (similar dynamic if we compare to the previous quarter). From this we can extract two takeaways:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>On a cash-basis, the current dividend is undercovered.</li> <li>It seems that the spread widening for new deals was to a some extent enabled by a change in underwriting standards (as evidenced by higher share of PIK income component in Q3 than in the previous quarter, and management's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834260-ares-capital-arcc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">commentary</a> on going into the LMM segment to search for higher spreads), which is, obviously, the right thing to do in order to combat the forthcoming pressures form lower base rates, but a risky game to play in the long-term.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC is certainly a high-quality BDC and the Q3 data clearly support it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, in investing it is not only about value, but also about price you pay for it. While there is certainly a valid case for assuming premium pricing for ARCC, I still just don't see a justified ground for a) ~18% premium to <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">sector median</a> and b) similar gap from the likes of KBDC and MSDL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to ARCC's total return performance for the next 12-month period, my assumption would be that there will be a NAV decline, which should motivate the market to either reprice the stock or at least price ARCC in a more negative fashion than, say, KBDC and MSDL (i.e., comparable BDCs with significant discounts). At the same time, I do not think that the the NAV drop would be as deep as we could imply from my aforementioned 8% to 10% income decline (even though there is no surplus after dividend distributions). We have to remember that ARCC has the ability to issue new equity at NAV and that it has a spare financial capacity to accommodate organic portfolio growth, which is inherently accretive provided that there are no non-accruals offsetting that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the dividend, in my humble opinion, ARCC's NII per share will continue to go down due to systematic headwinds - mostly lower base rates and continued spread compression. Again, I do not think that in the next 12-month period we will see 8% to 10% of a decline in the NII per share (as the pure math would suggest) and thus deeply under covered dividend because of the same exact reasons that I provided on the NAV component. Namely, ARCC has the ability to expand portfolio in an accretive manner and, on top of that, it has a notable undistributed spillover, which could be used for a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the only scenario under which I could see ARCC cutting its dividend in the next 12-month period is if the pace and magnitude of base rate cuts accelerate (think of new Fed chair being a clear monetary dove) and there are new material non-accruals emerging (think of ARCC's PIK share and general weakness in the economy), which send the stock price below NAV and make the shortfall in the dividend coverage even deeper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I think that ARCC is a hold. It is not a sell due to relatively balanced P/NAV (1.02x) and the potential that lies in the spare financial capacity that could come in handy for offsetting the pressures from lower base rates and new non-accruals, where the latter aspect has been historically well-managed by ARCC.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I do not think that ARCC is a buy either. Putting all of the aforementioned pieces together, I simply do not see how ARCC could deliver positive growth that would justify experiencing material NAV growth and thus share price increase. The decision to not invest in ARCC is for sure made easier by the fact that relatively comparable BDCs such as MSDL and KBDC trade at rather steep discount to ARCC (18% in KBDC's case and 19% in MSDL's case) - i.e., in a nutshell, ARCC's strengths are not sufficient to fully justify such a gap in the valuations.</p>",

We sold the position and reallocated to what we view as higher-quality EQV stocks, including <strong>Heidelberg</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLBZF\" title=\"Heidelberg Materials AG\">OTCPK:HLBZF</a>) and <strong>Saint-Gobain</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CODGF\" title=\"Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A.\">OTCPK:CODGF</a>) that we believe are better positioned in favorable construction themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CGI</strong>, a Canadian IT services firm, has been in our view a solid long-term performer. However, weakening demand, AI-related disruption risks and pricing pressure raised concerns about its competitive advantage, prompting us to sell the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Wolters Kluwer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WOLTF\" title=\"Wolters Kluwer N.V.\">OTCPK:WOLTF</a>)</strong>, a Dutch information services company, faced deteriorating earnings and slowing organic growth.

Underweights in utilities and real estate also added to relative results. Geographically, exposure in the US (categorized by country of risk) and stock selection in Hong Kong and Australia contributed to relative return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock selection in financials detracted the most from relative return, with notable weakness in financial exchanges. Holdings in consumer discretionary, materials and IT also underperformed their respective benchmark sectors, detracting from relative results. An underweight in materials hampered relative return as well. Geographically, stock selection in Japan, the UK and China were key detractors from relative results, as was an underweight in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Contributors to performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below are some of the largest contributors to absolute return for the quarter:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor</strong> beat second quarter earnings expectations and raised guidance. Strong AI chip demand, pricing power in advanced nodes and favorable foreign exchange trends boosted profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Legrand,</strong> a global specialist in electrical and digital building infrastructures, outperformed as revenue and margins beat expectations, supported by its data center “white space” business, which designs, builds and optimizes physical floor space of data centers. A recovery in real estate markets could further boost upside potential. <strong>Trip.com,</strong> China’s leading online travel agency, benefited from domestic travel growth and expanding international operations. Margins exceeded forecasts due to lower marketing spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Detractors from performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below are the largest detractors from absolute return for the quarter:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Shimano</strong> is a global leader in bike components. Profit margins fell short of expectations due to product rollout costs and overseas labor pressures. High bike inventories, especially in China, have remained a short-term drag, but we expect this to normalize over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>RELX</strong> is a London-based provider of data analytics and decision tools (including Elsevier and LexisNexis). Potential disruption from AI, particularly in its Legal and Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) segments, weighed on the stock’s valuation. Despite the company actively integrating AI into its offerings, apparent market skepticism and a high valuation prompted us to trim the position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>London Stock Exchange,</strong> a leading global market infrastructure and data provider, saw a decline in its stock price, driven by AI concerns about its Workspace and Refinitiv Eikon platforms, as well as rising competition. We believe the market currently undervalues its data/analytics business and its AI partnership with Microsoft (not a fund holding).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1724\" data-height=\"503\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Standardized performance (%) as of September 30, 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>Expense ratios per the current prospectus: Class A: Net: 1.27%, Total: 1.27%; Class R6: Net: 0.86%, Total: 0.86%; Class Y: Net: 1.02%, Total: 1.02%.</p> <p>Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher.

A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. <strong>Information Ratio</strong> is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. <strong>Standard deviation</strong> measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. <strong>Tracking Error</strong> is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The <strong>up and down capture</strong> measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. <strong>Maximum Drawdown</strong> is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. <strong>Weighted Average Market Cap</strong> is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. <strong>Price/earnings</strong> measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. <strong>Price to book</strong> measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. <strong>Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth</strong> measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. <strong>ROE</strong> is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. <strong>Long-term debt to capital</strong> measures a fund’s financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. <strong>Operating margin</strong> measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. <strong>Contribution to Return</strong> measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</p> <p><strong>Morningstar</strong></p> <p>Source: ©2025 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The company produces its own yarns, assemblage garments and distributes its own products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such vertical integration provides not just more opportunities to retain margins throughout the chain, but also helps with control and visibility, as the control also makes it easier for the business to implement key labor and environmental practices through its supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates some 90% of sales from activewear products and the remainder from inner wear, with some 75% of sales tied to printer and just a 25% retail exposure. The company employs some 50,000 workers, is heavily focused on operations at ¨home¨ (that being Central America and the Caribbean), with almost all sales generated from in-house manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates some $3.3 billion in sales as a standalone business, these being very profitable operations, with EBITDA margins reported around 25% of sales. The company has seen modest operational advancements over the past decade, in which revenues rose some 30% to $3.3 billion, a period in which operating margins rose from the mid-teens to the low-twenties. By far the biggest achievement is that of capital allocation, with nearly 40% of the shares being bought back over this period of time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Thoughts &amp; Massive Deal</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July, the company <a href=\"https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/news/2025-07/bgildan_publishes_q2_2025_earnings_results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> its second quarter results, calling for 2025 sales growth up in the mid-single digits, seeing sales just over $3.4 billion this year. Operating margins are seen moving up towards 22% of sales, suggesting that a $750 million operating profit number might be in the works.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A $50 stock was granted a $7.5 billion equity valuation based on a share count of 149 million and some shares. Net debt of $1.8 billion resulted in a leverage ratio around 2.2 times, with the pro forma enterprise valuation pegged at $9.3 billion. That values the business at 2.7 times sales, around 11 times EBITDA and with adjusted earnings seen around $3.50 per share, equity was valued at a modest 14 times multiple on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this was about to change, as the company <a href=\"https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/news/2025-08/bgildan-hanesbrands_pr_20250812_final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> its intention to acquire troubled peer <span></span>Hanesbrands in August, in order to create a leading global basic apparel leader. That deal valued <span></span>Hanesbrands at $4.4 billion, split 50/50 between the valuation attached to the equity and net debt assumed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal is designed to add the inner wear business of <span></span>Hanesbrands, in order to create a much more balanced business with much larger scale, one with revenues seen more than doubling to $6.9 billion as <span></span>Hanesbrands is even slightly larger in terms of sales. These scale benefits are key, with costs synergies seen reaching $200 million in year three post closing, that is equal to nearly 3% of pro forma sales!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both businesses are pretty much different, with <span></span>Hanesbrands focusing on inner wear, having more supply chains in Asia, which is a risk given the tariffs and being much stronger in retail instead of wholesale as well. The combination is set to employ over 90,000 workers with revenues split pretty evenly between active and inner wear as well as retail and wholesale outlets, having a more global exposure and certainly a more global supply chain.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Impact</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deal terms call for largely an exchange of stock, with investors in <span></span>Hanesbrands being given 0.102 shares of Gildan and $0.80 per share fore very share they own, valuing equity around $6.00 per share based on the unaffected share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on a share count of some 357 million shares, that implies little over 36 million shares of Gildan issued, with investors in HanesBrands´s given a 19.9% equity stake in the pro forma business with a share count of 185 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The cash component runs at less than $300 million, which in between existing net debt of $1.85 billion of Gildan and about $2.2 billion from <span></span>Hanesbrands, makes for a roughly $4.4 billion net debt load. Pro forma EBITDA is seen at $1.35 billion, for a 3.2 times leverage ratio, as this leverage ratio falls to 2.8 times if we factor in the two hundred million in synergies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company sees leverage come down to 2.6 times, but this lower ratio is likely the result of timing of the deal closing, and the potential to deleverage until that point in time, as well as proceeds from the anticipated investment of the <span></span>Hanesbrands activities in Australia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If all this works, the company sees a 20% compounded annual growth rate in the period 2026 until 2028, that is from a $3.50 per share number seen this year, which at the lower end of the range suggests earnings per share of around $6 per share by 2028.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors Like It</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors in Gildan, and thus <span></span>Hanesbrands, acted relieved on the back of the deal announcement as shares rose some 10% to the $55 mark in August upon the announcement, having risen further to $60 in the weeks thereafter. This move is for good reasons, that of greater market position, more diversified operations abut moreover targeted synergies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of October, Gildan <a href=\"https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/news/2025-10/bgildan_publishes_q3_2025_earnings_results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> third quarter results, as the results triggered some minor both upward and downward revisions in the full year guidance here, with operating margins seen slightly higher than previously anticipated, while free cash flows are seen pressured a bit. Amidst the halt of buybacks until the acquisition, net debt was actually down over a hundred million (sequentially) to $1.74 billion. Further importance was the commentary on the <span></span>Hanesbrands deal, already seen taking place later this year, or early in 2026, both being rather quick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, expectations have risen a bit as well, given a quick 20% return in the time frame of just a few months since the deal for <span></span>Hanesbrands has been announced. This is driven by anticipated earnings per share growth, but at the same time comes with leverage being on the increase, execution risks being apparent and synergies to be realized upon, with those cost savings being substantial by all means.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On paper there is much to like, driven by the significant synergies and earnings per share growth assumptions, however I have some reserves as well. This includes the fact that this is a Canadian-US acquisition, which is a bit more culturally sensitive these days. Moreover, with <span></span>Hanesbrands losing its US status to some extent, more political risks related to tariffs might be on the increase again, after the situation has been highly uncertain already here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, I am keen to watch the situation from here, but anticipating some hiccups down the road, I look forward to keeping a close eye on the business and are considering on potential and frankly anticipate hiccups here down the road.</p>",

Unfortunately, 7 team members were killed in the tragedy where ~800,000 metric tons of wet material entered the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine from the former Grasberg open pit and traveled rapidly to multiple levels of the mine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freeport-McMoRan reported Q3 results generally close to expectations, but the company expects major impacts to mining activities into 2026. The company is currently investigating the incident and working to remove the mud from the facilities through year end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The copper miner <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4498336-freeport-mcmoran-plunges-after-lowering-forecast-for-q3-copper-gold-sales\">submitted a plan</a> back on September 24 to restart some unaffected areas during Q4, followed by a phased restart and ramp-up of the Grasberg Block Cave mine during 2026. Management is forecasting a reduction in 2026 production by ~35% of pre-incident estimates at 1.7 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freeport-McMoRan plans to hold a conference call with analysts and investors on November 18 to update the market on the multi-year financial outlook in lieu of holding a Q3<span></span> '25 earnings call. The company would appear to suggest a full return to normal operations by 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key to the copper market is that the loss of 1.7 billion pounds of production will only contribute to much higher prices than otherwise. Copper currently trades near the all-time highs at $5.14/lb.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"842\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kitco</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morgan Stanley has recently predicted the <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/copper-price-hits-record-in-london-on-supply-worries/#:~:text=Stock%20image.,of%20the%20US%2C%20he%20added.\" rel=\"nofollow\">most severe copper shortage</a> in more than 20 years.

Analysts are predicting the following annual numbers:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>EPS - $2.79</li> <li>Revenue - $31.5 billion</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freeport-McMoRan lists a $3.0 billion cash balance with a debt level of $9.3 billion. The copper miner has a net debt level of $6.3 billion, placing the company in a strong position with the expectation for an insurance recovery of up to $1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company faces a tough road ahead fully restarting GBC mining operations, but the business shouldn't see a major hit due to the higher copper prices from the lower output leading to a major copper shortage. Copper mines are difficult to develop, leaving a limited supply that can reach the market and replace the lost production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk is naturally a much longer period of ramping up production at Grasberg and even potentially some level of higher capex to get the GBC back operational with upwards of 300 million pounds of copper at risk. The company has a solid financial picture, and naturally any scenario where copper prices actually plunge in the next year would harm the business when most vulnerable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that Freeport-McMoRan has already rebounded from a mid-September update that caused a major selloff. Investors should use any future weakness in the stock to load up on the copper miner with signs 2027 capacity will return to normal and the copper market will face severe shortages. The company shouldn't face any long-term impacts from a mining incident, and investors should use market dislocations to add the copper miner.</p>",

In addition, the annualized returns in its different time frames show a minimal difference versus market price, indicating that the creation/redemption mechanism (APs + market makers) minimizes premiums/discounts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, there are no surprises in the tracking difference of NAV returns versus index returns. The ranges are consistent with an expense ratio of 0.35% +/- the effect of income from the securities lending part, sampling and rebalancing costs of an “equal weighted” index (which involves a higher turnover vs a cap-weight and therefore higher costs).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted earlier, NAV and market price have been in near-perfect alignment: they coincide in the 1 and 10 year tranches, while they barely differ in 1-2 bp in 3 and 5 years. Therefore, the price of the market share correctly reflects the value of the underlying basket and suggests that average discounts/premiums are low with good market depth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XOP Yields\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, XOP has a modest 30D <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP/dividends/scorecard\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP/dividends/scorecard\" target=\"_blank\">yield of 2.49%</a> that adds to the position of investors and reinforces the thesis of the fund proposal based on the exposure to the beta of the E&amp;P segment and not maximize coupons/dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Friendly reminder: this is a cyclical sector</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1320\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XOP Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>XOP SPDR® S&amp;P® Oil &amp;

It is built with three pieces in z-score:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>z_WTI : The price of standardized WTI crude oil in z-score over a moving window (weekly).</p></li> <li><p>z_HH: Henry Hub gas price standardized in z-score (weekly).</p></li> <li><p>z_Inv_inv: U.S. commercial crude oil inventories inverted and standardized; measures tightness. It is inverted because less inventory implies a tighter market and is a positive reading, thus aligning the logic of the movement with the other series.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The formula for obtaining the Physical Tightness Composite applies a weight of 60% to prices (giving more importance to crude than to gas in a ratio of 70-30) and 40% to the physical stress (low inventories). This gives the formula: Physical Tightness Composite = 0.6*(0.7*z_WTI + 0.3*z_HH) + 0.4*z_Inv_inv.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To interpret it, when the series is above 0 is a positive indicator that can be given by prices above their recent averages and/or contained inventories. Meanwhile, when it is below zero the context is unfavorable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a rule, since a z-score measures how many standard deviations a variable is from its recent average, stretches above +0.5 are not considered “one-week noise” and anticipate tailwinds. I would apply the opposite in -0.5.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financial Conditions Composite\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Financial Conditions Composite</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the other part of the macro analysis, we will use the Financial Conditions Composite. This signal brings together in a single weekly index three legs that influence the valuation and financing of E&amp;P:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>z_HY_inv: spread high yield (HY OAS) in inverted z-score. Because the lower the credit, the better, it is reversed to match the logic.</p></li> <li><p>z_Real_inv: real rate 10Y (DFII10) in inverted z-score; reversed by the same case: low real rates → best discount.</p></li> <li><p>z_USD_inv: Broad U.S. Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS) in inverted z-score. It is also reversed because a weak (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW\" title=\"Lowe's Companies, Inc.\">LOW</a>) USD is positive for refinancing other economies and is beneficial for commodities (DTWEXBGS is used against DXY because it better represents the “global” USD that affects oil demand and price formation).</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this case, the signal is composed of a weighted average in which greater weight is given to the credit leg (z_HY_inv): 50%, followed by z_Real_inv with 30% and finally, 20% for z_USD_inv. Thus, the formula we use is: Financial Conditions Composite = 0.5*z_HY_inv + 0.3*z_Real_inv + 0.2 * z_USD_inv.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To analyze it, values above 0 suggest a favorable financial environment that can be given by contained spreads, lower real rates and/or a less strong USD. Below zero, we would be in an unfavorable environment. Likewise, the logic would be applied that when the composite is in a stretch above +0.5 , we would speak of tailwinds for the E&amp;P and vice versa when the value is &lt; -0.5. Close to its historical average (zero), we would treat it as a neutral regime, in which case it is better to wait for movements to either side to draw conclusions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Physical Tightness Composite Zoom\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Physical Tightness Composite Zoom</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyzing both composites, after two attacks of Physical Tightness to break the rise first in January and June this year, failed to consolidate momentum and since then the trend has been downward, recently standing at -0.60. This is a sign of an unfavorable environment, in which the clearly determining factor is a below-normal price of oil. A rebound in the price of crude oil, news of a decline in production, or a further narrowing of inventories, would help reverse the trend. However, financial conditions are shown to be in a positive zone of +0.69. So for the time being, neither real rates nor the strength of the dollar are holding back the sector's prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the physical backdrop against us and financial conditions supportive, the situation is prudent as a worsening of financial conditions would add to the negative effect of the physicist. Meanwhile, the baseline scenario for 3-6 months suggests that we will see a range with lateral-bearish bias for XOP, limited by the lack of physical support. Based on this, the suggested operation is to maintain the position and avoid adding / scaling in until we see an improvement of the Physical Tightness is seen. In the event that financial conditions change course and do not change the pattern of Physical Tightness, consider reducing positions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, our XOP ETF offers pure beta to the E&amp;P with equal weighting but at the same time brings greater volatility against cap-weighted alternatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Likewise, until a clear catalyst to boost oil and gas prices emerges, even with financial conditions in a favorable environment, the recommended stance is Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for your reading.</p>",

Results were impacted by weaker-than-expected demand from industrial end markets, and we believe some of the share price weakness also reflected profit-taking following strong performance in prior periods. From our perspective, these short-term dynamics do not alter the structural advantages of MonotaRO’s business model. The company continues to gain traction with large enterprise customers, who now represent over 30% of sales. These clients typically have higher lifetime value and are more likely to adopt MonotaRO’s value-added services, such as purchase management systems, which enhance customer retention and deepen relationships. Importantly, we believe MonotaRO’s value proposition lies in convenience, execution and product curation—qualities that are difficult to replicate in Japan’s fragmented MRO market. With a high-margin, asset-light model, a scalable platform and a long runway to expand share across businesses of all sizes, we continue to view MonotaRO as a high-quality, competitively advantaged business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Accenture, the global IT consultancy, was one of the largest detractors. </strong>The company’s operations are split roughly evenly between Consulting and Managed Services (outsourcing). While Accenture’s strategic pivot to AI in 2023 has driven a rapid increase in AI-related revenue and bookings (nearly doubling to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2025), investors have grown increasingly concerned about the longer-term impact of AI on its outsourcing business—revenue heavily reliant on billable hours. Moreover, the U.S. government’s DOGE initiative created a headwind, as federal contracts have historically represented about 8% of Accenture’s revenue. Despite these challenges, Accenture continues to grow, albeit at a below-normal rate in the recent period, while simultaneously investing in its workforce—now employing roughly 77,000 AI and data specialists, about 10% of its global staff—and returning billions of dollars to shareholders through double-digit increases in both dividends (+10% year-over-year) and share buybacks (+15%). While we acknowledge that market concerns about AI’s disruptive potential warrant consideration, we believe Accenture shares have been excessively punished (valuations are at 10-year lows). The stock has retreated to mid-2020 levels, even though earnings per share and FREE cash flow are more than 50% and 40% higher, respectively, than they were at that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Credicorp, the largest bank in Peru, was a leading contributor during the quarter.</strong> Results exceeded expectations, supported by robust loan growth—particularly in microfinance and retail segments—stable asset quality and disciplined cost management, even as Peru’s central bank cut rates. From our perspective, these outcomes represent the strength of a well-executed long-term strategy. Credicorp’s multi-pronged platform—anchored in banking, insurance and wealth management—offers durable advantages in an underpenetrated financial system. Its leading positions in microfinance (via Mibanco), pension fund management and investment advisory foster lasting customer relationships and recurring revenue through multi-product engagement. The company is also prudently expanding its digital ecosystem, enhancing efficiency and broadening access across income levels. Importantly, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, management has consistently prioritized long-term value over volume, allocating capital conservatively and maintaining disciplined underwriting. We believe this enduring combination of diversification, market leadership and risk-aware culture supports our conviction in Credicorp as a resilient business with the ability to compound value over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Erste Group Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKOF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Erste Group Bank AG\">OTCPK:EBKOF</a>), a leading retail and commercial bank in Central and Eastern Europe, was a primary contributor during the quarter. </strong>Shares rose following strong results, supported by healthy loan growth, stable deposits and solid fee income. Looking beyond near-term performance, Erste announced its intent to acquire a significant stake in Santander Bank Polska (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKZHF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Santander Bank Polska S.A.\">OTCPK:BKZHF</a>), one of Poland’s largest banks. This transaction would expand Erste’s geographic footprint into a structurally attractive market, adding scale and diversification while providing exposure to one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. As a retail-oriented bank with meaningful exposure to underbanked populations across Central and Eastern Europe, we believe Erste is well positioned to benefit as Central and Eastern economies grow, cross key income thresholds, and drive increasing demand for financial services. In addition, we believe ongoing cost efficiencies—particularly through increased use of technology—should further improve profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>(All MSCI index returns are shown net and in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.)</p> <p>Disclosures</p> <p>The opinions expressed herein are those of Aristotle Capital Management, LLC (Aristotle Capital) and are subject to change without notice.

Pure gross returns do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs or other fees and are supplemental to the net returns. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee, which includes trading costs and custodial fees, from the pure gross composite return. (From inception to 12/31/2015, the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee is 3.00% on an annual basis, or 0.75% quarterly. From 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2023, the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee is 2.00% on an annual basis, or 0.50% quarterly and 0.17% monthly from 1/1/2024 to present.)</p> <p>All investments carry a certain degree of risk, including the possible loss of principal. Investments are also subject to political, market, currency and regulatory risks or economic developments. International investments involve special risks that may in particular cause a loss in principal, including currency fluctuation, lower liquidity, different accounting methods and economic and political systems, and higher transaction costs. These risks typically are greater in emerging markets. While Large-capitalization companies may have more stable prices than smaller, less established companies, they are still subject to equity securities risk. In addition, large-capitalization equity security prices may not rise as much as prices of equity securities of small-capitalization companies. Securities of small- and medium-sized companies tend to have a shorter history of operations and be more volatile and less liquid.
