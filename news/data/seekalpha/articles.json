This isn't surprising considering latest key data prints like the labor market report weren't available. As a result, inflation was the only number for the FOMC to work with, which is only half the story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The paucity of data also reflects in the latest FOMC statement. It starts by alluding to \"Available indicators...\", compared to the starting remark in the previous statement that said \"Recent indicators...\". Following the change in starting point, it continues to affirm that economic activity has moderated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to labor market conditions, the Fed now says that \"...unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August\". Here, a mention of the month in question is worth highlighting since it reflects that the Fed is working with dated data right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Government shutdown indicates another cut...</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Would the Fed have acted any differently if more data were available? Unlikely. In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823959-fed-will-cut-rates-again\">previous article</a> following the FOMC meeting, it was clear that two more rate cuts can happen in 2025. One of them has come through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the current macroeconomic conditions, the case for another cut has only become stronger, even as the latest inflation print isn't entirely supportive of one. Here's how. The government shutdown has now lasted long enough to impact the economy negatively in Q4 2025. According to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/federal-shutdown-could-cost-us-economy-up-14-billion-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reuters report</a>, some 2% of GDP growth could be lost in the quarter as some spending will lapse. This could reflect in labor market data, which has already been weakening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...while inflation isn't entirely supportive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, inflation data so far isn't entirely supportive. In September, headline inflation rose for the second consecutive month to touch 3% YoY once more, marking the biggest rise in eight months (see chart below).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"689\" data-height=\"319\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Headline Inflation, %, YoY\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"296\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Headline Inflation, %, YoY <span>(Source: Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While a drop in core inflation to 3% YoY from 3.1% YoY in August is somewhat encouraging, is it enough to make up for a rise in the headline inflation? Maybe not. A look at the chart below shows that of the nine months YTD, the latest core inflation figure sits nicely in the middle of the range. While the number has been higher in four months, it has also been smaller in the remaining four.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"688\" data-height=\"326\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Core inflation, %, YoY\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Core inflation, %, YoY <span>(Source: Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is another rate cut in the offing?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the question now is whether the available data indicates the likelihood of another rate cut. Going by the Fed's recent actions, it would still appear so. First, inflation has been relatively de-emphasised. So, barring a significant upward movement in prices, it's unlikely to be the deciding factor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reserve is more likely to continue focusing on the labor market. It's instructive then, to consider the projections put forth in the Philly Fed's <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/spf-q3-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">quarterly survey</a> of professional forecasters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The survey expects the unemployment rate to inch up to 4.4% in Q4 2025 from 4.3% in Q3 2025, just shy of the Fed's own forecast of a 4.5% level. Payroll figures are also expected to drop to 70.7k in the final quarter of the year, 5.4% below the average level of 74.75k YTD. If these projections are accurate, the Fed will continue to have a case for a cut.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How the stock markets responded</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can then conclude that the outlook for interest rates remains unchanged. In this context, the stock market non-response makes a whole lot of sense. The S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">SP500</a>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a></span>) was up by a minuscule 0.05% in yesterday's trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>) moved in the opposite direction, but only just, dropping by 0.18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The NASDAQ 100-Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a></span>), (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a></span>) was the only key index to see some real movement. It was up by 0.45%, but this is more likely to have been driven by results from big tech companies like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) and Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) than interest rate movements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"870\" data-height=\"264\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US Equity Indices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where to invest now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With double digit percent increases in all key indices YTD, however, it's clear that investor sentiment remains relatively buoyant.

Its P/E ratio is at <a href=\"https://worldperatio.com/index/sp-500/\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost 29x now</a>, higher than the historical range of 19x-25x. This, combined with the Fed's cautiousness about the economy and the government shutdown's impact, balancing the investing portfolio with defensives is a good idea right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that sectors like consumer staples are in the red YTD (see chart above), there's an even bigger case to consider defensives now. Even healthcare has underperformed this year, what with the uncertainty stemming from the risk of massive import tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among consumer staples, in the past month I've covered tobacco stocks like Philip Morris (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>) and Imperial Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMBBY\" title=\"Imperial Brands PLC\">OTCQX:IMBBY</a>), both of which have a long-term Buy case in place. For healthcare, Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) looks good, so investors might want to look out for its Q3 2025 results due later today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If uncertainty were the defining term for the year, it only got underlined with the government shutdown underway. Even though the Fed has cut rates at yesterday's meeting, as widely expected, its lack of latest data on account of the shutdown is apparent in the statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This data paucity also leaves the question as to whether another rate cut will be delivered before the year comes to a close.

From this remediation, DRD produces saleable gold and silver, but mostly gold. At the same time, DRD is doing something good for the environment and improving the quality of life for the residents by eliminating sources of dust and wastewater. The company was founded in 1895 and is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. DRDGOLD Limited is a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold Limited.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>DRD Stock Performance Since Our Last Article</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our previous article, we suggested looking for a significantly lower share price to mitigate the spectre of headwinds from DRD as Africa’s high-cost producer, potentially materialising in a sort of undoing of some of the major work that record-high, bullish gold prices were doing to this company’s earnings, normally the primary driver of sentiment on the NYSE. On the gold bull market side, the precious metal continued to exhibit strong, still breathtaking upside potential, although the astonishing rise that far led us to fear that sentiment surrounding NYSE-listed DRD shares had become somewhat saturated and that a fasting period was needed to revive demand for DRD shares. In this context, we would like to point out that the increase in the “average gold price” achieved by DRD is crucial because it allows a company with high operating costs to still generate impressive profits, pave the way for the payment of dividends, advance growth plans, and influence the sentiment on the NYSE. And so, a 31% year-on-year increase to US$2,564/oz for the six months ended December 30, 2024, resulted in a 65% year-on-year growth in headline earnings to 112.6 South African cents per share for the six months ended December 30, 2024 (see DRDGOLD Limited's print screen interim results in our<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800994-drdgold-expansion-underway-stock-could-pull-back-bit-rating-downgrade\"> previous article</a>). Following this sub-period, DRD's “average gold price” continued its record-breaking upward trend, increasing 38.59% year-on-year to US$3,030/oz for the second half of the year ending June 30, 2025, resulting in an estimated 72.25% year-on-year growth in headline earnings to an estimated 148 South African cents per share for the second half of the year ending June 30, 2025. The average gold price and earnings for the second half of 2025, as well as their year-on-year growth, were mathematically estimated based on the first half of fiscal 2025 and<a href=\"https://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/DRD/FS_FY2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> full-year 2025 figures</a>. For the latter, DRD achieved an average gold price of US$2,797/ounce—a 35% year-on-year increase—and recorded headline earnings of 260.6 South African cents per share, a 69% year-on-year increase. Given these dynamics and their impact on market sentiment, it does not mean that these factors were not fully considered when we proposed to exploit a price decline to improve one's position, because this had its natural premise in first and foremost owning shares in DRD in light of our expectation of rising share prices, which ultimately allowed shareholders to benefit from this development: The market value of DRD shares listed on the NYSE gained +74.30%, representing a total return of +76.05% (including a dividend yield of 1.75%), thus outperforming the S&amp;P 500, the benchmark for the entire US stock market, which increased by 9.91%, as of this writing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Trigger for DRD Investors in 2025: The price of gold</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher gold prices have fully offset lower sales volumes and higher costs, as DRD, with an AISC of $1,716/oz, operates a more expensive gold production compared to the African region, and we conclude the comparison based on available data from<a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/gold-focus/2025/03/ever-upwards-aisc-distinct-regional-variations-are-emerging\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sarah Tomlinson</a>, Director of Mine Supply Metals Focus at the World Gold Council, which is not very recent but not so outdated either as to affect its utilization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"919\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot source: senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/DRD/FS_FY2025.pdf, accessed on October 28, 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Screenshot source: senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/DRD/FS_FY2025.pdf, accessed on October 28, 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tomlinson wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The regional average AISC for Africa in Q3’24 was US$1,532/oz, up 4% q/q and 14% y/y.

This supports the ambitious growth targets of Far West Gold Recoveries Proprietary Limited (“FWGR”) and extends the operating life of Ergo Mining Proprietary Limited (“Ergo”), primarily due to the robust rise in the gold price. Gold volumes were solid in the first half of fiscal year 2025 but were significantly impacted by the late and heavy summer rainfall in the third quarter (or first quarter of 2025).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Cash Flow Movements and Growth Initiatives of the Company</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company paid lower dividends in fiscal year 2025 than in fiscal year 2024: 431 million South African Rand in fiscal year 2025 compared to 731.7 million South African Rand in the previous year, resulting in cash savings. Cash flow reinvested in the company (\"CapEx\") amounted to 2,254.9 million South African Rand in fiscal year 2025, lower than the 2,985.7 million South African Rand in fiscal year 2024. As the majority of CapEx was used for growth investments in fiscal year 2025, we conclude that the company, which continues to have higher operating costs compared to other African gold producers, is currently benefiting from a lower-than-usual need for sustainable capital expenditure because:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A) Production at FWGR is stable and under control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">B) The photovoltaic system (“PV”) and the battery storage system (“BESS”) at Ergo (60 MW photovoltaic system and 160 MWh BESS) are leading to a decrease in electricity consumption. This is having a significant impact on DRD in terms of cost savings, as the company<a href=\"https://www.drdgold.com/component/jdownloads/?task=download.send&amp;id=365&amp;catid=135&amp;m=0&amp;Itemid=232\" rel=\"nofollow\"> states</a> that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>“electricity is Ergo’s fourth-largest operating cost item after labour, contractors and re-agents.”</p> <p>Source: \"Results booklet: Reviewed condensed consolidated financial statements and cash dividend declaration for the year ended 30 June 2025\", DRDGOLD Limited website, accessed on October 28, 2025.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital expenditures (\"CapEx\"), primarily used to finance growth initiatives: Although FWGR's ongoing investment projects require a 130% increase in capital expenditures to 1,559.3 million Rand in fiscal year 2025 (compared to 678.8 million Rand in fiscal year 2024), Ergo's substantial allocation for growth investments, which was 2,110.3 million Rand in fiscal year 2024, has decreased to just 340.1 million Rand in fiscal year 2025. This trend is likely to be viewed very positively by investors, as it signals that Ergo is completing and commissioning its key growth initiatives, particularly the photovoltaic plant and associated battery storage system. Since Ergo accounts for 72% of DRDGOLD's total gold production in kg (3,473 kg were produced for Ergo and 1,357 kg for FWGR in fiscal year 2025), it remains to be seen what impact this will have on production after the massive investments, while gold prices stay robust. The current status of the DRD business unit is as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FWGR</strong> and <strong>Ergo</strong> are the two gold segments with which DRD is realising its goal of gold production through mine tailings retreatment. Information on their composition, organisation, and location can be found in our previous analysis of DRDGOLD as well. We add here that <strong>Ergo</strong> is normalising from the Ergo 1 phase (2008–2023) of higher yields and throughputs to the current Ergo 2 phase, with a tailings rate capped at 1.65 million tonnes per month until August 2026 and then up to 1.8 million tonnes per month for the entire remaining operating life of Ergo beyond 2040. Ergo will process a resource base consisting of 6.7 million ounces of M&amp;I resources (including reserves) and 0.2 million ounces of inferred resources as of December 30, 2024. This is supported by hundreds of hectares of land connecting Johannesburg to Soweto (“South Western Townships”), a large and vibrant urban complex that is now more than ever known for its post-apartheid identity. Reclaiming this area will eliminate the enormous pollution caused by dust and water management, so it's easy to imagine that the necessary permits can be obtained without excessive problems. At <strong>FWGR</strong> operation near Carletonville in the western part of the Gauteng province of South Africa, the throughput rate will be significantly increased from 0.6 million tonnes per month in Phase 1 of the FWGR to 1.2 million tonnes per month in Phase 2 of the FWGR. Completion is planned for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. Financing is currently entirely internal. FWGR will process a resource base consisting of 2.26 million ounces of M&amp;I resources (100% P&amp;P reserves) and no inferred resources as of December 30, 2024.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Strengthened Financial Condition</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating cash flow increased by 90.3% year-on-year, primarily due to the gold price, from South African rand 1,845.2 million in fiscal year 2024 to South African rand 3,511.1 million in fiscal year 2025. At the same time, capital expenditures and dividend payments decreased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash and cash equivalents increased by 150% year-on-year in fiscal year 2025 to South African rand 1,306.2 million, compared to South African rand 521.5 million in fiscal year 2024. At the end of the fiscal year, the company remained debt-free, and DRD's financial position had significantly improved. This secures future dividends and growth, particularly through two factors:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A) The production expectation for gold production in the coming years, at least until 2028, with a vision of 200,000 ounces per year, is projected to be between 140,000 and 150,000 ounces, with operating cash costs of approximately R995,000/kg, compared to 155,288 ounces with operating cash costs of R903,824/kg in fiscal year 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">B) Although the gold price trend is strongly upward, the scenario remains uncertain.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>But The Expected Gold Price Underpins DRD's Future Growth</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To achieve the 2028 target, DRDGOLD expects medium-term investments totalling approximately R7.8 billion or R3 900 million per year over the next 2 years. To this, we add our estimate of annual sustaining capital expenditure of approximately R4 835.9 million based on FY 2025 figures, which means that DRD’s total annual capital expenditure would be around R8 735.9 million per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We estimate the annual capital expenditures for sustaining operations as follows: The “All-in sustaining costs” for DRDGOLD in fiscal year 2025 amounted to ZAR 1,001,214/kg or US$1,716/ounce, based on an average exchange rate of ZAR/US$18.15. DRDGOLD produced 155,288 ounces or 4,830 kg of gold in fiscal year 2025. Therefore, the “All-in sustaining costs” for DRDGOLD, based on the amount of gold produced in fiscal year 2025, amounted to ZAR 4,835.9 million or US$266.5 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRDGOLD's estimated annual capital expenditures (sustaining and growth CapEx) amount to 8.8 billion Rand, which, with an annual gold production of 150,000 ounces, equates to R58 667 per ounce. As one South African Rand is currently equivalent to US$0.05809, DRDGOLD's annual (total) capital expenditures in US dollars amount to US$3,408 per ounce. The expenditures are ambitious, and in order for investors to remain optimistic about the future strength of the margin that will guarantee profits and dividends, they can only place their hopes on the development of the gold price. Wall Street remains optimistic about the future, although the pause in safe-haven assets due to the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal caused a setback in the gold price earlier this week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold Spot Price (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\">XAUUSD:CUR</a>) was $4,028.00 per ounce at the time of publication, representing a 51.58% increase year to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-sinks-below-4000-as-investors-sell-safe-haven-assets-on-china-us-trade-deal-203316587.html?.tsrc=372&amp;ncid=crm_-1855326-20251028-1--A&amp;bt_user_id=xzQU1RPnY6KFXPpifOCA7GpWcVI5lbYDC/Winmlr5TZ6PRBM9nlkaowUcgQQ63mHUKC35Ywidn6jlJ5/tt7rPd9h/EKcsj7CktZmaBE4/oczdUIjSeBvksTPyftttaOX&amp;bt_ts=1761645727891\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Yahoo Finance</a> highlights UBS Global Wealth Management's optimistic scenario of a gold price of $4,700 per ounce, and Bank of America analysts reaffirm their buy recommendation for gold with a peak of $6,000 per ounce by mid-2026, and Goldman Sachs predicts a price of $4,900 per troy ounce by the end of 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time of this article, DRDGOLD Limited's shares, traded on the NYSE under the symbol \"DRD\", were trading at $24.13 per share, representing a market capitalisation of $2.05 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1252\" data-height=\"481\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source for screenshot: seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/chart, website accessed on October 29, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source for screenshot: seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/chart, website accessed on October 29, 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has traded between $8.38 and $31.91 per share over the past 52 weeks. The trailing 12-month dividend is $0.40 per share, representing a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 1.66%. The dividend yield of the<a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield\" rel=\"nofollow\"> S&amp;P 500</a> is 1.13% as of this writing. Earnings per share are 260.6 South African cents (\"cps\"), or US$1.47, for the full year 2025. Based on the current market valuation, this results in a price-to-earnings ratio (\"TTM P/E ratio\") of 16.41, while the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/valuation/metrics\"> sector’s median</a> is 23.29x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock appears reasonably valued, and the moving average suggests that a near-term upward trend dominates the sentiment surrounding DRDGOLD's NYSE shares and that this trend, as long as rising gold prices in conjunction with the progress of the company's growth plans and realistic, albeit ambitious, spending act as upward drivers, has the potential, as confirmed by the 200-day moving average, to be maintained in the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The RSI is currently at 41.67, correcting from the overbought levels of late September 2025. This could indicate some indecisiveness in demand for DRDGOLD shares, particularly after the recent visible drop in the gold price following the ceasefire in the Middle East and the prospect of a US-China trade agreement. However, this is likely to be temporary, and DRD shares are expected to trade within a neutral range just in the short term. We believe that this phase will soon give way to a renewed upward movement, fueled by a renewed awareness of DRDGOLD's robust prospects. The trigger will be the gold price: once the ounce stabilises at a healthier level after the correction, the price will resume its strong upward trend. The global environment continues to show interest in gold as a safe haven, while the likelihood of two further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve by the end of 2025 is further fueling demand for gold, although it does not yield any income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRDGOLD, a South African gold producer that extracts gold from the processing of tailings piles from former open-pit mine activities, is a cost-intensive producer. But the record rise in the gold price makes buying its shares a sensible option. The company has an ambitious investment budget to secure a promising future for its gold business. The impressive gold price, which has already risen by almost 60%, provides the best possible conditions for this. DRDGOLD generates positive free cash flow to distribute dividends to the shareholders of DRDGOLD Limited. Despite the recent decline in the price per ounce, Wall Street remains very optimistic about the future performance of the gold price. Rising profits and progress on the company's growth plans will positively influence sentiment on the New York Stock Exchange regarding DRDGOLD shares.</p>",

On<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the year, GDP was up 0.4%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As usual at the preliminary estimate stage, Istat did not provide a detailed demand breakdown. We just know that domestic demand (gross of inventories) acted as a drag, while net exports were growth supportive. The supply-side angle shows an increase in value added in agriculture, stability in services, and a contraction in industry - a pattern broadly consistent with confidence data published throughout the summer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today’s release confirms a picture of stagnation, where the impact of US tariffs on trade flow data has yet to settle. We had expected some rebound in the external component, which had subtracted 0.7% from quarterly GDP growth in the second quarter, and it seemed sensible to assume less of a push coming from inventories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We suspect that at the heart of the flat reading, there's another flat quarter for private consumption and a small contraction in investments. Apparently, the peak tourism season did not work its magic this summer, notwithstanding solid international tourist flows. Domestic consumers still seem to be taking a prudent approach - the savings ratio in the third quarter remained above average. On the investment front, tariff-related uncertainty might have weighed on business decisions in the machinery domain, leaving the onus for growth on the infrastructure component, which is still driven by inflows of EU recovery funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, today’s GDP release shows that the Italian economy is stagnating. October confidence indicators were generally improving for both consumers and businesses, except for services, marking a decent start to the last quarter of 2025. Also, on a positive note, the labour market remained resilient in September, with employment posting a decent monthly gain and the unemployment rate at 6.1%, hovering around historical lows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentals remain consistent with some improvement on the consumption front in a low-inflation environment. We thus stick to our forecast of a small positive GDP growth in the fourth quarter, leaving average GDP growth for 2025 at 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Not only is CAC potentially higher than initially reported, but the economics of the business might also be worse.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, I believe the name <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805223-travelzoo-q2-does-not-shed-clarity-on-new-business-model-profitability-yet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805223-travelzoo-q2-does-not-shed-clarity-on-new-business-model-profitability-yet\" target=\"_blank\">remains</a> a Hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another Quarter Of Unprofitable Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Travelzoo posted a quarter with revenues up almost 10%. The growth was entirely explained by higher membership fees and revenues generated by their relatively new membership-based model (implemented in 2024). Advertising revenues were flat YoY, with a decrease sequentially that can be fully explained by seasonality (1H25 has better seasonality because of Spring/Summer in the Northern Hemisphere).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The higher revenues were accompanied by a negative contribution across every line of the income statement. Gross margins decreased, Opex increased, and operating income went down 90%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Data On Membership Economics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has been commenting for several quarters, and provides several explanations in its presentation that the lower operating margins come from higher investments in <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Presentation-FINAL-v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Presentation-FINAL-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">member</a> acquisition. Because member fees are recognized ratably, but the CAC is recognized immediately, the accounting makes it look as if the company's margins decreased, when they are increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have been wary of this dynamic, commenting that although it makes sense, it is also hard to determine the actual profitability of the new membership business. This quarter has not changed the situation, but it has built up more data, which makes me more confident that the economics of the business are not very good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the company says that the new users, after being acquired, should be accretive to earnings (the cost of acquiring has already been expensed). If that were the case, we should either see a higher level of growth (because more is being invested) or a higher level of profitability. We found none of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can estimate the number of users by looking at membership revenues per quarter and dividing by $10 ($40 a year for Travelzoo membership). It is an approximation, but I think it works. Based on that, the company has added 60 thousand net new members per quarter since <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q24\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">4Q24</em>. This implies the pace of growth has not increased. Therefore, the profitability should have increased QoQ, because older members are not expensed as CAC. And yet, profitability has worsened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the cash change in deferred revenues does not show that level of improvement in users. If a user pays $40 upfront, and $10 is recognized as new revenue in the quarter (actually less than that because the member might join after the quarter starts), then deferred revenues should grow by about $30 by the amount of net new members. However, deferred revenues on the <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/EX-99-1-09-30-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/EX-99-1-09-30-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">release</a> grow by only $643 thousand, or 20 thousand members, not 60 thousand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this line, the company says that although it affects GAAP earnings (because of accrual recognition), it should not affect cash flows, because users pay upfront. However, we see that the CFO, before working capital remains low, at about $640 thousand for the quarter ($1.3 million when adding deferred revenues),</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, the company's CAC might be higher than reported when considering all factors involved. The company reports a CAC of $40 per user (basically the same cost as a year of membership fee revenues). With 60k net new adds, the cost should have been $2.4 million. However, YoY S&amp;M costs increased $4 million, and are also higher sequentially. This is much closer to actual GAAP profitability for the quarter ($500 thousand) than to the profitability a year ago ($4 million). This implies the economics are not only GAAP but also cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the same line, CoGS increased by another $2 million. The company has commented in the last call and in previous ones that the higher CoGS comes from offering better deals to members, which reduces the margins on the trips sold. That should be part of CAC, as it reduces gross profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I worry about are <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">two</em> factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the net additions require many more gross additions, because many users simply cancel, and therefore the actual CAC per net user is higher (explaining the increase in S&amp;M expenses, both annually and sequentially).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the business has extremely low margins, because the (reported) CAC is the same as the membership fee, and the revenues from sales of packages are low margin because they are offering cheap deals to justify the membership (therefore, gross margins fall).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">None of the comments above implies an accusation about any wrongdoing from management or misreporting. Rather, these are speculations about the potential economics of the new businesses, which will become more evident as time passes by.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Repurchases Continue As Owners Sell</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have commented in previous articles, it is strange that the company continues to repurchase shares while the owners sell. In the last quarter, the company repurchased about $1.5 million in shares, and almost $13 million for the YTD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">three</em> months, the largest shareholder of the company, <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tzoo/insider-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tzoo/insider-activity\" target=\"_blank\">Azzurro Capital, sold</a> about 220 thousand shares, which at a current price of $8 imply ~$1.75 million, or more than the company purchased itself. Over the last <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"twelve\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">twelve</em> months, the largest shareholder, which is controlled by the company's founder (also brother of the current CEO, see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18385703\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18385703\" target=\"_blank\">proxy</a>), has sold almost 950 thousand shares, or almost $15 million if we consider an average price over the year of about $15 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Is Not Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have maintained a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/quipus-capital/analysis?ticker=tzoo\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/quipus-capital/analysis?ticker=tzoo\" target=\"_blank\">fairly consistent</a> Hold rating on TZOO, especially since the company announced the changes to its business model. At this point, the company trades at one of the lowest valuations in the past <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">two</em> years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, I do not believe it is attractive yet. The data from the past quarters fails to convince me that the new membership model is attractive economically. Rather, I believe the economics are subpar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, the largest shareholder is selling large quantities of stock, which does not bode well for the prospects of the business, even if other reasons could be behind the selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the prospects macroeconomically are not fantastic, with fears that consumer discretionary spending (of which travel is an important category) will decrease as the economy manages the impact of tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, Travelzoo has rarely generated a net income above $10 million, which would remain fair for a valuation like the current one, of about $95/100 million. The time when the business made that much money was related to the post-COVID travel boom, and is unlikely to repeat soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, the company operates simply at operational breakeven. According to management, this is all because of growth investments, but I have reasons to believe the economics of the business are just worse than they were before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, I believe the current price is not attractive, and therefore maintain a Hold rating on Travelzoo.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

And investors collect a 3%+ dividend yield while they wait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I discuss their latest earnings, fundamentals, and why long-term dividend investors should consider the AI benefactor Prologis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4664522-prologis-q4-earnings-high-quality-reit-thats-still-attractive-buy\">my last thesis</a> in January of 2024, PLD has faced their fair share of headwinds, resulting in volatility. In April, the REIT made a new 52-week low in the mid-$80s but has since recovered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite this, the stock is still slightly below their then share price, down roughly 2%. The S&amp;P has continued on its strong trajectory, carried by positive AI sentiment, up nearly 41% over the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2064\" data-height=\"860\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, their share price performance is not that surprising since I warned readers that the expected drop in occupancy as well as negative sentiment surrounding interest rates could result in further volatility. But Prologis' balance sheet, dividend, and upside potential to their price target of $150 made them attractive long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Beneficiary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prologis reported their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830199-prologis-inc-pld-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 earnings</a> earlier this month and managed to beat on both their top and bottom lines. As a result, the share price rallied and allowed management to raise full-year guidance across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core FFO amounted to $1.49, a beat by $0.05, and revenue to $2.21 billion, besting estimates by $180 million. While this is nothing to get overly excited about, Prologis' rally was more about the guidance raise than the beat on earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the market likely reacted positively to the record quarter in leasing. This amounted to 62 million square feet. They also continued expanding power capacity for data center buildouts. In Q3, PLD moved an additional 1.5 gigawatts to advanced stages, bringing the total to 5.2 gigawatts total.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This made the REIT one of the largest owners of utility-fed power readily available for data centers. They also signed an additional 9 build-to-suits in the quarter, bringing the total to 21 for roughly $1.6 billion of total investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their energy business also delivered 28 megawatts of solar generation and storage, bringing their current capacity to 825 megawatts. This brought the REIT closer to their 1-gigawatt expectation by the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, from a performance standpoint, PLD looks poised for future growth and to be a benefactor of the world's growing AI infrastructure. Unlike peer Rexford Industrial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REXR\" title=\"Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.\">REXR</a>), which is solely concentrated in Southern California, PLD has properties globally in 20 countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1220\" data-height=\"771\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>PLD fact sheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLD's NOI growth on an effective and cash basis was solid. Although, this was lower than the previous year's quarter at <strong>3.9%</strong> and <strong>5.2%,</strong> respectively. This declined from <strong>6.2%</strong> and<strong> 7.2%</strong> in Q3'24. And was likely due to continued softness and rent declines, particularly in their SoCal markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer Rexford Industrial managed to see higher NOI growth on a cash basis at <strong>6%</strong> in their Q3. On a net effective basis, this was lower at<strong> 2.9%</strong>. But REXR managed to see growth in both from the prior year's <strong>2.6%</strong> and <strong>5.3%,</strong> respectively.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Guidance Raise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously mentioned, Prologis' strong Q3 allowed management to raise their full-year guidance. Core FFO is now expected in a range of $5.78 - $5.81. This represents a growth rate of <strong>4.4%</strong> from 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth rate is lower than the high single-digit to double-digit growth Prologis and other industrial REITs are used to seeing. This was also lower than the <strong>8.4%</strong> growth they saw from 2023, an obvious sign of macro uncertainty and supply &amp; demand headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NOI growth is now expected to be between 4.25% and 4.75% on a net-effective basis and 4.75% and 5.25% on a cash basis. The REIT also raised development and disposition guidance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend &amp; Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since I last covered Prologis, the REIT raised its dividend from $0.96 to $1.01, continuing its solid streak of paid dividends. Additionally, dividends were covered by AFFO despite the slight dip from 2023 to 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the payout ratio is high, around <strong>91%</strong> currently, I don't expect PLD to cut its dividend any time soon. So, the 3+ yield is likely safe for the foreseeable future. But this is something investors should keep a close eye on, as I prefer REITs with more conservative payout ratios around 70%–75%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1427\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"190\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>PLD supplemental</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a positive note, PLD has additional sources of capital and an A-rated balance sheet, giving them plenty of flexibility for dividend sustainability.

Moreover, due to the likelihood of seeing continued softness in their markets, I don't expect significant upside from current levels, at least for the near to medium term. However, I do think they remain attractive over the longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For comparison, PLD's multiple was higher than both of its peers', Rexford Industrial and EastGroup Properties (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EGP\" title=\"EastGroup Properties, Inc.\">EGP</a>). REXR's forward P/FFO multiple was <strong>17.72x,</strong> while EGP, my favorite amongst the peer group, sits at <strong>19.98x.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <span></span>FAST Graphs, Prologis presents some upside from the current price of $127 to their price target of $135 by the end of 2027. For investors looking to buy, I would look for any share price weakness, preferably around $110 or below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2724\" data-height=\"1201\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>FAST Graphs</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is due to continued headwinds because of overall market declines, SoCal softness, and macro uncertainty.

As I explained in my recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831017-megi-collect-high-yield-income-from-global-utilities-and-infrastructure\">review of NYLI CBRE Global Infrastructure Megatrends Term Fund (MEGI</a>), lower rates increase the performance of the utility holdings by introducing capital gains in addition to lowering the cost of capital. Utility companies may experience benefits from lower rates but could also run into difficulties if there is a corresponding economic downturn, as explained in this <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/interest-rate-cut-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">US News report</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"Utilities are capital intensive with high debt burdens. A reduction in interest rates is likely to benefit margins.\" Still, Cluver cautions, \"Energy and materials both have high economic growth sensitivity and low interest rate sensitivity. As such, should economic growth concerns prompt a rapid reduction in yields, these sectors may struggle.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like MEGI, the abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASGI\" title=\"abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund\">ASGI</a></span>) is a relatively young CEF (with an inception date of July 2020) that offers high-yield income and the potential for capital appreciation from holdings in global utilities and related equities. Aberdeen makes it clear, however, that ASGI is focused on delivering high current income as its primary investment objective (i.e., capital appreciation is secondary), as explained on the fact sheet.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Fund's investment objective is to seek to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on current income.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In March 2024 I wrote about ASGI and rated the fund a <strong>Buy</strong> at that time, suggesting that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4678422-abrdn-global-infrastructure-income-fund-global-infrastructure-finds-sweet-spot-2024\">global infrastructure was in its sweet spot</a>. These were the summary bullet points from that article:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>The global infrastructure sector is likely to see a shift in sentiment in 2024 after a poor performance in 2023.</em></li> <li><em>Trillions of dollars in infrastructure investments are expected globally over the coming decade.</em></li> <li><em>Emerging trends of decarbonization, digitalization, and deconsolidation/deglobalization are expected to further stimulate infrastructure spending, creating investment opportunities.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, ASGI delivered a total return of nearly 45% since that article was published. Today, as ASGI has gone up in price over the past year, the discount has also vanished. At the current price and yield, I rate ASGI a <strong>Hold</strong>. This was what I wrote a year and a half ago when rates were still high.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As investors digest the latest news and economic reports, the fund price rises and falls based on the latest interpretation of what will happen to interest rates. For investors with a long-term view, those daily price gyrations offer potential buying opportunities when the price drops for no other reason than market sentiment.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now that rates have been cut twice in the past few months, investors have bid up the price of ASGI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1037\" data-height=\"786\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ASGI chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at an overview chart from CEFConnect, we can see that ASGI went from a rather large discount of almost -12% at the lowest point to a very small discount now, with a sideways trending NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1535\" data-height=\"881\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"discount price chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CEFConnect</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Income investors will be interested in the 12% distribution that has averaged close to $0.20 monthly since May 2024.

In September 2024, the fund completed the <a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?documentId=AA-220924-183309-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">reorganization</a> with the Macquarie/First Trust Global Infrastructure/Utilities Dividend &amp; Income Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most recently, the fund <a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?documentId=AA-121025-199631-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">completed the reorganization</a> with the ABRDN JAPAN EQUITY FUND, INC.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In the reorganization, common shareholders of JEQ received an amount of ASGI common shares with a net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their holdings of JEQ common shares, as determined at the close of regular business on October 10, 2025.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund managers appear to be preparing for future uncertainty and continued volatility. In the <a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?editionId=9e0060c3-26b1-493f-b66b-9b492bc1d074\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 2025 fund commentary</a>, the fund’s outlook and strategy are outlined, and it makes a compelling case for strong future returns due to Fed easing.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>With the Fed moving towards an easing cycle, this should be positive for infrastructure valuations, although this is not always reflected immediately, particularly given investors’ exuberance for all things related to artificial intelligence. An interesting observation – rather than an outlook – and perhaps somewhat linked to the Fed’s easing, is the performance of renewables over the past couple of months. After hitting their nadir due to the effective repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act by the Trump administration, we have seen renewed interest in the sector, as rising power prices driven by data centre demand mean returns still look attractive even without the tax credits.</p> <p>Looking beyond these near-term market fluctuations, infrastructure continues to stand out as an attractive investment opportunity, offering defensive characteristics and long-term value in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. We also believe infrastructure provides a compelling way to navigate volatility while benefiting from essential, irreplaceable assets. Amid the focus on near-term trends, it is important not to lose sight of the long-term structural drivers we see in infrastructure – namely the energy transition, digital acceleration, ageing infrastructure and increasing urbanisation.</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks: Valuation and Market Sentiment Drive Short-Term Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an income investor, I am mostly concerned with the monthly distribution.

The bigger issue in my mind is that the price has risen to the point of eliminating any margin of safety with respect to the discount to NAV. As the fund trades closer to the NAV and the prices of underlying holdings may experience some pricing pressure in a market correction, I would not be surprised to see ASGI sell off if we see a broader market downturn.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conversely, the news of lower rates could act to propel utilities even higher, in which case ASGI stands to benefit. I would not be a seller of ASGI at current prices, but I would not be a buyer here either. Existing shareholders may want to ride out any short-term price volatility and continue collecting the 12% distribution. For those looking to start a position, I suggest waiting for a better entry point in the coming months.</p>",

The decline in gold production from NGM is mainly attributable to the pit wall failure of the Gold Quarry open pit in Carlin in the first quarter of 2024, coupled with lower grades and recoveries, higher refractory ore processed, and the autoclave shutdown in Turquoise Ridge. Moreover, higher maintenance costs of underground and process facilities added upward pressure on other minesite costs related to equipment and spares. Other minesite costs rose 13.15% year-over-year, increasing average AISC by US$62.63/oz. Given Nevada Operations' significant production, changes in the mine's costs can greatly impact the average US AISC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, lower production impacted labor and electricity costs when expressed in US$/oz terms. Labor costs increased 10.77% and electricity costs went up 15.9% year-over-year, adding US$35.29/oz and US$13.54/oz, respectively, to average AISC. This was further exacerbated by 5.53% year-over-year growth in local power cost, combined with 93% of production sourcing power from the national grid. Labor, electricity and other minesite costs make up 58.03% of average AISC in the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, average AISC in Canada rose 3.14% year-over-year to US$1,512.76/oz, mainly attributed to increasing royalty costs, reagents and other minesite costs, and increased sustaining capital spending. Royalty cost drove most of the increase, up 36.11% year-over-year, adding US$28.80/oz to average AISC. Note that royalty taxes in Canada are based on profits and margins, translating to higher royalty costs when metal prices increase and operating costs remain steady or vice versa. Other minesite costs rose 1.35% year-over-year, adding US$5.21/oz to average AISC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Canadian gold producers have also increased their sustaining capital spending 2.69% year-over-year, adding US$7.72/oz to average AISC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SNL Image\" width=\"NaN\" height=\"NaN\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690221.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Wide margins in the medium-term outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From 2024 to 2027, we estimate average AISC decline at a CAGR of 4.52% in the US and 4.26% in Canada, based on consensus macroeconomic forecasts. This is on the back of declining minesite costs and tight sustaining capital spending. We estimate labor and other minesite costs to be the main drivers of decreasing minesite costs in both regions, while fuel costs will add downward pressure in the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decline in sustaining capital spending is in line with the guidance reported by major gold company producers. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEM\" title=\"Agnico Eagle Mines Limited\">AEM</a>) provided sustaining capital guidance of US$710 million in 2025 for its operating mines in Canada, down 4.60% year-over-year. While Barrick Mining Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B\" title=\"Barrick Mining Corporation\">B</a>) and Kinross Gold Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KGC\" title=\"Kinross Gold Corporation\">KGC</a>) did not report sustaining capex guidance for their mines in the US, their reported second-half 2025 sustaining capex was down 5.26% and 28.80%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2024, margins doubled year-over-year in the US and Canada on the back of the 25% increase in average gold price. We estimate a slowdown in margin growth in the US in 2026, followed by a rebound in 2027, while Canada's margin will widen until 2026 but decline in 2027. Overall, margins will increase in the US and Canada at a CAGR of 18.41% and 14.12%, respectively, from 2024 to 2027, remaining healthy on the back of declining average all-in sustaining cost amid steady average gold prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SNL Image\" width=\"NaN\" height=\"NaN\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_431690277.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2025/10/gold-all-in-sustaining-costs-in-us-canada-up-yoy-margins-to-widen-further\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

That's a lot, especially after two years of relative quiet in the share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When prices move a lot in a relatively short amount of time, it is natural for investors to get concerned and they want to talk about it more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don't blame them. The best thing to do is to try to understand the moving parts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Moving Parts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, we have NAV (Net Asset Value) – this is a number that is reported by OXLC every month. It represents the current fair value of OXLC's assets minus liabilities, divided by shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NAV is down. As of Dec 31, 2024, OXLC's NAV was $24.10 (adjusted for split). Since NAV is reported monthly, we can't state with certainty what it is today, but <a href=\"https://ir.oxfordlanecapital.com/news-market-data/press-releases/news-details/2025/Oxford-Lane-Capital-Corp--Provides-September-8-2025-Net-Asset-Value-Update/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">OXLC reported</a> its NAV as of Sept 8, 2025, as between $20.02 and $20.22. So, let's call it $20.12.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If OXLC traded at NAV, its price would have been down 16.5% as of Sept 8th. Its market price was down nearly twice that at -30% from Jan 1 through Sept 8, 2025. If OXLC simply traded exactly at NAV, as of Sept 8, 2025, it would have lost $3.98 in value, and it would have paid $3.60 in dividends for a total return of -1.6% as of Sept 8th. I'd dare say if that was the case, OXLC wouldn't be getting much attention.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Market Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, OXLC doesn't trade at NAV. It is a CEF, and unlike ETFs that trade at NAV, the price of a CEF is set by the market. Individual investors buying and selling influence the market price. As of Dec 31 2024, OXLC was trading at a 5.2% premium to NAV. On Sept 8 2025, it closed at $17.75, an 11.8% discount to NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, from Jan 1 to Sept 8, 2025, nearly half of the decline in OXLC's share price is attributable to the market changing from a premium to NAV to a discount to NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This change in the difference between NAV and market price can be a negative over certain timeframes. That the price is disconnected from NAV is a huge benefit for investors who can keep a clear head.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">2013 Letter to Shareholders</a>, Warren Buffett made a comparison between stocks and a farm that he had bought:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his – and those prices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state – how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market price in relation to NAV is a neighbor shouting out different valuations every day. However, there is an underlying asset. Regardless of what the neighbor is shouting, the farm might be a good farm that produces an abundant yield, or it could be a bad farm where crops struggle to grow.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The OXLC Income Farm</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, we know the current yield of the OXLC is very high. We know that the price our neighbors were shouting on Sept 8 was a steep discount to the NAV of this income farm. It is very likely in our estimation that the price being shouted today is an equally sizable and possibly larger discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last time OXLC traded at a price this low was in May of 2020, and its NAV (split adjusted) was $14.35-$14.85. Yes, OXLC was actually trading at a premium despite COVID, despite slashing its dividend in half, and despite default rates spiking. Despite trading at close to the same price as today, the total return over 5.5 years was over 160%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's the power of dividends. We don't need price increases. They're nice, but not an essential or even significant portion of our total return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, OXLC is trading at a steep discount. Its dividend is the same level as it was in 2023 and the first half of 2024. This is much higher than it was in 2021/2022 when its price hit the most recent peak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Default rates remain low relative to history. Yes, the First Brands bankruptcy filed in September will likely lead to a loss in many CLOs, but the average exposure was 0.24%. Default exposure for CLOs rose to 0.7% in September, <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/us-bsl-clo-default-exposure-rises-again-after-first-brands-default-10-10-2025\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">according to Fitch</a>. In 2020, serious people like Morgan Stanley and Blackstone <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/gso-impact-of-loan-downgrades-on-clos-may-2020-bglf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">were predicting</a> that CLO default rates could exceed 10%. In hindsight, they were wrong. But at that time, such an assertion wasn't crazy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Facts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let's step away from the drama and look at the facts.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>OXLC is trading at more than a 15% discount to NAV, when historically, it has traded at a premium even during distressed times.</li> <li>Today isn't a distressed time. Exposure to defaults among all CLOs is 0.7%, which is below average, albeit higher than we saw for most of the past few years.</li> <li>The best time to buy OXLC in history was when it was trading at today's prices, even though at that time those prices were a premium to NAV. (Today they are at a discount).</li> <li>Investors who sold in 2020 lost their shirts. Investors who held/bought saw significant upside in the following years.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Unknowns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, there are some unknowns. We know the OXLC farm yields a lot right now. We also know that yield isn't set in stone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2020, we saw OXLC slash its dividend in half when credit was being downgraded, and default rates did see a spike. Right now, defaults aren't high, and corporate credit appears quite solid. What's happening right now isn't what will happen forever. It is possible that it could fall apart and force a dividend cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OXLC is trading at a steep discount to NAV. That discount will probably be reduced, but it can decline in three ways. OXLC's price could rise, or its NAV could decline, or a combination of both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Right now, the credit markets aren't distressed - yet. There are certainly those who are hypothesizing that the credit markets will deteriorate soon. That fear is likely the primary reason why credit risk stocks are selling off, and OXLC is pure leveraged credit risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last time OXLC's NAV and price was this low, it was a screaming buy in 20/20 hindsight. At the time, people were saying it was too risky, the price being down so much proved it was a bad investment, COVID-19 would cause massive defaults, etc. As it turned out, defaults weren't as bad as feared, NAV bounced up, the price bounced up, and dividends were raised.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But past results do not guarantee future results. Investors feared a default wave, and for the most part, the defaults that did happen after COVID-19 were smaller, had higher recoveries, and occurred at a slower pace than feared. CLOs had some losses, but much less than many expected. OXLC's primary \"loss\" of NAV was from its decision to overpay the dividend. They declared 6-months of dividends before the crisis, and opted to payout those dividends even though they weren't anywhere close to covered by cash flow. If they had cut the dividend more quickly, like peers did, their NAV would have seen a higher recovery. I'm not going to hold that against them as someone who benefited from the overpayments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OXLC is trading at an absolute price and a valuation that we've only seen in the heart of a crisis. Even if there were going to be a crisis, one could argue that it is reasonably priced in. We believe that the default cycle is going to be relatively mild for credit. If we are right on that point, OXLC is a huge winner going forward. If we are wrong, then OXLC is probably ahead of the curve and has already priced in a crash that the rest of the market is going to catch up to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keep your position size at a level that can absorb fear-based price swings. That should be a routine practice with all investments. Make your assessment of what you believe will happen with corporate credit, and make your decision. All investments involve risk, and this particular investment revolves around whether corporations will pay their bills or go bankrupt. In the long run, that is the only thing that matters for determining how much OXLC will be able to pay in dividends in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will say, when there is a new drama diva in town, the best thing to do is to make your assessment, make your decision, and follow through. Keep your head clear, and focus on the things that actually matter, like default rates and cash flow. Don't get wrapped up in the drama of market price.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ultimate question you have to answer is \"will corporate default rates be high like the Great Financial Crisis, or low like COVID?\" We believe it will be low, and that's why we are taking advantage of OXLC's low prices.</p>",

It’s great for my ego and my portfolio.</p> <p>All kidding aside, sometimes, I would rather not be right, especially when it comes to my \"higher for longer\" thesis, which I have maintained since the end of the 2020 pandemic lockdowns. While I<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> won’t recycle the entire thing, it was basically based on a few key pillars:</span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Globalization became deglobalization</strong>, which was pushed by both Democrats and Republicans in the United States. This includes Trump’s first round of tariffs in 2017-2021, President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and the current tariffs from President Trump’s second term. Needless to say, there’s more, as both parties know that America has an opportunity to rebuild its industrial base and a duty to de-risk supply chains. The pandemic was a wake-up call. Given how serious new trends like AI and robotics are, supply chain resilience is absolutely critical. Rebuilding supply chains and fewer low-cost products from overseas are inflationary.</li> <li> <strong>The shale revolution ended</strong>. While both oil and gas production are still rising, the 2009-2021 growth rates are gone, as most basins in the United States have matured, and drillers are running out of Tier 1 reserves. Dirt-cheap natural gas and oil were a major deflationary factor before 2021.</li> <li> <strong>Both labor and material availability</strong> were much better before the pandemic.</li> <li> <strong>The benefits of the Internet</strong> went into overdrive, as software took over and most companies could suddenly become very asset-light. This was deflationary.</li> <li> <strong>Artificial intelligence is super energy-intensive</strong>. While I believe AI will eventually turn into a major deflationary factor after 4-5 years due to its impact on process efficiencies (this is super bad for labor), it is currently creating massive bottlenecks in power and infrastructure markets. This is very inflationary.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this context, the chart below (1-year forward inflation expectations) shows exactly what I mean. Before the Great Financial Crisis, 2% inflation may have been a goal, but it certainly hasn’t been achieved. Then, between the Great Financial Crisis and 2021, inflation was so low that the Fed actually struggled to raise it to 2%, which provided a lot of liquidity from various QE programs, including from other banks like the European Central Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, inflation has clearly entered a new regime, as 3% seems to be the new normal.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1320\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make matters worse, the economy is split into two camps, consisting of the part that benefits from secular growth, like AI, and the group that focuses on the more \"normal\" aspects of the real economy. These cyclical and consumer companies have not been doing so well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why I have increasingly covered another very important aspect, which is my conviction that the Fed, with support from the government, will \"run it hot.\" If I had to summarize this thesis in just one sentence, it would be something like, \"Because of major challenges in cyclical areas, AI-related labor weakness, and a stuck housing market, the Fed and government will likely accept higher inflation to boost nominal growth, also benefiting the real debt load of the government along the way.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A few days ago, on October 26, I wrote an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833317-the-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-could-be-our-biggest-opportunity\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833317-the-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-could-be-our-biggest-opportunity\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> titled <em>\"The Fed’s Most Dangerous Gamble Could Be Our Biggest Opportunity.\"</em> It was all about these developments, and a part of my takeaway can be read below:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>My main point is that investors should be aware of current economic shifts and what the Fed and government are doing, including the risks. Focus on inflation, high-quality assets, and the risks and opportunities of AI disruption.</em></p> <p><em>We're more than likely in a \"higher for longer\" environment of sticky inflation and institutions like the Fed that are forced to stimulate without risking runaway inflation.</em></p> <p><em>This is both important and very risky. However, it can be done if deregulations and other government policies instill confidence and boost business sentiment. While I’m not at all happy with the downside risks, which are potential stagflation, I’m very upbeat and expect it can be achieved.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, last month, I wrote a similar <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824421-why-im-positioning-my-portfolio-for-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-yet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824421-why-im-positioning-my-portfolio-for-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-yet\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> where I highlighted the words of my close friend and hedge fund advisor, Albert Marko:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>[...] the Trump administration appears to be embracing that reality with a high-stakes gamble, as it is likely to target (or accept) 4% inflation and high single-digit nominal GDP growth.</em></p> <p><em>While I may sound a bit dramatic, I believe this is a full-blown paradigm shift, one that could—and likely will—renew markets for years.</em></p> <p><em>For investors, this means adapting to a world where cyclical stocks, hard assets, and value will likely outperform growth. - Albert Marko</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, my view has been that 3-4% is the new normal, which makes being prepared for higher inflation even more important, as even slight increases in inflation over time have a devastating effect on our purchasing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see below, 2% inflation over 20 years requires us to grow our wealth by roughly 50% to break even. A 4% inflation rate requires us to 1.2x our capital to achieve the same result.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1310\" data-height=\"1076\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"526\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Calculator.net (Inflation Calculator)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I’m bringing all of this up is that my call is getting confirmation, which is another way of saying that Wall Street may get used to the idea that we may have to adjust our inflation expectations and potentially move some money around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That creates opportunities.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Get Used to 3% and a Totally Different Macro Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Getting Used to 3% Inflation\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the title of a Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/inflation-3-percent-consumer-prices-washington-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-4829ae34\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/inflation-3-percent-consumer-prices-washington-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-4829ae34\" target=\"_blank\">opinion piece</a> that was published on October 24.

I’m not saying that to be political, but because it is an inflationary force.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I really like the last paragraph, which confirms my own thesis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Meanwhile, for all the controversy over Mr. Trump’s attempts to meddle with the Fed, he and Mr. Powell both seem to want lower interest rates. It makes us wonder if 3% is Washington’s new de facto inflation target. [...]. - WSJ</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reiterate, this isn’t a political article. I am not saying Powell or Trump want higher inflation to hurt anyone. I have always made the case that they will accept higher inflation to boost nominal growth and broaden general economic growth, including getting the housing market unstuck, boosting cyclical growth, and lowering the real (post-inflation) value of the national debt. If they are successful, the net effect on the U.S. economy could even be good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The downside is that they let inflation run hot and fail to grow the economy. One doesn’t need a fancy degree in economics (I certainly don’t have one) to know that the consequences of that could be very bad.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, my thesis (using my \"Fed Gamble\" article) and this article have a few things in common:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>We agree that the Fed and government accept higher inflation.</li> <li>We agree that this is a dangerous endeavour.</li> <li>We both note that higher liquidity is inflationary.</li> <li>We both note that tariffs are a hidden inflationary factor (albeit short-term and somewhat muted).</li> <li>We both believe that the average household underestimates these factors.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, obviously, there’s more evidence. Reuters, for example, wrote a great <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-cementing-higher-inflation-regime-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-cementing-higher-inflation-regime-2025-10-22/\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> titled <em>\"U.S. cementing higher inflation regime.\"</em> It was published on October 22. Here’s a part I really liked:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>Indeed, Fed board member Chris Waller - tipped by some to be the next Fed chair - opined last week that inflation is basically at target, and even floated the idea that an inflation range, rather than a point target should now be considered.</em></p> <p><em>With most of the Fed's top brass now focused on the labour market, it appears that many policymakers aren't overly concerned about inflation that is within a point or so of 2%. - Reuters</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments matter so much because it’s all a slow but steady shift in the narrative. First, the Fed failed to get inflation to 2%. Now, voices get louder so that we may not see 2% at all, as a new target range may be more appropriate. As I don’t expect the Fed to ever come out and publicly announce that they are fine with higher inflation (can you imagine?), I think they will communicate a wider target and shift the focus to protecting economic stability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the potential impact of AI on the labor market could be a great opportunity to ease. Purely theoretically, if I wanted to boost liquidity, I would use that as a reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why there is much more evidence out there than what I have shown you so far. Here’s what Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack said when she made the case that inflation is likely to stay above target until at least 2028:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>Speaking in an interview with CNBC from Frankfurt, the policymaker observed that the central bank has missed its 2% goal for more than 4 1/2 years, and is likely to keep doing so for some time.</em></p> <p><em>“I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation, both in the headline, in the core, and particularly where I’m worried about it is, I’m seeing it in services,” Hammack said. “My forecast is that we’re going to remain above target for probably the next one to two years, and not really getting back down to our objective of 2% until the end of 2027 or early 2028.” - <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/fed-s-hammack-is-still-worried-about-outlook-for-us-inflation\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/fed-s-hammack-is-still-worried-about-outlook-for-us-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The toughest part is that the Fed is losing control over key indicators like employment. While it uses weak employment as an official reason to ease financial conditions, it seems that AI is entirely in charge of employment. For that, we can use the JOLTS data in the chart below. As we can see, layoffs aren’t accelerating, yet new hires have come to a halt.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"947\" data-height=\"727\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"491\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Wells Fargo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is also one of the reasons why many people in the comment sections of my articles bring up the fear that further AI disruption could eventually derail the economy. To that, I have to say that I sadly agree. I truly think AI is going to create havoc. However, it doesn’t mean the market is toast, as the S&amp;P 500 isn’t necessarily the economy. Until AI benefits the valuations of the hyperscalers and creates a trickle-down effect from the data center boom, a lot of employment weakness will likely be offset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also believe that potential further employment deterioration will put even more pressure on the president and the Fed to ease rates, especially as we head into the midterm elections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is bullish for liquidity, bullish for bonds, and bullish for (cyclical) stocks, if you ask me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The obvious question is how long it will last. Personally, I think it could create a real bubble over the next few years, but that’s for a different article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What matters now is that we are prepared for a \"higher for longer\" environment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What to Own?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For most of my regular readers, this part won’t come with many surprises, as I have spent countless articles on inflation preparation. And, as I am a long-term investor, I don’t change my mind on what I consider to be the best investments very often.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That doesn’t mean I won’t give you new data that you can use to potentially improve your portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a perfect opportunity to dive deeper into what makes for a great investment when inflation is expected to remain high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let me show you three important things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Point one is that commodities are a great way to protect a portfolio against inflation. Using Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/which-commodities-are-the-best-hedge-for-inflation\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/which-commodities-are-the-best-hedge-for-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">data</a>, we see that inflation surprises tend to be bad for bonds (assuming no Fed interference) and equities in general.

And our research suggests that this long-term return potential comes with a bonus: attractive performance in an inflationary world. - <a href=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/equity-income-the-dividend-defense-against-inflation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/equity-income-the-dividend-defense-against-inflation.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span></span></a></em><em>AllianceBernstein</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me to point three. If we combine the first two points, we get a strong tailwind for (higher-yielding) dividend stocks in the energy space, which is a thesis supported by Hartford Funds' findings that show energy stocks have, by far, the highest probability to beat inflation and the highest outperformance among equities, as we can see below.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1204\" data-height=\"764\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"406\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hartford Funds</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This explains why I like energy stocks so much. Especially the higher-yielding ones like Diamondback Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FANG\" title=\"Diamondback Energy, Inc.\">FANG</a>), Canadian Natural Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNQ\" title=\"Canadian Natural Resources Limited\">CNQ</a>), which I own, Viper Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNOM\" title=\"Viper Energy, Inc.\">VNOM</a>), which is a variable/special dividend royalty play in the Permian Basin, and the big ones like Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>), which may be boring but are great income stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t an energy article. In general, companies with pricing power are a great way to be protected. This even includes boring REITs that often have fixed annual rent escalators somewhere close to 2%. Even if inflation runs hot, they will eventually benefit from it through mark-to-market adjustments during rent renewals. That’s why they have the second-highest probability of beating inflation, according to the same Hartford data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, all transportation companies I own use fuel surcharges to offset energy inflation, while retailers like Home Depot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HD\" title=\"The Home Depot, Inc.\">HD</a>) regularly adjust their prices. In other words, while many companies may not benefit from inflation, many adjust. The most straightforward example is Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), which sells to consumers who are, in general, not in a good spot to take on higher inflation. As long as Walmart keeps its gross margins aligned, it should be fine over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, for investors like you and me, it’s not about turning our entire portfolios into trading vehicles. We should stick to the core, which is (for most readers) conservative long-term investing. However, we may have to make a few small adjustments, which can include buying some inflation beneficiaries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The best argument for that is the chart below, which I used in an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680341-that-one-chart-i-cannot-stop-thinking-about\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680341-that-one-chart-i-cannot-stop-thinking-about\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> last year. While stocks (S&amp;P 500), in general, are good long-term investments, we have seen many decades where inflation offset gains, causing investors to see their wealth go sideways for sometimes an entire generation.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1816\" data-height=\"966\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Multpl</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s also why I will keep showing you my favorite actionable ideas in the days, weeks, quarters, and likely even years that lie ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this is my takeaway:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’re now at the point I hoped we could avoid, which is that my \"higher for longer\" thesis is slowly but steadily going mainstream. After a fantastic post-Great Financial Crisis decade, people are starting to realize the underlying fundamentals have shifted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2% goal now seems to be a \"bridge too far,\" to use the title of a famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bridge_Too_Far_%28film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bridge_Too_Far_%28film%29\" target=\"_blank\">WW2 movie</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe 3-4% inflation will be the new normal, which is supported by new developments that all hint at plans to \"run it hot,\" which is an experiment I will continue to spend a lot of time on going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It also means we may have to make some portfolio adjustments, as the mix of the market’s lofty valuation and inflation risk poses a serious threat to our ability to generate value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why I am increasingly focused on energy, high-quality dividend stocks, and other companies with substantial pricing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, it’s not about being right but about being prepared, as especially younger people could run into much bigger problems when it comes to building wealth than the generations who enjoyed the bull market of the past two decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, eventually, I think the impact of AI will be very deflationary. However, until we are dealing with inflationary power and infrastructure bottlenecks, I think that’s at least 5 years away.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, stay tuned for more!</p>",

The company has shown much better cost control in Q2 and now in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, the company was forced to revise down the annual gold production guidance from 580-630Koz to 560-580Koz now in Q3. This is due to a few assets underperforming in the year, with some downtime at Magino and Island Gold most recently. So, even if Q3 is an improvement to Q2, which was in turn much better than Q1, and Q4 will be substantially better than Q3. The improvements haven't been fast enough to offset the weakness at the beginning of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A positive recent development was that Alamos Gold has <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/15/3149643/0/en/Alamos-Gold-Announces-the-Sale-of-its-Turkish-Development-Projects-for-Total-Cash-Consideration-of-470-million.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> the sale of its idle Turkish assets for $470M, where $160M will be paid at the closing of the deal and the remaining sums within two years.

Adjusted EBITDA was $284M, up 9% compared to Q2 2025. The company also reported a record free cash flow of $130M, despite aggressively investing in growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presently, there are three projects in construction, which are funded by operating cash flow. The fact that Alamos Gold is still generating record free cash flow is very impressive and the strong gold price has no doubt helped. I would note that Lynn Lake is now somewhat delayed due to wildfires and production is not expected to begin until 2029. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 3 - Source: Alamos Gold Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"234\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 3 - Source: Alamos Gold Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company reported a gold production of 141,700 gold ounces in Q3, up 3% compared to Q2. The gold sales were slightly lower than production at 136,473 ounces, which might have put some upward pressure on unit costs. The realized gold price of $3,359/oz was also a record in the most recent quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold increased its cost guidance earlier this year due to the higher gold price and the underperformance of Magino and Young-Davidson. The cash cost was $973/oz and the all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") was $1,375/oz in Q3. These were 9% and 7% declines compared to Q2 and well below what we saw in the higher-cost Q1 quarter. The Q3 cost figures are at the low end of the revised annual cost guidance ranges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combination of a very strong gold price and good cost control led to a record AISC margin of $1,984/oz in Q3, even though the company sold 12,346 ounces into the gold prepayment facility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1036\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 4 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 4 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"933\" data-height=\"507\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 5 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 5 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold reported a slight decrease in production quarter-over-quarter for Young-Davidson, while the Island Gold District saw production increase by 4% and the Mulatos District production increased as much as 9% quarter-over-quarter.

The liquidity from the Turkish asset sale has further strengthened the balance sheet after that deal closed in early Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold pays a quarterly dividend of $0.025, which equates to a dividend yield of 0.3%. With a growing cash balance, despite its growth investments, the company opened up for utilizing its buybacks in the Q3 result. There is likely plenty of room for buybacks if the strong gold price environment persists.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>the Company expects to reduce existing debt obligations, and will assess opportunities to be active on its share buyback</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a lot to like about Alamos Gold. This is a quality producer, with most of its assets in Canada, and the growth profile is very attractive. The phase 3+ project at Island Gold is set to come online in the second half of 2026, which will both increase production out of Island Gold and lower the operating cost of that asset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The phase 3+ project accounts for all the expected production growth in 2026 and 2027 for the company. Given that Island Gold is already today the lowest cost mine for Alamos, growing that production and decreasing the mine-site cost will lead to substantially lower consolidated costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Later this decade, we have Lynn Lake and likely also another growth project at Island Gold to take the annual gold production above 1Moz, which will be transformational for Alamos Gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"984\" data-height=\"595\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports &amp; Press Releases\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 8 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports &amp; Press Releases</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gold price has averaged around $3,300/oz in 2025 and if we use that to estimate the cash flow over the coming years, the cash flow projections look something like the chart below.

However, if we only use sustaining capex, the free cash flow yield is 7-8% over the coming year, which is in my view a very attractive valuation for this quality gold mining company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The max drawdown for Alamos has been 23% over the last 3 years and we also consider that the stock has lagged the GDX this year, I think the current 15-20% drawdown is an attractive buying opportunity. We would likely need to see a more pronounced gold price decline or operations to stumble substantially for Alamos Gold to see a larger 25+% drawdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, based on after hours price action yesterday, Alamos Gold might decline today, which is understandable following a downward revised production guidance. I have been increasing my exposure following the recent correction in Alamos Gold and I expect to buy more if we see further downside. I rate Alamos Gold as a buy at this level.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 10 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 10 - Source: Koyfin</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",
