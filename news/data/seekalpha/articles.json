That said, net new customer growth is slowing down, calling into question the stock’s rich valuation multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d6333ea17f4353de738d633a8b5e04a5.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d6333ea17f4353de738d633a8b5e04a5.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d6333ea17f4353de738d633a8b5e04a5.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d6333ea17f4353de738d633a8b5e04a5.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854191-warby-parker-lock-in-gains-on-the-google-spike-downgrade\">I last wrote a neutral article</a> on Warby Parker in December, when the stock was trading at $27 per share. Even though the stock is down ~10% since then, I’m not convinced enough that there’s a compelling enough growth story here to justify a market-topping adjusted EBITDA multiple, especially when gross margins are sliding downward. Amid the emergence of many better small- and mid-cap value plays in the tech sector, Warby Parker’s luster is vastly diminished, and I’m dropping my rating on the stock to <strong>sell.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don’t get me wrong: I don’t necessarily think Warby Parker is a bad business, but I do think it’s mispriced in today’s market. Since valuation is my primary gripe against this stock, let’s open the discussion with a look at the company’s latest guidance and how current valuation multiples stack up against it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices near $25, Warby Parker trades at a market cap of $3.06 billion. Netting off the $286.4 million of cash (against zero debt) on the company’s latest balance sheet gives us an enterprise value of $2.77 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1314\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker outlook <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown in the chart above, for FY26 the company is guiding to 10-12% y/y revenue growth and $117-$119 million in adjusted EBITDA (+23% y/y) that reflects a 12.2% midpoint margin, up slightly from 10.9% in FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This positions Warby Parker's valuation at a sharp 23.5x EV/FY26 multiple. I don't see the appeal in paying a market-topping EBITDA multiple when top line growth is slowing to the low double digits, with customer growth slowing to the single digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We note there is \"upside risk\" from two factors: success in AI glasses and a potential removal of tariffs, which is a major wild card still up in the air. We should remind ourselves, however, that Warby Parker's tech partner here is Google, which <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052115/how-why-google-glass-failed.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">failed to get Google Glass</a> off the ground in 2013. Meanwhile, many competitors are rushing in, including Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) (whose partnership with Ray Ban arguably leverages a better-known consumer brand than Warby Parker).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sell the earning spike here and invest elsewhere.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Download</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now go through Warby Parker's latest quarterly results in greater detail.

Revenue growth decelerated two points versus 15% y/y growth in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has made us worried about some of the recent customer trends that the company is experiencing. As shown below, Warby Parker’s count of active customers (defined as those who have made a purchase within the last twelve months) grew by only 30k in Q4, with y/y growth slowing to 7% (from 9.3% in Q3). We note as well that this is atypical seasonality for Warby Parker and for most DTC brands, as Q4 contains the core holiday period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2346\" data-height=\"1272\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker Q4 key trended metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker Q4 key trended metrics <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management attributed a portion of the slowdown to macro factors and noted that prescription glasses units sold declined -6% y/y. Per CEO David Bilboa’s remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876013-warby-parker-inc-wrby-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>In fiscal 2025, we delivered 13% revenue growth, driven by 47 new store openings, the most ever in a single year, high single-digit customer growth and mid-single-digit average revenue per customer growth. We believe this performance reflects continued market share gains. We drove healthy unit volumes, average selling price and customer growth, while prescription glasses units declined 6% industry-wide according to the Vision Council.</p> <p>And while much of the category relied on significant price increases, we mitigated the impact of tariffs while preserving our unmatched value proposition and maintaining prices on the vast majority of our offerings, including our $95 prescription glasses.”</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we do note to Warby Parker’s credit that it is attempting to appeal to higher-value customers who are more likely to purchase more holistic vision care from the company - encompassing eye exams and contact lenses on top of eyeglasses. The rising mix of these customers has driven the company’s average revenue per customer 5.7% y/y higher to $324. The company also plans to try to work deals with insurance carriers to broaden insurance eligibility, which may help to pull in more customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another major growth priority for 2026 is expansion of the company’s retail store network, which is the principal lever for Warby Parker to improve consumer brand recognition. The company ended FY25 with 323 retail stores, opening 47 new stores within the year. It plans to step up new store openings to 50 in FY26, marking 15% net location expansion for next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2360\" data-height=\"1284\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker retail expansion\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker retail expansion <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, Warby Parker’s gross margins declined -170bps y/y to 52.4%, owing to tariffs. That said, the company did manage to offset this headwind with a 340bps reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue. As a result, adjusted EBITDA rose 10% y/y to $15.2 million, with margins holding roughly flat y/y at 7.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722681360535936_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1834\" data-height=\"622\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722681360535936_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"217\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722681360535936_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722681360535936_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722681360535936_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722681360535936_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker adjusted EBITDA <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaways</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Warby Parker continues to post decent results amid what the company believes is a declining eyeglass industry, I find its &gt;20x adjusted EBITDA multiple too rich in a market where bargains are plenty. Don’t count on AI smart glasses to provide a huge burst in revenue, either, as this is still an unproven concept at this stage that hasn’t gained broad consumer acceptance. Take advantage of the post-earnings upside to sell.</p>",

The gains come<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as NECB has made some progress on attracting new deposits in H2 2025, although more work remains on this front.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Fed rate cuts and deposit pressure have resulted in a small contraction in NECB's net interest margin, I believe the shares offer further upside for the remainder of 2026, confirming my previous Buy rating on the company. My positive outlook is underpinned by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A very undemanding 7.45x trailing P/E multiple representing a circa 40% discount to regional bank peers.</li> <li>Solid capital position and a valuation below book value, making incremental share repurchases highly accretive.</li> <li>Supreme credit quality, notwithstanding risks from a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in New York.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers not familiar with NECB may find the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829420-northeast-community-bancorp-low-earnings-multiple-makes-up-for-deposit-pressures\"><em>Company Overview</em> section in my previous article</a> insightful. The only change I would highlight is that following H2 2025 deposit inflows, the loan-to-deposit ratio has shrunk to 1.15x, still elevated relative to peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 2025 Results Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20379931-northeast-community-bancorp-inc-reports-results-for-the-quarter-and-year-ended-december-31#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">reported</a> EPS of $0.79/share, a 5.3% Y/Y jump relative to the prior year quarter. The increase was principally driven by loan growth at 2.6% Y/Y, while credit quality remained supreme (0% nonperforming loans).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company made notable progress on attracting new deposits, which were up 9.3% relative to H1 2025. Still, compared to the end of 2024, total deposits were still down by about 3.2%. Against the backdrop of a growing loan portfolio, NECB clearly needs to continue to put an emphasis on deposit inflows during 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB navigated recent Fed rate cuts quite well, with the net interest margin standing at 5.18%, only 0.11% below the 5.29% achieved in Q4 2024. I would expect some incremental decline in net interest margins in 2026 as the Fed continues with Fed rate cuts, while NECB strives to further reduce its loan-to-deposit ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Book value stood at $25.67/share at the end of 2025, a circa 10% Y/Y increase, which is quite impressive when you consider that NECB also paid a total of $0.80/share in four quarterly dividend payments. The bank<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20332376-northeast-community-bancorp-inc-announces-third-stock-repurchase-program#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\"> recently authorized a third buyback program</a>, although the start has apparently been quite slow, with shares outstanding up 1.1% Y/Y in Q4 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, I believe NECB reported a solid set of financial results, notwithstanding the need to make further progress on deposit outflows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Backdrop</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB operates exclusively in New York and Massachusetts. As such, any potential deterioration in credit quality may be precipitated by a worsening macroeconomic environment in these two states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">New York has seen a notable <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ny.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">increase in the unemployment rate to 4.6% at the end of 2025</a>, some 0.6% higher compared with July 2025. As such, I believe provisioning could pick up in 2026 should current trends persist.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As far as Massachusetts is concerned, the macroeconomic picture there is somewhat more stable, with <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ma.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.8% in recent months</a>. Even so, both states exhibit an unemployment rate above the national average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To sum up, with the caveat that unemployment data may improve alongside an expected pickup in U.S. economic growth in 2026, current macro indicators suggest some deterioration in credit quality for NECB this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Rating</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after the strong start to 2026, NECB shares still trade at a circa 6% book value discount, indicating persistent investor worries about H1 2025 deposit outflows. For comparison, regional bank peers held in the iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAT\" title=\"iShares US Regional Banks ETF\">IAT</a>) at <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239521/ishares-us-regional-banks-etf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">roughly 1.27x their book value</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good news is that with NECB's robust CET1 capital ratio of 15.36%, the company can take advantage of the persistent book value discount via share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to profitability, NECB also scores well compared to regional bank peers. The bank generated $3.25/share in 2025 earnings, indicating a trailing P/E of 7.45x. Regional bank peers held in IAT trade at a much higher valuation of roughly 12.32x their trailing earnings. In essence, on a trailing P/E basis, NECB offers a discount of around 40% relative to its direct peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB only has one analyst estimate for 2026-2027 earnings, with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NECB/earnings\">2026 EPS seen at $3.39/share</a>, representing a growth rate of only 4.3% relative to 2025. I would view this estimate as conservative in light of NECB's low dividend payout ratio of only 0.25x, indicating that many of the above-mentioned headwinds stemming from deposit pressures and a deteriorating macro environment are likely priced in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, notwithstanding risks that I will discuss in the next section, I anticipate NECB to continue to outperform regional bank peers, confirming my previous Buy rating on the shares.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As things stand, NECB boasts supreme credit quality and a healthy CET1 capital ratio. As such, risks in the immediate term look quite benign. That said, a potential further deterioration in New York/Massachusetts macroeconomic conditions may ultimately result in a rise in loan delinquencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">72% of NECB's loan portfolio is concentrated in construction loans, with a further 18% allocation to residential real estate financing. While incremental Fed rate cuts create a favorable backdrop for the real estate sector in general, NECB's loan concentration will likely result in highly cyclical earnings, as opposed to regional bank peers, which typically exhibit greater diversification (although I should note that outsized real estate exposure is not that uncommon among the sector).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, while NECB has made progress on attracting deposits in H2 2025, the company's wide discount relative to regional bank peers shows persistent worries about NECB's competitive position in the deposit market. In essence, failure to attract deposits at attractive terms may result in a further decline in NECB's net interest margin.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The broader U.S. financials sector has struggled to post gains so far in 2026, impacted by a decline in long-term risk-free interest rates, which will likely put pressure on net interest income. Jitters around private credit markets have also likely weighed on returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, NECB shares have posted modest gains, with the bank reporting overall solid Q4 2025 results and making progress on attracting new deposits, although more work remains to be done on this front in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB stock trades at a wide discount to regional bank peers, indicating that risks related to a potential rise in non-performing loans and/or a further contraction in the net interest margin are already priced into the shares. As such, I see room for further NECB outperformance relative to U.S. financial peers, confirming my previous Buy rating on the shares.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

The credit quality is primarily BB and below, but there is a small slice of investment-grade exposure here as well. Given some relatively longer average life of the underlying portfolio and the small slice of investment-grade exposure, that does make the fund's effective duration a bit higher relative to its high-yield-focused peers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has seen its discount widen since our prior update, which makes it a bit more attractive to consider today. However, it is still trading near its longer-term average. In fact, there was a period of time when a double-digit discount wasn't all that uncommon, though that was a handful of years ago. The fund, maintaining its monthly distribution that is working out to over 13%, is likely keeping investors interested. While coverage of the distribution leads to sustainability questions, I suspect they won't be too quick to cut this payout to investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that, I believe that EHI remains a hold today based on wanting to see a deeper discount level before considering it appealing enough to jump in. If that came with the impact of an overall market downturn, that would help to make it that much more interesting as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EHI Basics</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: -0.27</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -4.63%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 13.15%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.49%</li> <li>Leverage: 29.24%</li> <li>Managed Assets: $288.57 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EHI's<a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/closed-end-funds/products/90293/SINGLCLASS/western-asset-global-high-income-fund-inc/EHI#geographic-breakdown\" rel=\"nofollow\"> investment objective</a> is to seek \"high current income, with a secondary objective of total return.\" To achieve that, the fund will \"provide a global, leveraged portfolio of investment grade, below investment grade, and emerging market fixed-income securities.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the fund is leveraged, that increases volatility and risk for investing in the fund. The other side of this is that it can also help to drive performance higher when things are going well. However, it also comes with a cost. When including those interest expenses, the fund's total expense ratio comes in at 4.14%</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance - Distribution Likely Drives Increased Interest</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4814592-ehi-discount-remains-narrow-as-fund-shifts-toward-lower-quality-holdings\">our last update</a>, the fund has provided positive total returns, though its price has declined somewhat since then. So the returns here were driven entirely by the distribution being paid out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721984652376611.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Performance Since Prior Update\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"257\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721984652376611.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Performance Since Prior Update <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the fund's discount also widened a touch during this period, that would have added further negative pressure to the actual share price relative to the fund's underlying NAV returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, relative to the longer term, the fund still isn't looking like a bargain. Over the last five years, the fund's average discount has come in around 4.5%—about right where we are now. In looking back over the last decade, we can see the period where a 10%+ discount was quite normal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_90812ec5098fc40bc5cee86d56704a47.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_90812ec5098fc40bc5cee86d56704a47.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_90812ec5098fc40bc5cee86d56704a47.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_90812ec5098fc40bc5cee86d56704a47.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During that widening discount period, it was when the fund had made a number of cuts in its payout. Since then, EHI has maintained its distribution for quite a number of years now, and the last move was to even increase it in early 2024. That tends to attract income-focused investors—particularly, those that also find higher yields enticing because the current distribution works out to 13.15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the NAV rate, that works out to a hefty 12.54%. That's quite an elevated level and would call into question some sustainability issues over the longer term. Remember, a CEF can essentially pay whatever it would like as long as the NAV remains above $0.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With EHI, they were able to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241009829828/en/Western-Asset-Global-High-Income-Fund-Inc.-Announces-Preliminary-Results-of-Transferable-Rights-Offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">conduct a rights offering</a> in 2024. It was dilutive to the NAV, as most ROs are, as they are done at a discount to the NAV per share at the time. Still, one of the reasons they were able to pull off an RO is because the fund was flirting around a premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They likely understand that any distribution cut would send the discount widening out quite materially. Therefore, despite the elevated level, I suspect they are quite content with keeping the payout right where it is in the hopes of eventually being able to pull the RO trigger once again. While it hits the NAV per share due to the dilution, the overall assets being managed increase nonetheless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last <a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/tools-and-resources/lit-preview/90293/SINGLCLASS/western-asset-global-high-income-fund-inc#semiannual-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">semi-annual report</a> for the period ended November 30, 2025, showed that net investment income coverage came in at around 64%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Financial Highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Financial Highlights <span>(Western Asset)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For most fixed-income CEFs, we'd ideally like to see this over 100%. However, this isn't all that common anymore these days as CEFs attempt to keep discounts narrow by paying out relatively higher distributions. That said, the current distribution coverage from EHI is quite low, even relative to some of its high-yield peers. Of course, this is what we would expect when we see a distribution rate that is pushing over 12% on a NAV basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EHI's Portfolio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of peers, over the longer term, the fund has underperformed most of its peers listed on CEFData.

Overall, EHI is only holding around 59% of its portfolio in U.S. debt, with the remainder elsewhere around the globe.

When comparing that to EMB, the effective duration comes in at 6.82 years, and HYG shows its portfolio with an effective duration of 2.75 years. Thus, we can presume that some of the longer duration is coming in from the emerging market government debt that EHI carries, making it relatively more interest rate sensitive with its longer maturity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a fund that leans heavily into below-investment-grade credit, they do have the common key feature to fight back against the risks that can pose—which is a significant number of holdings at 404 for the fund. This is then carried out through no individual position carrying too much of an overweight allocation. After the first handful of names, the allocations don't even reach 1% of the fund's weighting anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1030\" data-height=\"490\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Top Ten Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Top Ten Holdings <span>(Western Asset)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to investing in EHI, the discount isn't quite there yet, even as it has widened a touch since our prior update. I'd personally feel more comfortable investing at an 8%+ discount level, and if that occurs during increased market volatility when high-yield spreads widen, that would be even more ideal. One of the key features of EHI is that it pays a relatively higher distribution rate while also providing a bit of exposure to emerging market debt. Unfortunately, that distribution coverage is rather weak, but I also don't suspect they have intentions of cutting it anytime soon. I think the main goal would be to get the fund to trade closer to a premium once again and then possibly initiate another rights offering.</p>",

Ship tracking sites are showing oil tankers making U-turns to avoid the strait. It is unclear if this ship, and others like it that are making similar maneuvers, are leaving due to the strait's closure or for their safety to avoid crossfire during a conflict. Many tankers may have insurance carriers that demanded they avoid the strait as news of strikes broke out, and so they turned around even if the Iranian authorities didn't cause it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this is still in the fog of war information-wise, and so it's unclear how much further oil could go. It will depend on the depth of escalation moving forward and what is really going on with passage through the strait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w640\" alt=\"oil tanker avoids strait of hormuz\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"548\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The worse this conflict gets, the higher oil is likely to go, and I expect that to hold true until there is some resolution about the strait. That doesn't mean that there has to be resolution about Iran or their government. The U.S. breaking their control of the strait and allowing transit could cause oil to come back down quickly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OPEC+ Still Has A Say</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a point to note here that the price of oil was beaten down all last year, and so even though it has jumped on this recent speculation, its absolute levels are still fairly low to recent history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the levers of the oil market is OPEC+, which Iran is part of but whose controlling members Iran just shot missiles at. Sure, the targets were American bases, but I cannot imagine that there is a single Gulf monarchy that is happy with Iran right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next meeting is March 1st, and I imagine that they will work on making sure that OPEC+ oil is allowed through the strait. Whether that is achievable or not is unclear, so for now, all we can do is speculate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps a solution is reached where Iran allows partial passage for OPEC+ tankers, but not for U.S. or EU-flagged vessels. Again, speculation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing that they will decide is their target output levels. They could hike production again to use volume to offset the price hikes. OPEC+ has been working on creating an oil glut over the last year, and while they slowed production recently, it is common for them to change direction quickly in response to events like these. This is especially poignant for the Gulf monarchies because they are responding to what is happening on their doorstep this time around, unlike with Venezuela.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks Will Shake It Off</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don't buy any oil from Iran, and the U.S. doesn't import much from the affected countries.

For the record, I do not believe we will go to war with Iran, but I do not control what narratives the market puts weight in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It behooves us to remember that markets are forward-looking. They react to today's news, but it becomes priced in quickly, and tomorrow's news quickly takes over.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A friend said it best to me when we were discussing the potential of the U.S. attacking Iran again earlier this week:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>They always do it on a Friday. That way, the markets can fall over the weekend. By Monday's open, there's been two news cycles. That's a lot of time for other stories to take over.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And history shows us the truth in this.

Gold has been particularly responsive to geopolitical tensions since 2022, replacing the role of the U.S. dollar as the ultimate safe haven from chaos.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imagine telling an investor in the 00s that traders would run to treasury duration to avoid geopolitical risk. <em>They worry about what sovereigns are doing, so they buy sovereign debt? </em>Mind-blowing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not the part about gold, though—that checks out for most people. Geopolitical risk invites investors to load up on an asset that sovereigns don't outright control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"gold response to geopolitical events\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"994\" height=\"481\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>World Gold Council</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through last year, geopolitical risk was a strong driver for gold's returns. This is similar to oil, and so similar risks should be considered—a conclusion of the tensions could mean a sell-off is in store. Gold in particular is in a much more precarious position than oil since its producers are not putting it in a glut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can see just how much of a drag momentum has been, and I expect it to continue to be, as long-term holders realize their gains after the best year for gold in decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"drivers of gold returns\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"987\" height=\"470\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>World Gold Council</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want to know more about my gold convictions, take a look at my most recent gold-focused article, “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4859734-gold-isnt-near-a-peak\">Gold Isn't Near a Peak.</a>” It's crazy to think that the article was written just a month ago, and gold is up ~15% since.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, the jury is still out on how things will unfold in Iran. The U.S. has not given any signals if more attacks are imminent, and it's unclear if or for how long Iran intends to try to close the Strait of Hormuz. That will be a determining factor for how markets react.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil is bid up on speculation, and a full closure, which would likely include direct U.S. intervention in the area, could cause oil to spike. Beware if you are trading oil or oil-related ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't expect too much pain to bleed over into the U.S. economy even if oil is stopped, as we do not import much from the Persian Gulf. The stock market may react negatively at first, but time will heal things, as other news cycles will begin to factor in. This conflict does not stop the next earnings call from happening, and so, for now, I am not worried about much movement in indexes, although individual firms with exposure to the conflict area are another story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold is the key winner of rising geopolitical tensions in our current market, and I expect precious metals across the board to benefit regardless of the outcome in Iran.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crises and conflicts like this are a good reminder that position sizing is more important than security selection. It is very difficult to time these events and to trade them, so ensuring that your risk exposure is appropriate is critical for your portfolio when bombs start flying—and they <em>are </em>flying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I hope for peace.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",

Based on<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-full-statement-on-us-iran-attack-major-combat-operations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-full-statement-on-us-iran-attack-major-combat-operations/\" target=\"_blank\"> President Trump's statement,</a> the mission of Operation Epic Fury seems to be regime change in Iran.</p> <p>The initial attacks<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> were on the offices of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the locations of other key Iranian political and military leaders.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran immediately retaliated by launching strikes on US military bases in the region and Israel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span class=\"highlighted_text\"></span></p> <h3 data-path-to-node=\"4\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h3> <p data-path-to-node=\"3,0\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><b data-path-to-node=\"3,0\" data-index-in-node=\"0\">Note:</b> I’m mindful of the heavy human and political weight of current events, but for the purpose of this piece, I’m keeping the focus strictly on the market and economic impacts.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The immediate justification for Operation Fury is related to Iran's nuclear program. A nuclear Iran is an existential threat to Israel, and President Trump was clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. The negotiations leading to the attack failed, as Iran refused to abandon its nuclear ambitions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there is also a big-picture macro view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, we are in the process of global fragmentation and polarization, with the unfolding collapse of the post-WWII world order. The main blocks are emerging, the US-led block and the China-led block, with a possibility of a third EU-led block.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The China-led bloc includes Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Venezuela was part of this block until the Maduro capture. It seems like Iran is next to collapse - and for this, it's important to have the regime change in Iran where the new regime must be US-friendly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current process of polarization is complicated by the fact that China has a global monopoly on rare earths, which are crucial for advanced tech and military purposes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, China imports 70-75% of the energy it consumes, and Iran is one of the top energy suppliers to China. China also imported oil from Venezuela. Thus, by controlling the oil supplies from Iran and Venezuela, the US is gaining leverage over China on energy security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is all happening in advance of Trump's visit to China at the end of March. Trump and Xi will likely discuss the extension of the temporary truce on rare materials export ban, which is set to expire in November.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What happens next in Iran?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operation Epic Fury is very risky. The plan assumes that the regime change can be done by the Iranian people and that the Iranian security forces will surrender.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US-Israeli strikes at this time have a mission of regime change led by a rebellion from within. At this point we don't have any information about internal rebellion against the leadership from the general population or the security forces. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point, Operation Epic Fury is not targeting the Iranian nuclear infrastructure or energy infrastructure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How will Iran respond?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point Iran is retaliating by striking US military bases in the area and Israel, and it's not targeting the regional energy infrastructure, and it's not targeting energy flows through the Strait of Hormuz.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During this early phase of the war, Iran is likely primarily concerned about the safety of its leaders and ensuring regime succession in case the key figures are terminated. In addition, the regime is likely monitoring the internal situation to ensure that there is no internal rebellion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phase Two could be more brutal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, that's the current situation - if the Phase One accomplishes regime change in Iran, one way or another, the operation ends. The Phase One could last a few weeks, with the targeted end before Trump visits China in late March.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Phase One is unsuccessful in regime change, Phase Two could be more brutal. For the US, there is no turning back anymore; the war has started.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phase Two might involve strikes on Iranian energy infrastructure and could even involve some \"boots on the ground.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran is likely to retaliate by also targeting US economic interests, striking regional energy infrastructure, and attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz. The Iranian regime in this situation could become more desperate and thus more dangerous.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, the US will prevail. However, Phase Three could involve other countries and regions. How will China respond? How will Russia respond? The longer this war lasts, the more dangerous it becomes for global stability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Impact on the financial markets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phase One of Operation Epic Fury is mostly benign for the financial markets. Neither side is currently targeting the regional energy infrastructure, and the flow of oil continues through the Strait of Hormuz.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial markets are strictly concerned about the price of oil and the implications of inflationary expectations and, thus, the central bank policy. At this point, it seems like the US wants to avoid the oil price spike, given the affordability issues leading into the midterm elections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The immediate effect will likely be Flight to Safety (based on current information):</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The US Dollar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY\" title=\"US Dollar Index\">DXY</a>) is likely to rise.</li> <li>Treasury Bonds are likely to rise with the 10Y yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" target=\"_blank\">US10Y</a>) falling towards 3.75%.</li> <li>Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>) could also rise, although the price of Gold already reflects the worst scenario.</li> <li>Oil (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USO\" title=\"United States Oil Fund LP ETF\">USO</a></span>) price to stay elevated, likely around $70, but the spike is not likely in this phase.</li> <li>The stock market (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" target=\"_blank\">SP500</a>) could open lower, but the bounce is likely; in fact, lower interest rates could be positive for the stock market, and this could be a temporary distraction from the real issues, like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876403-its-an-early-phase-financial-crisis-the-private-credit-bust\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876403-its-an-early-phase-financial-crisis-the-private-credit-bust\" target=\"_blank\">the private credit issue</a> and the AI bubble burst.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the situation is fluid, and it could change. Specifically, we could have a quick resolution in Iran before the markets even open on Monday, and that could cause a huge relief rally in the S&amp;P 500 as VIX (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIX\" title=\"S&amp;P VIX Index\">VIX</a>) falls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problems for the financial markets will start to emerge as the war drags on towards Phase Two - that's when the oil price spikes well above $100, causing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873066-a-us-iran-war-could-trigger-a-global-recession\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873066-a-us-iran-war-could-trigger-a-global-recession\" target=\"_blank\">a global recession</a>, with a major correction of 30-35% in the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point it is difficult to predict; the news is flowing in. At the time of writing, this news came in. There will be more clarity by Monday, but the playbook is clear.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial markets will hope that this news is correct and that Operation Epic Fury concludes quickly, which is also the hope of all civilians, as it would greatly reduce the civilian casualties on all sides.</p>",

Iran produces approximately <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/an-overview-irans-energy-industry-infrastructure-2026-02-28/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/an-overview-irans-energy-industry-infrastructure-2026-02-28/\" target=\"_blank\">3.3 million barrels</a> of oil per day despite international sanctions. It is worth noting that more than<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-heavy-reliance-iranian-oil-imports-2026-01-13/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-heavy-reliance-iranian-oil-imports-2026-01-13/\" target=\"_blank\"> 80% of exports</a> go to China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another intriguing point is location, given that the Strait of Hormuz, responsible for the passage of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78n6p09pzno\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78n6p09pzno\" target=\"_blank\">20% of global oil</a>, is between Iran and Oman.

On the other hand, assets that are expected to fall will be American and global stocks (1% to 2%) and, to a greater extent, cryptocurrencies (3% to 10%). At this moment, on decentralized exchanges, oil rose 8%, gold rose 4%, and the Nasdaq fell more than 1%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This event consolidates <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854404-uco-2026-is-the-year-of-oil-and-these-charts-prove-it-rating-upgrade\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854404-uco-2026-is-the-year-of-oil-and-these-charts-prove-it-rating-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\">my investment theses</a> in oil ETFs.

It also remains to be seen whether the strait and oil production will remain unscathed. Given the facts, let's analyze the pessimistic scenario and the optimistic <span id=\"jS$306\" class=\"j3\">scenario.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pessimistic Scenario</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The event has a remote chance of causing an energy crisis in the world, in my opinion. If this happens, the logical tendency is for oil to rise in value, and in this scenario, net oil-exporting countries can be safe havens for investments, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One example is Brazil. The country is a <a href=\"https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2026/02/06/brazils-trade-surplus-leans-more-heavily-on-oil-exports.ghtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2026/02/06/brazils-trade-surplus-leans-more-heavily-on-oil-exports.ghtml\" target=\"_blank\">net oil exporter</a>, and it is worth noting that my portfolio of recommended stocks for 2026 has a mix of American stocks and Brazilian stocks, and the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4857311-my-10-recommended-stocks-for-2026\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4857311-my-10-recommended-stocks-for-2026\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> easily beats the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optimistic Scenario</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the optimistic scenario, the Trump administration has created a scenario in which the Iranian regime is replaced by a more stable leadership led by the Iranian people. It is worth remembering that sanctions on Iran were introduced in <a href=\"https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2017/jul/31/us-sanctions-iran-2017\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2017/jul/31/us-sanctions-iran-2017\" target=\"_blank\">2017</a>, when the country was producing just over 4.1 million barrels per day, and currently production is <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/how-will-us-israeli-strikes-on-iran-affect-oil-markets/B5AIYDQWAJCPXBL2IPU4EAKKPY/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/how-will-us-israeli-strikes-on-iran-affect-oil-markets/B5AIYDQWAJCPXBL2IPU4EAKKPY/\" target=\"_blank\">3.1 million barrels</a> per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that there has been a significant reduction, and if there is greater alignment with the US and not with OPEC, the increase in production could result in a drop in oil prices in the medium term, possibly as early as the second half of this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, although the price of oil may rise in the short term, in the medium term, as supply increases, the equilibrium price could easily fall. Therefore, the outlook for the second half of 2026 would be a disinflationary effect, which would boost global stock markets.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, events of this type should not be reasons for a person to sell their investments. At these moments, it is important to remember why you purchased your assets and stick to your investment thesis. I remain convinced of all my investment theses regardless of this event.</p>",

The initial wave of this operation seems to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> have focused on taking out Iranian missile launchers and potentially some of the Iranian leadership. Obviously, this is a major geopolitical event that could trigger significant and immediate shockwaves across the financial markets. Because this operation was launched late on a Friday evening (February 27th) and escalated over Saturday, and most of the global financial markets are closed, we have not seen the visible impacts on stocks. I have seen some social media posts suggesting the stock market could be due for a sharp plunge when markets reopen; however, I see some counterpoints to this argument. With all this in mind, let's examine the potential implications for various financial assets:</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <h3 data-path-to-node=\"4\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h3> <p data-path-to-node=\"3,0\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><b data-path-to-node=\"3,0\" data-index-in-node=\"0\">Note:</b> I’m mindful of the heavy human and political weight of current events, but for the purpose of this piece, I’m keeping the focus strictly on the market side of things. The goal here is to provide a clear-eyed look at the economic impacts, independent of the broader headlines.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Initial Strike </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The initial strike's occurrence in Iran during daylight hours was surprising. This might have been due to strategic plans, as some reports suggest that Israel knew that some Iranian leadership was gathered at one location. It also occurred just shortly after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/us-iran-geneva-nuclear-talks-updates-2-26-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">negotiation talks</a> with Iran took place in Geneva. All of this might have caught Iran's regime off guard in terms of the timing of a potential attack. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tomahawk missiles, which are made by RTX Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>), appear to have been used extensively in this initial wave, and some of the other targets in Iran reportedly included the locations of the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defense, and the Presidential Institution. It is also said to have targeted senior Iranian leadership, including high-ranking political officials and military commanders. Nuclear-sensitive sites such as the Atomic Energy Organization headquarters in Tehran and military complexes and facilities in Isfahan and Qom were also targeted. Iran's missile industry near Tabriz and multiple launch sites across Iran were also targeted. The Iranian Navy and air defense systems were also struck by Operation Epic Fury.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w640\" alt=\"map\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1240\" height=\"1174\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>theguardian.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran Retaliates </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran launched retaliatory attacks using drones and missiles against Israel and U.S. bases in the Middle East. It is not surprising to see that Iran has launched an attack on Israel and sirens have been blaring in Tel Aviv; however, Israel's strong missile defenses appear to be taking down most of the incoming projectiles, and for now it seems that only very limited damage has been sustained. It's worth noting that even though Saudi Arabia did not allow the U.S. to use bases in that country for Operation Epic Fury, Iran has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/arab-states-are-choosing-sides/686195/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched attacks</a> on this and other Arab nations. This could be a major miscalculation on the part of Iran, because Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries might retaliate for this aggression. I see Iran's attacks on Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Kuwait as a sign of desperation—potentially the final acts of a regime that has little to lose because it knows its days are likely numbered.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Initial Reaction From Financial Markets </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though most financial markets were closed for the weekend, there were some hints of a risk-off reaction from Bitcoin, which initially plunged after the attacks were launched. However, Bitcoin has recovered almost all of its losses and is nearly unchanged. Futures for gold and the U.S. Dollar also were impacted initially as potential safe haven assets; however, I believe that if Iran is unable to show more of a military response, the response could be muted by the time the stock market opens next week.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">An Energy Shock? </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil prices will be a key concern. The major risk is if Iran <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-gas-majors-traders-suspend-shipments-via-hormuz-us-attacks-iran-sources-say-2026-02-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">attempts to partially or completely close</a> the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of the world's oil passes. Some analysts suggest that a sustained blockade of this key waterway could cause <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78n6p09pzno\" rel=\"nofollow\">oil prices to surge</a> towards $120 to $150 per barrel. However, it seems unlikely that Iran could close this waterway for long, if at all. Doing so would devastate its own economy because it could no longer ship oil out, thereby forfeiting a major revenue source for the Iranian regime. Many other countries, including Iranian allies like China, are said to also oppose the closure of this waterway for their own economic reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3197\" data-height=\"942\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"189\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vortexa</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kharg Island handles roughly <a href=\"https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1156475/Maritime-warning-zone-in-place-as-US-and-Israel-launch-massive-strikes-on-Iran\" rel=\"noopener\">90% of Iran's crude oil exports</a>, making this another key concern. An attack on or blockade of Kharg Island could push up oil prices. The biggest potential risks for financial markets are a surge in oil prices due to the closure of the Strait of Hormuz or damage to oil facilities on Kharg Island. There are <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/if-trump-strikes-iran-mapping-oil-disruption-scenarios#:~:text=In%20this%20scenario%2C%20air%20and,reaches%20Kharg%20via%20subsea%20pipelines\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> that the U.S. or Israel could attempt to seize control of Kharg Island to choke off Iran's primary source of oil revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk factor to consider is whether Iran attacks oil facilities in neighboring countries. This could have significant implications for oil prices and the financial markets. It also remains to be seen if Iranian allies like Hezbollah will enter this war in a major way.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock Market Implications </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major stock market indexes plunged on Friday, February 27th, due to AI disruption concerns and a hotter-than-expected <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558574-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market\">inflation report</a>. I would also add that the U.S. military buildup that occurred in the Middle East over the past several weeks made it clear that an attack on Iran could come soon, especially since the recent negotiations in Geneva concluded without any immediate solutions. This suggests that the stock market may have already priced in some type of military action, and many expected it could come this weekend since the U.S. military buildup appeared complete. The fear of an imminent attack may have also contributed to stock market losses on Friday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the oil market remains stable over this weekend because none of the worst-case scenarios, such as a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, occur, I believe the stock market could react positively to Operation Epic Fury, even though this is in contrast to some of the more fearful posts I see on social media. As shown below, the market has been stuck in a trading range; therefore, better-than-feared news regarding Iran could spark a relief rally in the coming days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's My Strategy </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran's initial response appears weak. If the regime collapses and the Iranian people take control of the government, this could be a very positive event for many financial assets. It is still early, and a lot could still happen. I believe the key for investors is if oil supplies remain stable. If this occurs, I do not expect a big negative reaction from the stock market, and instead I anticipate a potential relief rally. If oil prices surge due to attacks on Middle Eastern energy facilities or if the Strait of Hormuz is closed, the market could plunge. I would use this as a buying opportunity in many stocks. Airlines, cruise lines, and transportation stocks could be among the hardest-hit sectors. I would buy weakness on any major pullbacks in these sectors. I would also consider buying the recent weakness in stocks like Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Summary </h3> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a lot going on, and this is not over, but the initial results of this strike on Iran do not suggest a worst-case scenario for oil prices or the financial markets. I would watch Bitcoin prices over the weekend as a proxy for risk assets and then futures on Sunday night to prepare for what might come for investors next week. As things stand now, I expect a relief rally for stocks, but this could change if matters escalate. However, I would use any sharp market pullback as a potential buying opportunity.</p>",

In this report, I discuss how this may affect the global markets with attention to energy, freight and logistics, airlines, crypto, aerospace, and defense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: War often comes with an unmeasurable amount of human tragedy and a fair bit of geopolitics. While I am cognizant of these factors, this report does not intend to discuss either the human tragedy or the politics behind the most recent combat action but aims to provide qualitative analysis of its impacts on markets, crypto(currencies), and commodities.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Strikes In Iran Hardly Come As A Surprise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the strikes hardly come as a surprise, as President Trump previously already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/13/politics/us-iran-aircraft-carrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">communicated</a> that he had the USS Gerald R. Ford in the region. It is the second aircraft carrier that has been deployed to the Middle East along with its strike group. The carrier arrived at the Israeli coast yesterday. So, the fact that strikes occurred today is not surprising. We also note that in the weeks prior, a large movement of fighter jets, military cargo airplanes, civil cargo airplanes, and tankers occurred. These airplanes were initially placed in Sofia (Bulgaria) and Crete. I live roughly 300 km away from Sofia in Bucharest and already noticed increased military flight activity over the past days. From my time living in Sibiu (the NATO Headquarters Multinational Corps Southeast) and the war in Ukraine, I also know that increased military flight activity usually is a prelude to an attack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strikes currently are relatively contained. Iran has responded with targeting assets in countries in the Middle East, but for the time being we are not seeing a full-blown air or ground attack.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Off Mode To Hurt Equities And Crypto</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets already have been in a relatively strong risk-off mode, but my expectation is that this will intensify. Higher risk assets such as cryptocurrencies will be under pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) has fallen 1.7%, but we note that following the attack, Bitcoin prices had fallen as much as 3.5%. Year-to-date, Bitcoin is down more than 25%, so the attacks in Iran are likely to pressure sentiment further. Ethereum (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETH-USD\" title=\"Ethereum USD\">ETH-USD</a>) has fallen in line with Bitcoin. So, overall, among the two major cryptocurrencies, we see a modestly lower price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Generally, equity markets (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF\">QQQ</a></span>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>) are expected also to be under pressure as investors process the attacks that already happened and weigh the uncertainty ahead, as we are not seeing a full blown escalation yet. For equity markets, the picture is not necessarily fully negative or positive. The initial reaction will more than likely be negative, but from there the technical picture (holding key support levels) is going to matter as well as how the conflict evolves. If a response from Iran is in some way unmeasured or escalatory, then we will see an acceleration in the rotation out of stocks towards safer assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil Companies Set To Benefit</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>) are likely set to benefit as oil prices head higher, and even in the short term, some money may flow into oil related equities driven by sentiment. Companies that are not set to benefit are midstream companies, which derive most of their income from commodity-neutral pricing schemes. We do note that demand for oil remains weak. So, the fluctuations in oil prices and the benefit that oil companies can derive from that are largely going to depend on the ability of oil shippers to supply. A more long-lived opportunity would present itself for higher oil prices and stock prices for oil companies if critical oil production and transportation infrastructure were being destroyed. However, we also note that an escalation could affect demand for oil due to weaker macroeconomic growth, and many countries can actually produce more barrels than they are currently doing. So, it would take a large scale evaporation of oil production and transportation capability to spark a major imbalance between supply and demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freight And Logistics: A Mixed Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1670\" data-height=\"1246\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the Strait of Hormuz traffic\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Marine Traffic</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For freight and logistics companies, the picture is overall a mixed one. Oil tanker companies are likely set to benefit. The reason is that a closure of the strait does not reduce demand for oil, but it does mean many tankers will be locked in their place in the Persian Gulf. The Fujairah pipeline in the UAE and the East-West Crude Oil Pipeline connecting the Saudi eastern oil fields to the Red Sea port have limited capacity. Combined, these pipelines could process just 34% of the flow of barrels through the Strait of Hormuz. So, we are likely going to see some spike in oil transportation rates. War risk insurance premiums are likely going to increase, but that also drives shippers to not enter the strait and explore other opportunities that drive longer voyages, creating a higher ton-mile effect. Putting it simply, the usable fleet shrinks as fear makes shipping scarce, while effective capacity is being reduced through longer voyages as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For general trade, we note there is only a positive effect if there is a spillover of the conflict to other key routes such as the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, or Bab-el-Mandeb. These are key to the access to the Suez Canal. If the Suez Canal is inaccessible, it means longer voyages are required, meaning that effective capacity is lowered and freight rates increase. Absent a conflict spillover, the global cargo shippers are going to see just the higher cost effect of oil as a fuel. This indirectly increases shipping rates to pass through higher operational costs but also may result in route optimization, network redesign, and slow steaming to save fuel. All of these could disrupt existing global trade routes and capacity and increase rates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airlines Do Not Do Well On Geopolitical Tension And War</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1386\" data-height=\"1039\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows an Emirates A380 airplane.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Emirates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airlines are the clear loser in this. Airline stocks are volatile and react to disruptions fast. At the time of writing, the airports of Doha, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi are among the airports that are closed. United Airlines (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UAL\" title=\"United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\">UAL</a>) and American Airlines (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAL\" title=\"American Airlines Group Inc.\">AAL</a>), with European airlines such as Lufthansa (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLAKF\" title=\"Deutsche Lufthansa AG\">DLAKF</a>), Air France-KLM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRAF\" title=\"Air France-KLM SA\">AFRAF</a>), and British Airways (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICAGY\" title=\"International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A.\">ICAGY</a>) are no longer flying to the Middle East. It creates missed revenues, and recalibrating capacity may weaken unit revenues in other markets. So, there is an immediate cost and revenue effect that is likely modest, but the longer this takes, the more the missed revenues and profits compound and the higher the risk that airlines will have to deploy capacity elsewhere and weaken fare prices in those markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cargo freight rates may increase as airlines avoid the Middle East, and the same holds for passenger airlines, but the effect for passenger airlines is much less positive than it could be for cargo airlines.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aerospace and Defense Is The Clear Winner</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"800\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows fighter jets.\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>US Air Force</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clear winner, more than likely in terms of sentiment, is aerospace and defense.

We are already seeing that there is an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864573-the-1-2-trillion-aerospace-and-defense-supercycle\">aerospace and defense supercycle,</a> and while aerospace and defense companies are not going to be winning new contracts tomorrow, sentiment is likely to improve for investment in aerospace and defense, and the recent events support a prolonged elevation of defense budgets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the flight radar, there are tens and maybe hundreds of airplanes we do not see. However, we see an Airbus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">EADSF</a>) refueling airplane airborne as well as an Airbus tactical transport airplane. Furthermore, we see an MQ-9 Reaper airborne and a Boeing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>) F-15 with its transponder turned on. Furthermore, I am aware of flight activity for the C-5, F-35 and F-22 built by Lockheed Martin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>) and the E-3, P-8A, C-17A, KC-135 and KC-46A by Boeing. So, Boeing and Lockheed Martin provide a lot of air power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, there are strike carrier groups for the Abraham Lincoln and Gerald R Ford aircraft carriers built by Huntington Ingalls Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HII\" title=\"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.\">HII</a>) consisting of the guided-missile destroyers of the Arleigh Burke class built by HII and General Dynamics and littoral combat ships built by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875203-austal-upgraded-to-strong-buy-on-defense-re-rating\">Austal</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUTLF\" title=\"Austal Limited\">AUTLF</a>) and Fincantieri (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FNCNF\" title=\"Fincantieri S.p.A.\">FNCNF</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On those ships, there likely will be F-35 and F/A-18 fighter jets, helicopters and tactical aircraft and ships and aircraft will be equipped with missiles. Stitching all of that together is a layer of intelligence equipment. So, we are looking at a broad-based deployment from ships, fighter jets, helicopters, intelligence airplanes, tankers, missiles, missile defense and radars. It makes it a broad-based deployment of US made equipment, which I believe will draw investor attention. Another company that likely will see positive attention is Elbit Systems. Elbit is an Israeli company and given that Israel is involved in the combat action I do expect it to be one of the stocks in focus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, while there will not be any fundamental support for higher stock prices for aerospace and defense companies we will likely see improved sentiment and support for higher defense budgets over the longer-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodity Prices: Oil Shock And Gold As Safe Haven</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows an oil production facility in Saudi Arabia.\" width=\"640\" height=\"469\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARAMCO</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For commodity prices, the expectation is that those will increase. Given the importance of the Middle East for oil production, oil is likely to spike. We already note that Brent Futures (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM\" class=\"ticker-link\">CO1:COM</a>) are up 2.9%. So, we are looking at the Strait of Hormuz effect as this is a crucial waterway for global oil trade. The narrow passage between Iran and Oman is set to become the literal bottleneck for global oil trade. Daily, around 20-21 million barrels pass through this strait, and it is highly likely that there will be disruptions. We are already seeing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-gas-majors-traders-suspend-shipments-via-hormuz-us-attacks-iran-sources-say-2026-02-28\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> of oil and gas majors and traders suspending shipments via Hormuz. So, oil and gas will head up, and a further escalation of the conflict or a prolonged war would further increase those prices limited by development of demand in the macroeconomic picture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the risk off sentiment is likely to intensify, we will see a spike in gold prices. So, Gold is once again going to fulfill its role of safe haven, attracting liquidity exiting the equity and cryptocurrency markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">USD Likely To Strengthen</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As investors liquidate positions and we note that buying safe-haven assets and oil is usually dollar-denominated, we are likely going to see the USD strengthen. Quite often we see that investors view the power position that the US has as a favor that is being done to the world. That is, however, not fully the case. The power projection, both politically and militarily, also serves as a strengthening mechanism for the US Dollar and I believe we will see this in play as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overview Of Impacts Of Combat Action In Iran</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ideally, we would be able to provide a playbook on which parts of the markets will win and which ones will lose. The reality, however, is that there currently is a lot of uncertainty. We do not know whether military actions have been successful and the duration of military action and responses. So, the duration and military impact and consequences for the region and world are not known at this point in time. So, we are only able to map, the near-term expected impacts. I have done that in the diagram below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"719\" data-height=\"1069\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows how military action may affect asset classes\" width=\"640\" height=\"952\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Aerospace Forum</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What we see is that military action brings several axes along sentiment and rotation of funds can take place. These axes are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Disruption in logistics affecting flights and shipping capacity</li> <li>Higher oil prices</li> <li>Risk sentiment recalibration</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher oil prices are beneficial for oil companies and there likely will also be some risk-on sentiment for oil and gas companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk sentiment recalibration currently is expected to drive the majority of the market movements. Risk off sentiment will negatively affect cryptocurrencies, equity markets and airlines while USD and Gold are likely to strengthen. Risk-on sentiment for now is likely only expected to strongly benefit aerospace and defense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Disruptions due to air space closures are a negative for airlines while the combination of limited shipping capacity available and war risk premiums will benefit oil shippers. Global maritime has a mixed set of inputs. Rerouting and conflict spillover would limit available shipping capacity, which is a positive. However, higher oil prices drive up operational costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: First Reaction Is Sentiment Drive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first reaction in the markets will be driven by risk sentiment calibration. For the equity market, the extent of declines is going to be determined by holding key technical support levels. Beyond that, the duration and effect of the military action are going to become increasingly more dominant to give the market direction.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Inc.\">KKR</a>). As such, it lends primarily to private equity-sponsored middle market companies through a diversified set of investments, most of which are senior secured loans that earn it contractual senior-in-the-capital-stack investments, senior-in-the-capital-stack cash flows via interest payments, and then it returns the vast majority of those to shareholders via dividends after taking off management's cut via base management and performance incentive fees. In turn, it provides what should be professional underwriting expertise and active management of its loan portfolio to try to generate outsized risk-adjusted returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio is pretty well diversified across 232 companies, with its top 10 positions taking up about 19.4% of fair value.

While there are plenty of externally managed BDCs out there, including Ares Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>) (by Ares Management (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARES\" title=\"Ares Management Corporation\">ARES</a>)) and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) (by Blackstone (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\">BX</a>)), both of which have done pretty well by shareholders and thus have earned their trust, FSK appears to be a case where management is purely milking the BDC for fees.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Buyback Question That Won’t Go Away</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the purest examples of this is how management allocates capital whenever the BDC is trading at a material discount to NAV. In BXSL's case, they have bought back stock fairly substantially whenever it has traded at a discount to NAV. And you see this with other externally-managed BDCs, including most recently Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>), which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875806-12-percent-yield-trading-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-blue-owl-capital\">bought back stock aggressively</a> last quarter when it traded down to a significant discount to NAV. Meanwhile, FSK has bought back stock in the past, but now that its discount to NAV has widened, analysts pressed management on the earnings call quite aggressively about what their thoughts were for buybacks. Below is an excerpt from the earnings call where this Q&amp;A took place:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Casey Alexander</strong><em>Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>I have one question and one follow-up. My first question is, look, I hate to bring up what might seem like a tired old refrain. But at the moment, the stock is trading at 55% of book, and that kind of screams not to invest in new loans, but to take repayments and start buying the stock.</p> <p>Could you guys give us some feeling for your temper in regards to beginning to initiate meaningful stock repurchases? And I know -- look, I know the employees have bought the stock. I know the advisers bought the stock. But at this point in time, your only road to increasing NAV at this point in time is accretive share repurchases at such a dramatic discount to book value.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Pietrzak</strong><em>President, Chief Investment Officer &amp; Director</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Yes. Casey, thanks for the question. I think we understand the point there. I think as the entity, these numbers might not be perfect, but I think we have historically bought back $350 million of stock. That's probably more than sort of most out there. It is something that we do have to consider. I think the only thing on the other side of that, that I just need to be mindful about is the market noise and/or volatility.</p> <p>And I do believe some of that is overdone out there broadly, but that's kind of top of mind and then where we're at vis-a-vis sort of leverage and target leverage. But it is, yes, something that we will be talking about.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Casey Alexander</strong><em>Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Yes. And the fact that maybe some of the movement in the stock is related to broader market noise would argue even more, I would think, to buying it here because some of that will then be relieved by the absence of the market noise, and this would be the most accretive level.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then later on in the earnings call:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Richard Shane</strong><em>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Look, Casey really covered, I think, as far as I'm concerned, the most important structural issue in terms of repurchasing shares. Look, you guys had over $5 billion come in last year, $5 billion the year before that. Presumably, the run rate in terms of repayments will be similar this year, which should provide a fair amount of liquidity for repurchases.</p> <p>I haven't -- listening to all the BDC calls, I haven't heard anybody make a super compelling case for, wow, there's this incredible dislocation, this opportunity to deploy capital into new loans that's so attractive. What is out there that's actually more accretive to both earnings and again, to NAV than repurchasing shares at this point?</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Pietrzak</strong><em>President, Chief Investment Officer &amp; Director</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Yes. And thanks for the question, Rick. I think the investing environment has been -- maybe the right word is interesting over the last handful of years, right? There's been a lot of different forms of market events to the market. I think on the direct lending side, to be fair, has felt decently tight in terms of -- you have seen spread compression. I think a lot of that has had to do with the fact of inflows were high.</p> <p>I do think the inflows from the wealth channel was a driver of that, and that was really coupled with, let's call it, lower-than-normal M&amp;A volume. So you can talk about a little bit of a market technical out there. I think the offset to that is, I think the quality of the companies that have been accessing the market has been strong. I think the size of the companies that have been accessing the market has been good.</p> <p>I think we prefer to lend to those larger companies. I think the thing we have tried to focus on is getting diversification in the book, right? So that was growing the joint venture was one form of that. We got up to the target number. We have seen some compelling opportunities in the asset-based finance. We talked about some of those on prior deals -- I'm sorry, prior calls, either the Harley-Davidson or the PayPal.</p> <p>But I understand the point. I think we need to take all that into consideration as we move forward. I would say one thing. I probably am expecting a more lender-friendly environment as we go through the course of '26. I think that will very much skew based upon how open the capital markets is, which it is pretty open right now. But I think you'll see the flows maybe sort of temper a bit, and then you'll have to see what happens in the capital markets as the sort of probably primary driver of that. But our eyes are focused on it.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was so jarring was management's completely noncommittal take on buybacks. A quality manager, for example, OBDC, would not just talk about buying back stock. It would show how it was actively buying back stock and how it would have a plan in place to do so. FSK did none of this and simply said that they are going to have to think about it, while also hedging by saying that they do expect a more attractive lending environment moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This strikes us as very revealing, given that spreads in the sector have actually been tightening significantly over the past year, so new loans are generally offering much lower yields than the ones that are being repaid right now. Thus, if management were at all concerned about shareholder value rather than maximizing the fees they earn from assets under management, they would be buying back stock aggressively with the proceeds from repaid loans, as well as any excess retained net investment income after they just slashed their dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This would not only show good faith to investors but also help to stabilize and potentially even increase NAV per share, given that at these prices, they could literally be buying a dollar of NAV for ~$0.50. Given the mid- to high-teens dividend yield on the current stock price and even higher NII per share yield on the current stock price, it is virtually impossible to imagine them finding a better place to invest that money right now than in buying back their own stock. Thus, their unwillingness to do so speaks either to a management team that appears to be heavily conflicted between maximizing fees for the sponsor and protecting shareholder value, or a management team that has little confidence that their stock is actually worth close to what they are marking its NAV at.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Cut, Rising Risks, And A Troubling Signal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the balance sheet remains in decent shape, with a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.22x, which is within management's target range of 1.0x to 1.25x, and is also in line with many of their peers. The company also had plenty of liquidity, with $3.8 billion worth of it at quarter's end. This is enough to earn them investment-grade credit ratings from Moody's, Fitch, and Kroll.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, the company did have $1 billion worth of notes that came due in January of this year at just a 3.4% fixed interest rate, which means that their interest expense will be going up moving forward, starting in Q1, providing an additional drag to NII per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this means that their recent steep dividend cut is not surprising, especially in the wake of Federal Reserve rate cuts and FSK's weakening NAV per share. That being said, with a $0.45 per share base dividend plus a $0.03 per share supplemental dividend, their dividend yield today is still sky high, given how far their stock price has plunged, such that it trades at a near 50% discount to NAV. With a 16.7% annualized current base dividend and a 17.8% annualized base plus supplemental dividend yield, FSK's income yield is extremely attractive right now, especially if it can sustain that at least for a while. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, while management previously guided to a 10% dividend yield on NAV, the current 9% dividend yield on NAV also signals a lack of confidence from management into even the quality of its current NAV, which, along with the lack of commitment to buybacks, indicates to the market that there could be more weakness ahead beyond what the headline numbers are showing. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fee Structure Red Flags And A Prospect Capital Parallel</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet another strike against FSK's management, however, came on the earnings call when an analyst questioned them about their fee structure. This was quite telling because other externally-managed BDCs that have fallen on hard times recently have slashed their fee structure. For example, Oaktree Specialty Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OCSL\" title=\"Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation\">OCSL</a>) and Goldman Sachs BDC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSBD\" title=\"Goldman Sachs BDC\">GSBD</a>) both reduced their fees due to underwriting weakness in their portfolios. Therefore, it was entirely reasonable for the analysts to ask FSK about considering doing the same thing. In fact, if you compare them to other externally managed BDCs, they are on the more expensive side, with a fee structure that is almost as expensive as ARCC's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"937\" data-height=\"424\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GBDC Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, management simply said they are cognizant of that and are \"mapping to the market,\" and will discuss it amongst themselves, but made no commitment to a fee reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the precedent from other companies that have announced fee reductions in the same quarter that they released bombshell negative results, that would have probably been a prudent thing to do. And given that they didn't, it only furthered the impression to Mr. Market that FSK is in the business of milking fees from shareholders rather than actually trying to create long-term shareholder value. In this sense, it is reminding us increasingly of Prospect Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSEC\" title=\"Prospect Capital Corporation\">PSEC</a>), which has done something similar over the long term and in the process has proven to be a serial destroyer of shareholder value:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, it is not surprising at all to see FSK's P/NAV get cut in half over the past year, as the market has gone from viewing this BDC as a respectable fund that was trying to create value for shareholders to a perennial underperformer that is simply milking shareholders for fees:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Has To Change Before I Even Consider Buying</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that said, what is the forward outlook for the company? First and foremost, the company needs to find a way to stabilize its NAV per share, which includes both improved underwriting, positive workouts of existing issues, and, very importantly, buying back stock aggressively at these levels. However, it appears that investors should not be holding their breath for the latter, and we'll have to see in terms of underwriting performance, though the track record at FSK is not encouraging there either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, the discount is so enormous, and the dividend yield is so huge, that FSK can still continue to have some underwriting issues and not buy back any stock, and still potentially, over the long term, deliver significant total returns. The biggest risk here, though, is that they will continue to have material credit performance deterioration. Given management's weak dividend yield per NAV relative to its previous guidance, as well as lack of commitment to buybacks, not to mention the broader concerns in the industry about the health of private credit, there is not a whole lot of positive takeaway or reason for optimism over the long term with FSK's credit performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, while the yield is huge and the discount to NAV is even more mouth-watering, I need to have a management team that I can fully get behind. They don't need to be the most brilliant minds or the shrewdest operators in the industry, but they, at the very least, need to convince me that they are looking out for shareholder interests rather than just milking the fund for fees. I've seen too many examples of externally managed funds, whether it be PSEC or the previously externally-managed Global Net Lease (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNL\" title=\"Global Net Lease, Inc.\">GNL</a>) in the REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ\" title=\"Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF\">VNQ</a>) sector, where they've looked extremely cheap only to continue letting shareholders down again and again, all while enriching management with high fees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want to buy a small position in FSK as a speculative play due to the incredibly deep discount and the high yield, given that the non-accruals are not that high and KKR is a fairly reputable manager and underwriter, I think there are definitely worse bets you can take right now. However, given that there are plenty of high-quality BDCs with credible management teams that have strong underlying fundamentals and are trading at large discounts right now, I am not going to buy FSK for now and instead will keep it on my watch list.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I see management in the next quarter buying back stock, considering a fee reduction, and/or improving its underwriting performance, and thereby proving to me that they are actually looking out for shareholders, I will seriously consider buying it, especially if it continues to trade at a steep discount to NAV. In the meantime, I will continue to focus on the higher-quality yet still undervalued segment of the BDC sector in my 7-8% yielding, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/47771937-samuel-smith/6260780-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\">total return outperforming</a>, and below-market beta portfolios at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",
