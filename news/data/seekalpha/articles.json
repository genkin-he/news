Thus, it should pave the way for the recent outperformance to hang on firmly, and not devolve into another potentially disastrous selloff, as investors scrutinize whether the recent surge has been overstated.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Intel Foundry's Bloodshed Far From Over</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1423\" data-height=\"799\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Intel foundry segment\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-17619112071615918_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Intel foundry segment <span>(Intel filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/db/887/9148/earnings_presentation/Q3+2025+Earnings+Deck+Revised.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/db/887/9148/earnings_presentation/Q3+2025+Earnings+Deck+Revised.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Intel's Q3 earnings scorecard</a> demonstrates that execution has clearly improved under the leadership of CEO Lip-Bu Tan. It corresponds to Wall Street's outlook that INTC's margins should have bottomed in late 2024, although foundry continues to be a massive margin bleeder, recording almost -55% in segment operating margin in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, encouraging signals from the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832837-intel-corporation-intc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832837-intel-corporation-intc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing ramp up of Intel's 18A</a> indicates that the low watermark reached last year should be a thing of the past. Accordingly, Intel had already communicated confident guidance in October, as it telegraphed that <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/news/2025-10-09_Intel_Unveils_Panther_Lake_Architecture_First_AI_1752.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/news/2025-10-09_Intel_Unveils_Panther_Lake_Architecture_First_AI_1752.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Panther Lake</a> (based on the 18A process) had moved into volume production, highlighting the positive cadence implied in its roadmap through 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And of course, I had already enunciated the confidence boost that Intel has been afforded by the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824297-nvidia-and-intel-more-than-just-strategic-messaging-why-both-need-it\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824297-nvidia-and-intel-more-than-just-strategic-messaging-why-both-need-it\" target=\"_blank\">recent Nvidia investment</a> (which the firm expects to close in 2025), while also having the U.S. government's as one of its cornerstone shareholders. Is Intel foundry ready to prove that 1<span>8</span>A could finally be the moment for it to mark a monumental turnaround yet?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, I think it's too early for us to ascertain, but the recent progress augurs well as it works on an x86-based chip with Nvidia, which speaks volumes of the company's sticky x86 architecture ecosystem. And management is right to highlight that even as the potential <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-nvidia-worth-5-trillion-inside-35-billion-ai-datacenter-2025-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-nvidia-worth-5-trillion-inside-35-billion-ai-datacenter-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\">data center capacity</a> is expected to explode multifold through 2030, CPUs are still expected to play a pivotal role in the buildout, providing the runway for Intel to partake in the AI inflection, even though it hasn't quite validated its ability to compete against Nvidia, AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) or even Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>) when it comes to supplying OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPEN\" title=\"Opendoor Technologies Inc.\">OPEN</a>) with the most cutting-edge of AI chips. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, I thought Qualcomm's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a>) recent AI chip unveiling was telling, showing that investors shouldn't write off the chip design capabilities of the semiconductor behemoths like Intel, notwithstanding the struggles that it has been through. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Intel's liquidity and capital allocation strategies are expected to be a lot more disciplined, despite expecting to post a higher CapEx range for 2025 to the tune of $27<span> billion</span>. Nevertheless, it does appear that the delayed AI PC ramp could experience a much-needed liftoff from 2026/27, as Intel underscored what every investor arguably wanted to hear: the company is supply constrained. It suggests that Intel's demand dynamics have likely been bolstered, which should help to continue paving the way for its operating margins to recover, even though we should be cautious in trying to ascribe too much optimism this early into the ramp. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Intel: Margin Worries Should Subside, But Don't Bank On A Hockey Stick Inflection</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3026\" data-height=\"2017\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Intel margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Intel margins <span>(TIKR)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the optionality of having Intel foundry be a positive margins driver in the future is alluring, I believe the market won't be fooled into putting too much hopium into the thesis for now, until validated. And with TSMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) being so dominant and relied upon right now by the leading chip designers and the hyperscalers, I don't assess it as reasonable for us (yet) to give the benefit of the doubt about the plausible revival in this segment for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, while Wall Street forecasts that Intel's CapEx growth should slow down markedly through 2027, the ongoing margin recovery will likely still be driven by the positive outlook in the PC business, while being impeded to a lesser extent due to the ongoing losses in its foundry business. In other words, I believe there's a ceiling on how much operating leverage gains Intel could squeeze out from its unprofitable foundry business, while still relying on a relatively mature PC market to lead the overall recovery. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell INTC Stock? </h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2088\" data-height=\"1348\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"INTC price chart (long-term, monthly)\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">INTC price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And when we consider the incredible surge that saw INTC take out levels last observed in early 2024, I think the momentum is clearly too fast and too furious. Obviously, investors are banking on the renewed vigor underlining its narrative, with the investments inked with the U.S. government and Nvidia as the bedrock of its recent gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because, while I concur that Intel's Q3 release has shown us that execution appears to be firmly on the right track amid a relatively sanguine market right now, I'm not sure whether INTC's &gt;90x forward earnings multiple is truly justified. It seems like the market is betting on an even more spectacular restoration of its business fundamentals through 2027, or even the potential gain of crucial foundry customers due to the assumed lack of foundry capacity to deliver the 250GW in data center capacity that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834017-oracle-i-cant-ignore-the-loud-echoes-of-euphoria-now\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834017-oracle-i-cant-ignore-the-loud-echoes-of-euphoria-now\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a> is reportedly gunning for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these are certainly pivotal aspects in Intel's incredible turnaround story to salivate over, I think the market could have taken their exuberance way too far, as there's still little for Intel to show for in these businesses at the current moment, or even for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't anticipate Intel announcing a gargantuan partnership with OpenAI at the moment, while hyperscalers are arguably not going to send their custom chips to Intel to fab, if Nvidia isn't leading the way as a flagship customer to validate Intel's production yields first. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are enough reasons for me to urge investors who didn't manage to join INTC's stellar ascent to sit out, while contemplating other higher-quality setups among its peers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Maintain \"Hold.\" </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Book value rose 6%. The common share count also increased by 16%. This was a double-barreled benefit to the equity/coverage ratio, which jumped 23%, now sitting at 17x - the highest level in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leverage fell from 8.3x to 7.5x - also good to see. The company has tended to be tactical with its leverage, lowering it when agency spreads fall, as was the case during the quarter. That's a favorable strategy, as it means it won’t be too greedy when agencies are expensive and due for a spread widening. This is why its portfolio performed so well over the COVID quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income Preferreds Tool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"608\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income Preferreds Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the sections below, we highlight some of the concerns that investors have expressed regarding the stock as well as the mREIT preferreds sector more broadly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Price Worries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One concern is that falling short-term rates will bring prices lower as well. DX.PR.C is a floating-rate preferred, and Fed rate cuts will push its dividend lower as well. This is a common concern and is highly intuitive - after all, if the stock is now generating less income, wouldn't investors find it less attractive and, hence, sell it, driving the price lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The short answer here is that short-term rates are not a significant driver of prices of floating-rate assets. This is for two reasons. One, slightly technical, is that short-term rates drive both the cash flows of the floating-rate security as well as the discount factors that are applied to it in generating a risk-neutral price. When short-term interest rates change, the impact of these factors cancels each other out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason is more empirical. We can look at the prices of DX.PR.C (which only floated in April of this year) as well as of NLY.PR.F and AGNCN, which have been floating for several years. What we see is that when the Fed cut rates 4 times at the end of 2024, there was no impact on these securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income Preferreds Tool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"567\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income Preferreds Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, this doesn't mean that floating-rate securities aren't sensitive to anything. Rather, they are sensitive to credit spreads which we can view as either systemic (general risk aversion in credit markets) or something idiosyncratic to the individual asset.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Redemption Worries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another persistent concern that investors have is that the stock will be redeemed. This has two components. One, an income-generating asset may be called away just as there are few other attractive opportunities. And two, there may be a small price hit on the redemption. For example, DX.PR.C trades around 2.8% above \"par\" in stripped price terms. This means that an immediate redemption would be a hit of around 2% (after accounting for the required notice period and the coupon accrual in that time). That's real money, even if it is made up in a couple of months of accrual.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You'd have to be very unlucky to lose money on the stock on a quick redemption after a purchase. That said, it does make sense to time the purchase on a dip (in stripped price terms). However, if the stock is acquired above \"par,\" the longer the position is maintained, the less impactful is the redemption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A common question related to the redemption likelihood is why does DX want to pay 9%+ on the preferred when it can fund itself with repo at less than half the rate? The short answer is that the preferred shouldn't be compared with repo because it's not debt. Rather, it is cheap equity. It should be compared not with the repo rate but with the dividend on common shares, which is considerably higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the greatest determinant of preferreds redemption is the level of credit spread now versus time of issuance. The stock was issued shortly before COVID when high-yield credit spreads were around 3.6% at 5.461% over the unsecured short-term rate (3-month Libor at that point). Today's spreads are around 3%. Arguably, the company's preferred credit spread premium over high-yield bonds is less than it was in 2020. It is a more known entity now, and the stock's equity/preferred coverage is higher. Both of these factors suggest that if the company were to refinance, it would pay a lower credit spread than it did when it issued DX.PR.C.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, we don't know exactly how much less the market would demand than the original spread of 5.461% today, and neither does the company. There are no other DX preferreds, and the stock is pinned-to-par, i.e., the spread it is paying is higher than it would be for a non-callable security, meaning price discovery is challenging. It's likely the market would settle for quite a bit less than the spread of 5.461%, but there is some uncertainty around this. DX would also have to pay something like 2-3% to refinance DX.PR.C, so all of this creates friction to a refinancing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, we wouldn't be shocked if DX.PR.C is redeemed, but it remains unlikely in our view as the lack of redemption on the first call date is a signal that the company is happy to keep the preferred outstanding.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Yield Worries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A final worry is that the drop in short-term rates means the yield of the stock is not particularly compelling. After all, who wants to hold a position whose dividend keeps falling?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, individual securities don't exist in isolation, so let's see where the stripped yield of DX.PR.C stands relative to its fixed-rate counterpart - high-yield corporate bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we chart the historic yield differential between the two, we get the following chart.

One, the relevant yield curve remains unusually flat, meaning floating-rate securities are generating an attractive level of income relative to fixed-rate securities. One element that is often ignored is that short-term rates don't just affect the base rate of floating-rate securities. They obviously affect the entire yield curve as longer-term rates are simply longer-term expectations of short-term rates plus an inflation premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, longer-term rates have already adjusted to the market view of 4-5 more Fed rate cuts to come. And sure, investors can fix that 5-year rate today, but it's not like investors buying fixed-rate bonds can pull a fast one and avoid the rate cuts that are due to affect short-term rates. The coming rate cuts are already baked into long-term rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the second reason why the yield of DX.PR.C is and will remain relatively elevated versus high-yield corporate bonds is that the stock is pinned-to-par. Because it is callable, it is not going to move more than 2-3% above \"par\" in stripped price terms. This is because investors don't want to take a hit in case the stock is redeemed. And because this dynamic keeps the price anchored around \"par\", its yield is higher than it would be if the stock were not callable. In short, investors are getting paid a higher yield by virtue of the redemption risk than they would otherwise.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stance and Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DX.PR.C remains arguably the best risk/reward in the entire income space at a 9.4% yield (based on today's 3-month term SOFR). This will move lower as the Fed cuts but only very slowly. There is a relatively high call price risk of -2.8%, however, the first call date was in April and the company looks to be in no hurry to redeem it. The stock has been trading a bit above \"par\" for a long while now and will likely remain pinned-to-par unless credit spreads seriously blow out, perhaps doubling from here. This makes it an unusually low-beta asset as well.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For new positions, we would look for the clean price to move towards $25.40 or so where it drops occasionally. Other stocks in the sector have a lower stripped yield and a lower call price hit in case of redemption - not a coincidence. Investors who worry about this should consider a stock like AGNCP, which has a yield of 8.95% (as of today's 3-month term SOFR) but trades below \"par\" in stripped price terms, meaning there is no hit in case of redemption.</p>",

If we then raise this wall with cash and not leverage, all the better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"602\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital, Trading View\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital, Trading View</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS, which has worried everyone recently, has returned to growth at 20%, and believe me, this isn't an isolated case or a stroke of luck, but rather a capacity for expansion and the company's ability to adopt AI solutions that can be monetized on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a>. Extraordinary expenses weighed negatively on the whole, obscuring the real leverage in North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, there are AI tools like Rufus and the seller suite drive conversions. We're here, we're in the era of AI that monetizes. It's a reality. There are undoubtedly risks. I address them in the dedicated section below, but at the moment I see more upside potential than downside risks. At these levels, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511697-amazon-surges-after-q3-beat-driven-by-aws-ad-growth-offsetting-margin-pressures\">despite the market's post-results reaction</a>, the asymmetry remains favorable. In the long term, I remain positive on the stock and my TP is set within the <em>$269-$286 range.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the quarterly results were released, I looked at the results, saw the after-hours reaction, and closed everything. I was calm; I had the stock in my portfolio, and I would have calmly dedicated myself to poring over the financial statements. Then Apple arrived, and I was surprised by its market reaction (first a 5% selloff and then an 8% recovery from the low).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I said to myself: we urgently need to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835961-apple-q3-stocks-crash-then-rise-why-rating-upgrade\">understand what's happening</a> with Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>). Amazon, on the other hand, is calm. With a cool head, I started analyzing the stock, and I don't want to bore you with an endless list of financial data. I arrived the next day to write this piece, and in the meantime, even better analysts than me have already analyzed the numbers and highlighted what worked and what didn't. Furthermore, I must say that Seeking Alpha does an excellent job of promptly reporting every company result, so the details are here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The battle for supremacy in the coming years won't be decided by the most beautiful and brilliant software, the one that does the fastest calculations. I feel like I've said that often. The real winners will be energy stocks (especially nuclear, for example) and chipmakers. In this entire context, Amazon is playing its digital industrial game, increasing capacity, dedicated clusters (Trainium2/Rainier), and expanding order visibility. In all of this, many see capex as a problem, but I see a player buying up compute shares before competitors. It's doing what a shark (or whale) should do: eating everything before the others arrive. Sure, you might get upset sometimes, but in the meantime, you'll be full. The others will starve.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'll start by saying that the <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Webslides_Q325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">published numbers</a>, viewed as they are, don't really tell the story of the quarter. They include one-off costs (such as the FTC fine and severance packages) that make retail margins appear worse than they actually are. If we eliminate these exogenous factors, the situation changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"102\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"65\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>, the retail margin appears to be slowing, but in reality, it's a matter of perspective because North America is back where it belongs, with a 6.9% operating margin on $106.3B of sales, not the 4.5% you see at a glance.

I'm not advocating pretending these cost items are not there. Companies naturally come across events of this kind; certainly, income statement is impacted. The question is distinct: how many yearly times do they manifest themselves? Are they \"business as usual\"? I don't think so. What I'm trying to say is that to see the long term, it might be useful to separate and clean up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have achieved actual monetization on the front lines of artificial intelligence. It's concrete rather than marketing. While the Ads department is extending reach beyond the Amazon ecosystem and sustaining very high margins, the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rufus assistant</a> is boosting conversions and frequency of purchase. And so, more demand generated inside, less reliance on outside referrals, and clearer and more environmentally friendly retail profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"63\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AWS segment growing by 20% is what I call the \"<em>second cycle</em>\" (AI compute and capacity growth). The backlog is significant, and the new clusters—CPUs, GPUs, memory, storage, high-speed networking—are filling up rapidly, and that's the main point. So, we're talking about a phase in which AI is starting to truly monetize and become part of existing business processes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'd also like to point out another aspect that I found interesting. Did they mention the tariff issue? No reference in calls; not because they don't exist but rather because the model is immune already (local network, stable 3P mix, high-margin ADS).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last point: capex. I mentioned it in the introductory part of the article. Some see AI investments as a huge waste of resources, or simply too excessive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"783\" data-height=\"494\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some build ratios based on GDP, make comparisons with 2000, then go back a few years, adjusting for inflation. In short, there's been a lot of talk lately. For me, capex is simply a barrier, and I'm happy that companies like Amazon want to defend their technological dominance by spending today and reaping tomorrow. As an investor, I'm happy. Those who build first, monetize first. The only thing I'd ask management is the utilization rate of new clusters and ramp times.

Essentially, the stock continues to rise, while the multiple compresses by about 7%, so the performance was earnings-driven, not re-rating-driven. I don't know if I'm explaining myself, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle. It's obvious that at these valuations, it's difficult to buy everything in the stock—not even I would—but as long as price growth is driven by earnings growth, there's little to argue about.

Critical mineral MOUs were signed with Malaysia and Thailand, and a potential deal with Brazil was ironed out on the sidelines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil is of importance here because they have been stepping in to provide China with food exports while they have been forgoing US soybeans in protest of trade policy changes. China does not produce as much food as it consumes and so relies on these exports to sustain its population. Initially in April, the US was hoping to use this food export reliance as leverage in trade negotiations with China, but it fell flat when Brazil was able to step in and fill the gap. A deal with Lula will be helpful to Trump because Brazilian cooperation is essential for the China containment policy to work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"507\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Soybean output to China\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>American Soybean Association</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan Lowers Their Tariffs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After ASEAN, President Trump headed to Japan, which had just elected its first female Prime Minister, Takaichi. There, the 25% tariff initially put on Japanese goods has been lowered to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This came in exchange for a pledge of a $550 billion investment in the US. I assume that this will come in the form of foreign direct investment made into Japanese companies' operations in the United States, say Toyota (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM\" title=\"Toyota Motor Corporation\">TM</a>) or Honda (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMC\" title=\"Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\">HMC</a>). The timeline for this is currently unclear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably here, President Trump told Prime Minister Takaichi that the U.S. is \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/world/asia/trump-asia-photos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/world/asia/trump-asia-photos.html\" target=\"_blank\">an ally at the strongest level,</a>\" and to call him if there is \"anything I can do to help Japan.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It remains to be seen what this means in practice, but a lowering of Japanese tariffs was certainly a good start. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803653-us-japan-trade-deal-mission-accomplished\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803653-us-japan-trade-deal-mission-accomplished\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese car manufacturers have been eating the tariffs</a> outright since they were announced, likely hoping for an outcome like this that allows them to recover some profit margin without having raised prices on consumers.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korea Makes a Deal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seoul also had their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-korea-trade-deal-revives-concerns-about-currency-flight-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-korea-trade-deal-revives-concerns-about-currency-flight-2025-10-30/\" target=\"_blank\">tariffs drop from 25% to 15%</a>, and they agreed to invest $350 billion into the US. The details here were about as sparse as those in Japan, as one can expect when deals are announced in a flurry like this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of liquidity concerns with the Won, there were deals made to split the investments up into installments, capped at $20B/year.

Specifically, the Chinese rare earth restrictions are being discussed, as well as American AI chip restrictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We get gallium and graphite; they get NVIDIA's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The truce lasting for one year is problematic because it's just kicking the can down the road, but it allows for the economy to continue in its current shape while we work towards independence in these areas. Without China, there is no American economy that works the way that it currently does. We just import too many important things, specifically magnets and rare earths.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can't just cut them out and say we don't want the rare earths. We need them to keep economic activity at the level it currently is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why the other trade deals surrounding the meeting with China were so important. Making a trade truce doesn't solve our problem. We still don't have the gallium and graphite long-term, but in the short term, while we build out those deals with allies, we can keep this supply from China coming in smoothly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whether you agree with this strategy or not is different from whether it's being implemented. It is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The news saw both American and Chinese markets sell off, but the US rebounded, while Chinese markets continued to erase gains made the past week of the tour following the announcement of the truce.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Change in Tone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was also interesting surrounding this were the leaders' comments about each other, where they discussed each other as peers and rivals depending on who they were speaking to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It reminds me of when China began to join the WTO and ascended to the world stage in the 1990s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In May 1993,<a href=\"https://china.usc.edu/node/19959\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"https://china.usc.edu/node/19959\" target=\"_blank\"> President Bill Clinton said</a>: \"We are prepared to build a more cooperative relationship with China and wish to work with China as an active member of the international community.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July 1993, <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3oFtynW4AAwnkh?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3oFtynW4AAwnkh?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" target=\"_blank\">President Jiang Zemin said</a>: \"For the foreseeable future, the United States will remain our primary adversary...\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To those that were watching closely, it was a clear sign of an asymmetry in our relationship. That's the same asymmetry that Trump is trying to address now, 30 years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That asymmetry is gone now, as both leaders talk openly about being both peers and rivals, not just one or the other. It was clear that neither side felt like they secured the win they wanted, which is standard in negotiating, but is not how anyone wants their negotiations to end. For now, we have a truce, while we build independence and work with our allies to create a strategic supply chain that doesn't include a country that considers us its primary adversary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That quote is from 1993, but if you had told me President Xi said it following this meeting, I would believe you. So would most analysts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, there is an impetus for the United States to secure itself strategically. That includes securing strong relationships with our partners and containing our adversaries, both militarily and economically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view of the situation is still that rare-earth firms continue to benefit despite the trade truce, which saw a sell-off in some rare-earth stocks. The overall macro situation for them remains mostly unchanged; it is overwhelmingly bullish from my view. The US and its allies need to secure these supply chains, regardless of how long they have access to them via China. Relying on China just isn't sustainable long-term, and so the investment into these firms will likely continue at full speed once the government re-opens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of the foreign investment promised out of Japan and South Korea will go to strategic supply chains as well, like shipbuilding and domestic manufacturing. This will take time, and it is unclear what the full road of investment looks like. I am eager for more details.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FORM\" title=\"FormFactor, Inc.\">FORM</a></span>) reported very positive numbers, which sent its shares over 24% for the day, on the back of improved operational performance and a return to growth in sequential sales. I wanted to take a look at the numbers in more<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> detail and give some comments on the outlook and why I am not particularly itching to start a position.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806987-formfactor-q2-earnings-the-future-looks-much-better-if-everything-goes-well\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806987-formfactor-q2-earnings-the-future-looks-much-better-if-everything-goes-well\" target=\"_blank\">Since the last time</a> I covered the company, it has done tremendously as its share price doubled in just three months. I said that the future looks very good, but I held off from giving it a buy rating as I had some reservations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>By The Numbers</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting from the top, sales topped $202.6m, down 2.6% y/y, but slightly beat analysts’ estimates by $2.6m. DRAM probe cards grew double-digits and were the main contributor to the performance that could have been much worse. The systems segment also experienced growth due to higher initial volume production of co-packaged optics. The company began to see some sequential growth, which is good to see. Looking at the breakdown of sales in a bit more detail, we can see that DRAM sales were clearly the best performer this quarter, while Foundry &amp; Logic saw some softness within the Probe Cards Segment.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2032\" data-height=\"1060\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FORM IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FORM IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of regional breakdown, South Korea seems to be the standout in terms of demand for the company’s products, while China is starting to show some action and is slowly coming back up.

Q3 Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.33, beating consensus by $0.08. A decent margin. The company’s GAAP margins saw a particularly strong improvement of around 250bps sequentially to almost 40%, while non-GAAP GM came in at 41%. These improvements can be attributed to overall operational efficiencies, cost controls, and labor reductions. The company’s non-GAAP operating margins improved significantly since Q2’25 by around 270bps, leading to the net income increase to $15.66m from $9.09m in Q2, while non-GAAP bottom line came in at $25.68m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the company’s financial situation, FORM finished the quarter with around $97.6m in cash and equivalents, as well as $168.3m in marketable securities, against $11m in long-term debt. That is essentially no debt, since the company’s liquidity far outweighs the obligations on debt. The company’s balance sheet continues to improve, and I don’t see anything wrong with it. It’s quite strong. The company is flush with cash and will no doubt easily survive any major downturns in the economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these results, management was kind enough to provide us with some updated numbers for the next quarter. The management now expects to make around $210m in sales, which comes in above the estimates of $199.6m, while adjusted EPS should be around $0.35, which is also well above consensus estimates of $0.29, with gross margin forecasted to reach 42%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"857\" data-height=\"75\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FORM 8K\" width=\"640\" height=\"56\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FORM 8K</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the results were decent. Sales are beginning to pick up, while the company’s operations have improved significantly in just one quarter. On top of that, the company raised guidance for the rest of the year, coupled with a beat on top and bottom lines, investors sent the company’s shares up over 24% for the day. I think this sort of reaction was a bit too much. Sure, the operational improvements are nice, but top-line growth was still non-existent y/y, but my best guess is that due to a decent sequential improvement, investors believe the company is ready to return to growth. Also, I believe investors are very positive about the company’s DRAM and HBM performance, which are critical for AI. Some analysts raised the company’s price target significantly following the results, due to improved margins, assigning a PT of $44 from $23. A massive bump, which no doubt helped fuel this rally. The PT is still much lower than what the company trades at, but such a boost is telling.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comments On The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has been doing a tremendous job of getting the company’s efficiency and profitability to where they used to be just one year ago, and I believe those numbers will be improved upon over the next few quarters, especially if the demand for everything AI-related continues the way it has. And I am very certain that this AI hype is not going anywhere for at least another few years. The reason I think so is because the main players in the AI/data center space have all reported their earnings over the last two days, and all of which have not only raised their capex spend from previous estimates for the rest of the year, but also provided not-so-cryptic messaging about the next year’s capex to be significantly higher than 2025’s. So, this means there is going to be a lot of money thrown around still in this AI race, and this only means that companies that have anything to do with AI and data centers will see some sort of a boost for much longer. The stock has already more than doubled since the lows in April, and with the recent results and guidance numbers, investors expect this growth to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More demand means fixed cost per unit can be spread out more efficiently, leading to higher margins overall, as long as pricing remains stable or decreases. Hype trends like AI are going to continue to drive demand for the company’s products; it’s just a matter of the company actually capturing more of that demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company may not see a lot of growth right now, even if hyperscalers are shoveling billions of dollars into AI. However, due to longer lead times and being somewhat of a specialized semiconductor testing company, I expect growth to come in eventually, which is why, I believe, is the reason we saw such a jump in share price <span>on October 30</span>. Investors are already pricing it in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Closing Comments</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, I am going to maintain my hold rating, as I believe the growth has been more or less priced in after this massive jump in share price today. I can see the management is doing a great thing regarding improved efficiency and profitability; however, such a jump in price can only mean that the future improvements have been accounted for by investors. Unless the company surprises us even more over the next few quarters, like showing a 50% growth in sales. That would be impressive and would warrant having another look at it in a lot more detail.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, my exposure to everything AI is already too high; therefore, I am going to sit this one out.</p>",

Although revenue disappointed relative to even that pretty low bar, the overall results showed an improving margin on just slightly growing sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results reported for the third quarter indicate that Verizon is becoming more profitable over time, and indeed, that is the long-term trend as well. In the table below, you can see that since year-end 2021, VZ’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/income-statement\">gross profit </a>has increased from $77.3 billion to $81.49 billion, while its revenue has increased from $133.6 billion to $137 billion. This indicates that the company’s gross profit margin has increased from 57.8% to 59.4%—a non-negligible increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Verizon gross profit growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"568\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Verizon gross profit growth <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we have a considerable increase in Verizon’s gross profit, as well as its gross profit margin, yet VZ stock is actually down 30% over a five-year period.

According to Seeking Alpha Quant, VZ trades at a mere 8.3 times earnings, contributing to an A- valuation rating. This combined with increasing revenue and gross margins would appear to indicate cheapness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, none of the above means anything if Verizon is destined to have its financial fortunes crumble tomorrow. We always need to attempt to gauge a company’s forward prospects before saying that it is truly cheap. I’ll explore that matter in detail in a later section. For now, I will simply point to the fact that the company has $383 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/balance-sheet\">assets</a>–only 5.9% of which are goodwill–and $3.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is a treasure chest the company can draw on to outlast competitors in times of stress and which can be used to make new investments. These simple facts bode well for Verizon’s future prospects–though obviously we need to look at much more than just balance sheet health before we can fully render a verdict on the matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing investors will want to know about Verizon stock following its third quarter release is its suitability as a dividend stock. Before VZ’s earnings came out, the company had a healthy payout ratio, with Seeking Alpha Quant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/dividends/scorecard\">confirming it at 57.6%</a> for the trailing 12-month period. With VZ having posted positive earnings growth in the third quarter, that ratio is presumably coming down over time. So, VZ’s 7%-yielding dividend is getting better covered by earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1182\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ dividend summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">VZ dividend summary <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered Verizon stock, I rated it a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4652210-verizon-stands-to-gain-from-falling-inflation\">Buy</a> because of the improvements I saw in its operations. Since then, the company has grown and increased its profitability, while its stock has decreased in price. The underlying value would appear to be greater now. So, I am increasing my rating to Strong Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verizon’s recent <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-3q-2025-earnings-reiterates-full-year-financial-guidance\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings release</a> mostly exceeded analyst expectations, boasting the following metrics:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$33.8 billion in revenue, up 1.6% year over year (miss by $400 million).</p></li> <li><p>$1.17 in reported EPS, up 50%.</p></li> <li><p>$1.21 in adjusted EPS, up 1.6% (beat by $0.02).</p></li> <li><p>$28 billion in nine-month operating cash flow, up 5.6%.</p></li> <li><p>$15.8 billion in nine-month free cash flow (FCF), up 8.9%.</p></li> <li><p>$12.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, up 2.4%.</p></li> <li><p>$21 billion in wireless service revenue, up 2.1%.</p></li> <li><p>$5.6 billion in wireless equipment revenue, up 5.2%.</p></li> <li><p>261,000 wireless net additions.</p></li> <li><p>306,000 broadband net additions.</p></li> <li><p>Guidance for 1% to 3% EPS growth.</p></li> <li><p>Guidance for $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion in full-year FCF.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the headline metrics were all pretty satisfactory. Additionally, there were some nice tidbits of information away in the release as well, for example:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>There were 61,000 internet net additions in the quarter, the best result seen in two years.</p></li> <li><p>Postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA) improved 2%.</p></li> <li><p>The company had 13.2 million total broadband customers by the end of the quarter.</p></li> <li><p>It also delivered a $6.7 billion reduction in net debt.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These additional facts go to show that Verizon is not only beating earnings expectations but also improving its financial condition as well as customer totals. It looks like a pretty good picture.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future Prospects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having looked at VZ’s most recent periodic performance, we can now attempt to gauge its future prospects. I already touched on this in the introduction, when I wrote that the company has a lot of assets and cash with which to invest. That is one competitive edge that could drive future growth for VZ. Another, less measurable (but still important) edge the company has is a strong focus on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-boosts-annual-forecast-demand-premium-plans-tax-law-benefit-2025-07-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">premium plans</a>. While telcos in general don’t enjoy much <a href=\"https://www.iotinsider.com/iot-insights/technical-insights/the-true-cost-of-falling-telecoms-prices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pricing power</a>, with service prices declining long-term, there are segments of the telco market where suppliers have more power. One of those is the “ultra high speed” segment, where unlimited 5G plans can often come at a significant cost to consumers. Customers are often willing to pay up for such plans. This is particularly the case with customers who <em>need</em> constant high-speed internet, such as gamers and business owners. Verizon is investing heavily in servicing such consumers, buying up fibre optic companies to help serve them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next up, we can look at the multiples that Verizon trades at. At today’s price, VZ is a pretty cheap-looking stock, trading at 8.3 times earnings, 1.2 times sales, and 1.56 times book. You can see more multiples in the image below, courtesy of Seeking Alpha Quant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1048\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"757\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">VZ valuation <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One multiple that looks very intriguing here is the PEG ratio, which indicates truly extreme cheapness after factoring in growth. I don’t think that VZ’s earnings growth rate is going to remain at 103% forever–the company doesn’t have the top-line growth to support that–but it should be positive. So, I expect VZ to continue having a respectable PEG ratio, unless its price rises dramatically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for what VZ is worth in terms of discounted cash flows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I found from Capital IQ data that analysts estimate VZ’s cost of equity at 7% and its long-term earnings growth rate at 1.3%. Using these estimates as well as Seeking Alpha Quant’s estimate of VZ’s FCF per share, I got a $85.79 fair value estimate.

These include:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Competition.</strong> There are many telcos in the United States, and some, such as AT&amp;T Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) are quite strong and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T/balance-sheet\">well funded</a>. They could bring competition to Verizon that puts pressure on its margins.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Little pricing power.</strong> Verizon does not appear to have much pricing power, as evidenced by the fact that it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-posts-higher-subscriber-loss-price-hikes-competition-2025-04-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">experienced subscriber loss</a> when it attempted to hike prices earlier this year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>High costs.</strong> Telco services are capital-intensive owing to the fact that they run on large amounts of heavy infrastructure. This typically requires them to borrow lots of money, although Verizon has been paying down its debt in recent quarters.</p></li> </ol> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above risks are worth keeping in mind. However, Verizon’s cheapness more than adequately compensates for them, making the company's stock a buy in my books.</p>",

But there are other factors to consider as well. As an example, I usually give additional wiggle room to high-quality companies with industry-leading positions. And if those businesses are growing at a nice pace, I give even more wiggle room. A great example of this that, recently, has fallen a bit short, is none other than the appropriately named Waste Management (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WM\" title=\"Waste Management, Inc.\">WM</a>). Since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4763847-waste-management-still-offers-upside-as-cash-flows-are-slated-to-grow-rapidly\">I reaffirmed the company</a> as a ‘buy’ candidate in early March of this year, the S&amp;P 500 has shot up 13%. But over that same time, shares of the company have dropped 6.6%. This is disheartening to say the least. But honestly, all this does, in my view, is open up a door for additional purchases for those who are inclined to do so.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is that Waste Management has achieved strong growth recently. And in all likelihood, that growth will continue for the foreseeable future. In fact, for the upcoming earnings release covering the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, which management is supposed to announce on October 28th before the market opens, revenue and profits are both expected to rise. It is true that shares are not as cheap as I would like them to be. But compared to other major players in the market, the stock is certainly affordable. So unless some major negative event comes out of the woodwork, I will almost certainly maintain my ‘buy’ rating on the stock.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833456-waste-management-downturn-doesnt-justify-sitting-in-waste-bin\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832961-pagaya-technologies-the-ai-credit-platform-turning-data-into-durable-profits\">Pagaya Technologies: The AI Credit Platform Turning Data Into Durable Profits</a></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/pau-galindo-ortigosa\">Pau Galindo Ortigosa</a> | <em>Strong Buy</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Pagaya Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGY\" title=\"Pagaya Technologies Ltd.\">PGY</a>) stock reached a new high of $44.99 on September 19, 2025.

The Canadian Natural Resources Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNQ\" title=\"Canadian Natural Resources Limited\">CNQ</a>) is the largest producer of Canadian oil, with high financial stability and potential for further scaling of export activities. With CNQ's per-barrel production costs significantly lower than those of its main industry competitors in North America, it has the guarantee of maintaining positive financial results during a downturn in the oil market.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/bessent-u-s-to-impose-substantial-sanctions-on-russia-84132054?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=2&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">new sanctions</a> against Russia's oil industry could potentially halt Russian oil supplies to China and India. If the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline is fully utilized, Canadian Natural Resources could increase its oil supplies by concluding new agreements with Chinese oil refineries. Moreover, for oil prices, the new sanctions against Russian oil companies are an additional factor that, if not raising the cost of hydrocarbons, then at least halting its decline in the short and medium term.</p> <p>Considering CNQ's positive outlook and competitive advantages, I recommend these shares as a \"Buy.\" In this article, I will reveal more detailed information about the reasons behind my decision. That said, I am not an active supporter of the bullish camp when it comes to oil companies. For instance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830223-civitas-resources-potential-merger-with-sm-energy-may-lead-to-a-stock-decline\">my latest fundamental analysis</a> of the oil company Civitas Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIVI\" title=\"Civitas Resources, Inc.\">CIVI</a>) resulted in a \"Sell\" recommendation.

One of the stocks riding this AI bandwagon has been Power Solutions International, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSIX\" title=\"Power Solutions International, Inc.\">PSIX</a>), which has surged 20-fold in a matter of ~two years. The meteoric rise of PSIX has been driven by its timely pivot toward catering to AI data center-related demand as opposed to its legacy business catering to the industrial and transportation sector.</p> <p>I believe the demand related to data centers continues to be robust, with hyperscalers and other cloud providers either setting up or pledging to set up multi-gigawatt-scale data centers. While PSIX should benefit from this tailwind, I believe its unique position as a lesser-established player in the industry makes it vulnerable as the competitive industry brews up and customers switch back to more established players. Furthermore, a significant stake sale by an insider further makes me cautious about PSIX's prospects.</p> <p>While my outlook is quite cautious on the stock, I am refraining from issuing a sell rating, particularly due to good fundamental momentum in the data center space. I would like to wait for a confirmation sign that competitive intensity is growing and materially affecting PSIX’s numbers, particularly margins. Until then, I would be sitting on the sidelines with a hold (neutral) rating on the stock.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834744-the-ai-hype-could-end-early-for-power-solutions-international\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833118-nuscale-danger-signs-on-meltdown-of-speculative-froth\">NuScale: Danger Signs On Meltdown Of Speculative Froth</a></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/jr-research\">JR Research</a> | <em>Hold</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>I've never been that interested in investing in energy companies, let alone companies that specialize in nuclear energy technology like NuScale Power Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMR\" title=\"NuScale Power Corporation\">SMR</a>). However, 2025 has been a real eye-opener even to a seasoned investor and market watcher that I consider myself to be, as the stock of money-losing companies has continued its rampaging run. That said, I'm not particularly perturbed about missing \"big speculative opportunities\" if they aren't backed by solid fundamentals.</p> <p>Also, I'm not especially keen on scooping up so-called \"undervalued\" plays in the fundamentally/structurally challenged sectors of the market (like the oil and gas peers, some healthcare plays, etc.). Investors who position the majority of their portfolios in these sectors have arguably missed out on partaking in the advance impelled by the tech and Mag 7 stocks as they demonstrate their AI prowess while also continuing to build their clout in this fourth industrial AI revolution.</p> <p>I brought up the issue of speculative opportunities earlier because I believe SMR stock falls right into such a setup. It's not a coincidence that SMR is also the acronym for \"small modular reactor\" as much as it refers specifically to the ticker symbol for <a href=\"https://www.nuscalepower.com/hubfs/Website/Investors/Investor-Presentation.pdf?hsLang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">NuScale Power</a>. What's critical for investors to note is that the company has consistently positioned itself as a key technology enabler or provider, encompassing its burgeoning partnership with ENTRA1, while also relying on Doosan as its key manufacturing partner. The reportedly asset-light approach is designed to help <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810761-nuscale-power-corporation-smr-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">NuScale potentially avoid the CapEx</a> complexities and financing challenges entailed with being a developer while also benefiting from the manufacturing expertise of a trusted supply chain partner.</p> <p>Yet, the drawback suggests that it's imperative for NuScale to manage the supply chain dynamics extremely well in this early stage of the SMR buildout, even though it has obtained NRC approval. In addition, I believe we must also be cognizant of the challenges that encompass the multi-year rollout of NuScale's ability to scale, given the investments it has made in long-lead materials this year to pave the runway for a 2030 commercial operation date status, which is pivotal to justifying the extremely frothy valuation metrics that complement its investment thesis right now.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833118-nuscale-danger-signs-on-meltdown-of-speculative-froth\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835217-droneshield-stock-potential-for-exponential-revenue-growth\">DroneShield: Potential For Exponential Revenue Growth</a></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/stephen-tobin\">Stephen Tobin</a> | <em>Strong Buy</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>DroneShield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRSHF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"DroneShield Limited\">OTCPK:DRSHF</a>) is an Australian company that manufactures counter-drone systems.

They say it's wise to take a safe position while the music’s still playing and the lights are on. And even if the party lasts longer than expected, it's always smart to have some, maybe not the front-line growers, but great value stocks in your portfolio.</p> <p>In my opinion, one area worth exploring for relatively safe plays is the category of so-called “fallen angels” — solid leaders with well-established businesses that are currently facing turbulence. However, if the issues seem to be rather temporary ones, the business model isn’t broken, the financials remain within a credible range, and competitive management is in place, then these companies could be well-positioned for recovery.</p> <p>Easy to say, hard to find — at least in my experience. Still, I carved out some dedicated time and started digging and ended up with two companies I think are worth a closer look. One of them, which I started reviewing last week, had an earnings release just around the corner, offers an 11% dividend, runs a somewhat old-fashioned and sluggish — but definitely not broken — business, has strong financials, and has a solid story that suggests stability, maybe even some growth ahead. If there’s interest, one could <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833210-western-union-stock-value-opportunity-with-a-secure-dividend\">check it out here.</a></p> <p>The other one that fell within my criteria was United Parcel Service, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPS\" title=\"United Parcel Service, Inc.\">UPS</a>). That’s where I’m reminded of an old Warren Buffett saying: it’s better to invest in a business you understand. It wasn’t exactly phrased like that word-for-word, but the broader meaning holds true to me. And I think, broadly and simply put, delivering packages around the world and right to the doorstep is a business most people can grasp more easily than, say, quantum computing. A 7.5% dividend yield is very attractive, and a forward-looking P/E of 13.5 made me want to dig deeper to see if I’m not missing a great opportunity here.</p> <p>Having done the analysis, I rate UPS as a Buy. In my view, the current struggles are fixable, and the likelihood of a successful turnaround is relatively high. Even if finding firmer footing takes time, the dividend looks sustainable for now — unless something truly extraordinary happens.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834081-ups-back-on-track-cash-flow-supports-dividend\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Now, the leader in terms of AUM on the market is the <span class=\"cf0\">Alerian</span><span class=\"cf0 paywall-full-content\"> MLP ETF</span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (AMLP), and in some ways, I understand the enthusiasm.

Yet its investment strategy is very simple: it’s a passive ETF with the Alerian MLP Index (float-adjusted, cap-weighted) as its benchmark and an expense ratio of 0.85%. So the core remains U.S. energy MLPs (oil &amp; gas pipelines), with a specific focus on the <a href=\"https://www.alpsfunds.com/hubfs/alps-docs/lit/fs/alerian-mlp-etf-amlp-fs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">midstream energy</a> segment (transport &amp; storage).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"258\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP: profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"212\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP: profile <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1) Holding distribution: high concentration.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A first element to discuss is certainly the holding distribution.

And I had already stated that MLPX would in my opinion be a more competitive pick in this segment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797987-among-mlps-mlpx-is-the-most-promising-candidate-going-forward\">read here</a>). What I personally appreciate, and I recognize it may be debatable, is the presence of a structural mix that goes beyond AMLP’s concentration. In MLPX, for example, there are holdings both of midstream MLPs and energy infrastructure corporations, which is why the holding distribution broadens and total performance increases. An element that, in my opinion, is further amplified in ENFR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"803\" data-height=\"193\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP - MLPA - MLPX - ENFR: Concentration &amp; Risk\" width=\"640\" height=\"154\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP - MLPA - MLPX - ENFR: Concentration &amp; Risk <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is it so attractive?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll get straight to the point, the reason why this sector is chosen, despite a capital loss of about 37% since 2010, is in my opinion the high yield element, which today is very competitive, equal to 8.3% distributed quarterly;</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP: Dividend Grade\" width=\"640\" height=\"275\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP: Dividend Grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And it’s, in my opinion, an expression of <a href=\"https://www.alpsfunds.com/hubfs/alps-docs/lit/insight/alerian-mlp-etf-amlp-insights-20250930.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the genuineness</a> of the MLP segment in general (not just AMLP): not by chance there’s a good coverage ratio of the distribution, between 45% – 70%.

So, these considerations should not be considered exhaustive: they only reflect my personal reflection and experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But a good chapter could be opened in this sense. This is because <a href=\"https://www.alpsfunds.com/viewer?&amp;id=53158024758\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMLP is not a RIC</a>, therefore it has deferred tax liabilities theoretically positive. In this sense, the benefit of the MLPs is lost and in my personal opinion this is the reason why there is an evident divergence in performance compared to the reference index. Discussing it with other bank advisor colleagues, it seems that often the “tax simplicity” is preferred to the “convenience,” and on this I have no doubts. For this reason it is a very subjective reasoning, and I only bring you my opinion. But I repeat: personally, this leads me even more to prefer MLP stock picking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NB: moving to the side of share distribution; it is always over 70% ROC, an element that as you know instead is associated with tax benefits (reduces the tax basis of the shares).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4) Catalysts? Which ones?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Behind the rebound of the segment there are certainly many interesting narratives. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797987-among-mlps-mlpx-is-the-most-promising-candidate-going-forward\">In my opinion</a>, the prevailing one is the boom in demand coming from AI/data centers build-out. Contextualizing more based on the recent news of these weeks, there seem to be 2 other potential positive catalysts: the new U.S. sanctions against Russia but also the Fed rate cuts. This generates primarily positive pressure on the price of oil, and secondly, a potential boost for the commodities segment (because industrial expectations increase). If we add to this the pullback of about 10% since April 2025, it seems like a real opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, some clarifications are needed.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk of AMLP, shared also by its peers and by individual MLPs, is that they are linked to oil production. But attention, here a not insignificant disconnection is created in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When expectations related to oil production decline, MLPs price in a potential negative cycle in their fundamentals. But this does not make AMLP an “oil price beta” ETF. And we can see the divergence in the positive tail of the return distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP - OILK: price return\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP - OILK: price return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a fundamental level what happens?

This is why since 2022 this sector has held up well through the economic cyclical rotation. Secondly, the intentions confirmed by OPEC to increase production, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-leaning-towards-another-small-oil-output-increase-sources-say-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">not reduce it</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the MLP segment can truly help diversify the portfolio’s income sources and provide good capital preservation. On AMLP, although it is a leader in the sector, I find some weaknesses I couldn’t overlook. Considering the strong concentration, the tax burden, the presence of more competitive peers, and ultimately the lack of a clear short-term catalyst, I think the right rating for AMLP is Hold.</p>",

(NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VALE\" class=\"ticker-link\">VALE</a>) is a producer and miner of minerals for various commercial production purposes, primarily iron ore, but also nickel and copper, due to the structure of its mines and deposits in its portfolio. Its business is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> primarily focused on Latin America, especially Brazil, but it also owns and manages deposits in North America and Asia. Iron ore is undoubtedly Vale's main product. It represents a total of 84 million tons of production, compared to 40,000 tons of nickel and 93,000 tons of copper.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past year, the company has experienced a decline in revenue due to a fall in the international price of iron ore. This decline began rapidly in 2022 but has continued since January 2024, where it had last recovered. This trend is closely linked to the slowdown in Chinese economic growth. It is important to understand this concept because the Asian giant currently accounts for more than 50% of global steel production, the main raw material of which is iron ore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1915\" data-height=\"953\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ironore\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Trading Economics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, as I will try to describe in this report, especially in the following thesis segment, the characteristics of VALE as a company and the potential it has in the short and medium term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously mentioned, VALE maintains a stake in Latin America, North America, and Asia.

In this sense, the Asian giant represents one of the main demanders of this commodity, based on the fact that the country is the world's leading steel producer. Therefore, understanding China's performance in the short term is key to the future of the international price of iron ore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the question arises as to what could happen in the medium and long term. In this sense, it is necessary to understand the growth in demand that other countries and regions may experience. As can be seen below, VALE expects that, on the iron ore demand side, China will continue to show a downward trend in the medium term. However, the trend is expected to increase, driven by greater participation from India and other countries outside the main demanders at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w640\" alt=\"demanda\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"433\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 results presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding these forecasts, from my perspective, it's important to note that the expectation for India's growth is well-founded. According to some specialized websites, <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/steel-demand-in-india-set-to-grow-9-in-2025-2026/articleshow/124532216.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"nofollow\">steel production in India is expected to grow by approximately 9%</a> in the short term. Regarding the company's forecasts for China and its demand for iron ore, they appear to be rather conservative. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-ravenous-appetite-iron-ore-remains-steel-output-slips-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Much of the market expects demand for this mineral</a> from the Asian giant to remain strong, which could offer a better short-term outlook than the company anticipates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to the iron ore supply, as long as international prices remain stable, VALE expects a significant portion of iron ore mines to return to profitability, leading to a recovery in production from there. However, they estimate that even then, they will not be able to cope with even more significant demand growth by 2030. These highlights price pressure that could be beneficial for the industry. This could not only lead to a recovery in the company's margins, but also, given the increase in production that VALE is expected to drive, a significant increase in revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w640\" alt=\"oferta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"517\" height=\"341\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 results presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this regard, the year 2025 represented a significant increase compared to 2024 in terms of copper and nickel tonnage. While it's true that the increase in iron ore was a smaller percentage, it grew by around 3.7% compared to 2024. Considering the volumes this metal represents in VALE's total production, we see that, from my perspective, an increase of this magnitude is interesting and attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"912\" data-height=\"376\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"producción de VALE\" width=\"640\" height=\"264\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 results presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead and toward margin recovery, it's interesting to see the company's achievements in reducing or controlling costs.

First, I want to focus on production changes, and then move on to the financial results. In this regard, Vale's total iron ore production during the second quarter of 2025 was 77.35 million metric tons. This figure, compared to the 79.79 million metric tons produced in the second quarter of 2024, represents a decrease of approximately 3%. Furthermore, compared to the first quarter of 2024, production grew 17% compared to the 66.14 million metric tons produced in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the international price of iron ore, the downward trend mentioned in the thesis segment can be seen. As can be seen, Vale's realized price of the commodity in 2Q2025 was $97.8/ton, while in 1Q2025 it was $103.6/ton, representing a drop of approximately 6%. Compared to 2Q2024, the drop was approximately 13% compared to the $111.8/ton reported by the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would now like to analyze the main financial results reported by VALE. Regarding revenues, the company reported a result of $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2025. This represented an 11% decrease compared to the $9.9 billion for the same period in 2024. However, when we analyze it compared to the first quarter of 2025 figures, we see an 8% increase compared to the $8.12 billion for that period. This continues to reflect the trend described at the beginning of this section.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1103\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"resultados\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now analyze the company's reported EBITDA figures. VALE reported a total of $3,386 million in 2Q2025. Again, compared to the figures reported in 2Q2024, we see a 15% drop compared to the $3,993 million reported in that period. Again, compared to 1Q2025, we see an increase of approximately 9% compared to the $3,115 million reported in that quarter. It's interesting to analyze the EV/EBITDA ratio. Annualizing the previously described figures, we can calculate a ratio of approximately 4.99x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"904\" data-height=\"359\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 Results Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another interesting point was the quarter-over-quarter decline in CapEx and compared to last year. In Q2 2025, the company's reported CapEx was $1,053 million, a 10% decrease compared to the $1,173 million reported in Q1 2025. The decline is even greater compared to Q2 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Valuation</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this segment, I developed a DCF model, in order to further contribute to the description of the company and the scenario in which it operates, in light of what can be expected. In this regard, I first describe the assumptions I used to perform the calculations. Regarding the tax rate, I used 18%. While it may seem low compared to other industries, when examining the effective rate in Seeking Alpha's Financials segment, according to the data reported by the company, it can be seen that the average for recent years is below that value. I deliberately decided to perform the calculations with a higher rate to generate a margin of safety in the company's valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the perpetual growth rate, I decided to use a value of 2%, which is slightly below global GDP growth in recent decades, a value to which the demand for steel, and therefore for iron ore, is closely linked. Again, the idea behind this selection was to maintain a margin of safety in relation to the company's final valuation. Regarding the WACC, I would like to explain in a little more detail why I believe a value of 10% contributes more to that margin of safety. First, when analyzing the capital structure, we can see that Vale has a market capitalization of $45.67 billion and a debt stock of $20.39 billion. This generates a debt and equity-to-total assets ratio of 30.9% and 69.1%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the cost of debt, <a href=\"https://es.tradingview.com/symbols/BMFBOVESPA-VALE3/bonds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the volume-weighted average of bonds</a> issued gives the company a yield of around 5.34%. In this sense, a WACC of 10% would imply a cost of equity of 12.08%, which, considering the company's <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VALE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta of approximately 1.02</a>, seems reasonable, even considering that the company's primary business is in emerging countries. In fact, when we look at specialized sites, we can see that the WACC they assign to the company is <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/VALE\" rel=\"nofollow\">around 6.5%,</a> considerably lower than the one I decided to choose. This is undoubtedly where I tried to be more conservative, charging a penalty precisely because of the risks inherent in the countries in which Vale operates, but also as confirmation of the generation of the safety margin I've been mentioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding EBITDA growth, I proposed a 5% increase for the first year, 4.5% for the second, 4% for the third, 3% for the fourth, and 2.5% for the fifth, aligning with the same growth rate in perpetuity thereafter. While this may seem like a high-growth rate, as can be seen in the table below, market analysts' forecasts indicate an EPS of $1.81, while the value for 2024 was $1.42. Considering this increase, it can be seen that a 5% increase in EBITDA is quite conservative. Regarding amortization and depreciation, to simplify the calculations, I assumed they would grow at a rate equal to that of EBITDA. Finally, regarding CapEx, I estimated a constant growth of 1.5% throughout the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1220\" data-height=\"160\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPS\" width=\"640\" height=\"84\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Earnings Segment</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, taking all these assumptions into consideration, it can be seen that the company has attractive upside potential. It's important to note that this value is obtained even under the conservative assumptions that sought to generate a margin of safety. From my perspective, these results reinforce the scenario and forecasts detailed in the thesis segment and provide further justification for the BUY rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"694\" data-height=\"530\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF2\" width=\"640\" height=\"489\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Financials &amp; my own estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks And Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I would like to mention the main risks that may be looming in the short term. Without a doubt, the most important to note, from my perspective, is the change in foreign trade policy undertaken by the United States government. The White House's initiative to increase import tariffs on the vast majority of countries has China as one of the main targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the impact this Asian country represents on steel production and iron ore demand, the escalation of the situation could be a major risk. While it is true that other players are expected to drive demand in the medium term, the fact that Chinese economic growth does not recover or, worse still, declines as a result of a trade war with the United States, could affect the transition period and generate a further downward trend in iron ore prices in the short term.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, due to the geographic location of VALE's business, I believe the Brazilian company is better positioned than some other competitors to address the risks. Given the scenario I sought and the company's valuation, I believe VALE has good growth prospects and can benefit greatly from a change in the cycle. At the same time, it has the qualities to withstand a continuation of the trend experienced by iron ore in recent years. Therefore, I consider the company a BUY.</p>",

Any transshipment from third countries faces a 40% duty. Still, Vietnam will improve market access by resolving constraints that U.S. exports face. For example, it would recognize vehicles that meet U.S. safety and emission standards. Vietnam would simplify regulatory approvals for U.S. pharmaceutical products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vietnam Airlines signed a deal to buy 50 Boeing aircraft worth $8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To get an idea of Vietnam’s market size, look at the <a href=\"https://www.vietnamexportdata.com/blogs/vietnam-imports-data-2025-top-importers-import-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\">$379 billion imports in 2024</a>.

This freezes the 50% BIS (Bureau of Industry and Security) rule. The rule would have extended last year’s announced export-licensing requirements.

The U.S. and China paused tariffs and restrictions, respectively, for one year. They will continue to play their long game using short-term agreements in principle. Investors will need to exercise caution in holding companies that struggled before tariffs. For example, Newell Brands Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWL\" title=\"Newell Brands Inc.\">NWL</a>) lost 32% despite indicating the impact of tariffs <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4512350-newell-brands-outlines-2026-innovation-push-and-expects-operating-cash-flow-to-strengthen\">subsiding in 2026</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China is not faring well economically. Weaker exports, hurt by U.S. tariffs, resulted in factory activity falling to a six-month low.

Investors would not likely notice the weak data. FXI stock is up by 25% in the last year. The country’s technology stocks are up, too. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) gained 98.8% and Tencent Holdings Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>) is up by 51.8% YTD. Technology investors need not worry about the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510996-trump-says-no-discussion-with-xi-on-nvidia-blackwell-chip-sales-to-china\">absence of discussing</a> NVIDIA Corporation's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell chip sales to China.
