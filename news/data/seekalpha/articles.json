Revenue was up 85% from last year, but all year-over-year comparisons are heavily distorted by its acquisition of the First of Long Island. Q3 represents the first full quarter of FLIC being a part of CNOB. Adjusted earnings excluded $0.08 of favorable one-time items, namely a $6.6 million benefit from an employee retention tax credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bank’s return on tangible equity accelerated nicely to 12.6% from 9.3% last quarter and 7% a year ago. A key driver of the FLIC purchase was to improve CNOB’s funding mix and enhance scale in order to drive better returns for investors. I view it as essential for a bank to earn an ROE of at least 10% to show it is meeting its cost of capital. In Q3, CNOB achieved this. We will need to see this sustained, and that in turn can help support a valuation more clearly in excess of book value. I believe it will be sustained.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet mix is better post-FLIC</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to its balance sheet, client deposits rose by about 1% sequentially and sit at $11.4 billion, up from $7.8 billion last year. While total deposits are up about 45%, noninterest-bearing balances are up over 75% to $2.5 billion. They now account for over 20% of deposits. This is not an unusually high share; rather, legacy CNOB had relatively low NIB balances. These balances are especially valuable in an elevated interest rate environment, and their presence on the balance sheet is helping to improve margins. Interest-bearing deposit costs declined to 3.31%, down 4bps sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loans grew by about 1.2% from Q2 to $11.3 billion. This, of course, was up dramatically from last year’s $8.3 billion, given the FLIC purchase. CNOB’s loan portfolio is heavily geared towards commercial real estate (“CRE”). It has $7.6 billion of CRE loans and another $700 million of construction loans. As CRE came under pressure, this exposure has been a source of concern. However, CRE appears less problematic in general—not to mention the fact that CNOB’s own underwriting has proven to be strong, as evidenced by improving credit quality (more on that below).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In particular, while the office still clearly has challenges, we are seeing employers pivot away from remote work, which is a positive for office demand, all else equal. Plus, as interest rates have come off their highs, we have seen capital market access improve, allowing more buildings to refinance and term out their debt, an additional positive. Instead, it appears that there may be more problems in private credit and corporate lending, as seen by headlines of losses over the past month. CNOB’s local and CRE-oriented loan book is much more immune to this pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, FLIC’s balance sheet had a higher share of investment securities, so the company now has $1.25 billion of securities, from $646 million last year. Its investment portfolio yields 4.27%, up 31bps from Q2, given a full quarter impact of FLIC. I expect this to be at or near the peak in yields on this portfolio. Over time, I expect the investment portfolio to become a smaller share of total assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CNOB’s net interest margin (“NIM”) expanded by 5bps sequentially to 3.11%. Importantly, it ended the quarter even stronger at 3.20%, despite a rate cut in September. This creates a very positive launching point for Q4, which should drive incremental net interest income next quarter. NIM was up 44bps from last year, primarily due to a 70bp drop in deposit costs, speaking to the benefit of FLIC’s low-cost deposit base and higher share of NIBs. In Q3, net interest income was $103 million, up 29% sequentially, primarily due to a full quarter of FLIC assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect 3-5% NII growth in Q4, given the NIM improvement we are still seeing. The company still has excess liquidity on its balance sheet as it normalizes its balance sheet post-acquisition. As it deploys this liquidity into loans and other assets, or paying off higher-cost liabilities, we should see NIM continue to improve. CNOB is maintaining a ~99% loan-to-deposit ratio for a second quarter, and I expect it to continue running right around 100%, meaning that loan and deposit growth should broadly track each other going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit quality impresses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to credit quality, during the quarter, ConnectOne took 20bps of net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets are just 28bps, nearly half of the 53bps at the start of the year. The company has $40 million of nonperforming assets, which is actually down $17 million since the start of the year, even with the addition of FLIC’s loans. That is because the bank has been able to work out 3 CRE loans that had fallen to nonaccrual status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, provisions were $5.5 million. Last quarter, it set aside $36 million, but this included $27.4 million as an initial provision against FLIC’s loans. Normalizing for this, Q2 provisions were ~$8 million, so we saw a meaningful sequential improvement here. It has $156 million of reserves for credit losses, providing about 395% coverage of nonaccrual loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Particularly in an asset-backed loan portfolio like CNOB’s, I view coverage of 250% or higher as excellent. With the level of reserves that CNOB is carrying, it is already prepared for a meaningful deterioration in credit quality. In other words, NPAs could rise materially before it has to set aside more reserves. Given I do not expect a recession or material worsening of credit quality, I expect provisions to remain low and see scope for gradual reserve releases over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">With solid capital and improving returns, CNOB is attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, CNOB has a 10.2% common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, down from 11.1% last year, given the ownership of FLIC. This is a healthy level, and CNOB can safely run the bank at about 9.5% capital in my view. As such, it has sufficient capital to ensure its 3% dividend yield is secure, grow its asset base, and likely do some share repurchases next year out of retained earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in August, I was targeting $24.25, or about 1.1x tangible book value. The company ended the quarter with a $22.85 book value. Increasingly, as we are seeing the full benefits of FLIC’s low-deposit base, I see scope for a 1.2x multiple (given a ~12% run-rate ROE). That could push shares towards $27. That can occur if we continue to see steady execution and no surprise in loans inherited from FLIC (which CNOB already does appear reserved for).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view CNOB as having discrete idiosyncratic benefits thanks to its FLIC purchase and improved balance sheet composition, which make it attractive in the regional banking sector. As such, I am upgrading shares to buy as these tailwinds become more apparent with over 12% upside.</p>",

And I suggest that this valuation is unfair to the company and the telecommunications industry as a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> whole. I will try to explain why below.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Future Needs T-Mobile</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I wonder why Wall Street rates telecommunications companies as boring value stocks and fails to see their potential. I see the potential. And in my view, it is huge. When AI development **reaches** the mass consumers, who will supply the connection for the <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/genai-impact-on-mobile-network-traffic\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased traffic</a>?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The answer is simple: it will be cellular operators and providers. Artificial intelligence is very demanding in terms of memory and traffic. That means that when it reaches the mass consumer market, people will need very good mobile communications. And lots of gigabytes and terabytes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the robots will walk the streets, or a lot of cars with different AI or autopilot features will be around. And the Internet of Things will grow, they'll probably need a SIM card and internet access. And this as I think may result in the fact that in America in 5 or 10 years, with a population of, for example, 350 million people, there will be 1 billion mobile subscribers. And most of them will be non-human.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This perspective creates a multiple growth potential for mobile operators in the future. In this case, telecommunications companies' shares will be clear growth stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Reliability</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am quite surprised by T-Mobile's P/E ratio of 20, which is significantly lower than the market average, because this indicator is unfair to a company that reliably generates revenue, even without the prospects I described above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile and the whole network operator industry in my mind is very reliable. Just ask yourself: If tomorrow there will be a crisis like in 2008 or other crisis. Will you save on your communication? I am sure that for 90% or more of people nowadays, cellular communication and smartphones have become a necessity. And people will save on communication as a last resort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It means that mobile operators are reliable companies. Yes, they are competing with each other. And yes, they are taking market share from each other. But in general, people who spend a huge amount of time on their phones these days will not give up their connection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mobile communications is the final mile to the consumer. The AI boom, yearly growth in computing power, and other stuff mean that communications are needed and it will have steady and reliable demand. However, the wave of growth sparked by AI just hasn't hit this industry yet. But I'm sure it will sooner or later.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial Profile</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's talk about finances. We start with some background information. Ten years ago, the company ranked third among mobile operators in the US, behind AT&amp;T and Verizon. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_of_Sprint_Corporation_and_T-Mobile_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">But they bought Sprint</a>, the fourth-largest operator, and jumped to the top.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This deal was closed in 2020. And this deal affected the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS\">financial performance</a>, which you can see in the table below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1548\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"princescreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"159\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile financial indicators <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total revenue grew from $44 billion in 2019 to $80 billion in 2021. Gross profit grew just as strongly as revenue. However, the company's net profit did not grow immediately after revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the expected <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-t-mobile-secured-notes-bbb-01-12-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">effect of the integration</a>. Merging two giant networks, IT systems, teams, and customer bases required huge costs. T-Mobile incurred significant expenses for dismantling Sprint's obsolete equipment, upgrading sites, integrating billing, optimizing staffing, etc. In addition, according to accounting rules, the company began to depreciate (write off) the cost of Sprint's acquired assets by billions of dollars, which also “ate into” net income. Although it was not a direct cash expense. That's why I think that the low profit level of $3 billion was unnatural and temporary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the company got through this costly period, which is confirmed by its profit growth in 2023-2025. And I think that, given the circumstances I've described, the company's current profit level can be considered stable for the combined company. That's why this basis for the P/E ratio is valid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's talk about the company's <a href=\"https://bullfincher.io/companies/t-mobile-us/revenue-by-segment\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenue structure</a>, which you can see in the following table with data for 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w640\" alt=\"self-made\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"466\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile US's revenue by segment <span>(bullfincher)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More than 81% of revenue comes from providing communication services. And as I wrote above, I don't think that people will cut back on these expenses. Therefore, I find this part of the revenue very reliable. As for the rest, which includes the sale of phones and other items that can be called ancillary businesses, their proportion is not high enough to pose a significant risk to the company's financial stability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Expansion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it's very important to say that T-Mobile bought Sprint not only because of its millions of subscribers and economies of scale. The key factor was also that Sprint had an extensive portfolio of radio frequencies, <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/t-mobile-5g-spectrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">especially in the 2.5 GHz mid-band range</a>. This frequency range is the sweet spot for 5G, offering the ideal balance between wide coverage and high bandwidth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By getting these frequencies, T-Mobile was able to quickly roll out its 5G Ultra Capacity network, which was years ahead of similar networks from competitors. Verizon and AT&amp;T finally had to spend time and billions of dollars at C-Band auctions to get similar frequency spectrum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why T-Mobile has not only successfully integrated Sprint subscribers in recent years, but also offered the market the best 5G speeds, attracting new customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After merging with Sprint, T-Mobile showed high growth rates in its customer base, actively taking customers away from Verizon and AT&amp;T due to successful price positioning and rapid deployment of its 5G network. As a result, the company's shares rose significantly in the period 2023-24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in the first half of 2025, investors saw the first signals of a slowdown in subscriber growth. This caused worry among some investors— whether T-Mobile had exhausted its potential for expansion. Especially since competitors by this time had narrowed the gap in deploying 5G networks. This and the general market correction in the spring of this year led to a lower share price for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the data for the past quarter released on October 23 is very promising. Customer base growth has accelerated, as you can see in the table below with quarterly breakdowns of indicators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Selfmade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"581\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile quarterly financial performance <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the table, the financial indicators show overall stability. Yes, there are some minor quarterly fluctuations in revenue and net income. For example, the reduction in net income in Q3 2025 may be due to a one-time factor or investments, but they are not critical in the overall picture. The company generates more than $20 billion in revenue per quarter and billions of dollars in profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, T-Mobile's position as a market leader <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20251022720694/t-mobile-delivers-record-customer-growth-fueled-by-widening-differentiation-and-focus-on-durable-and-profitable-financial-growth-raises-guidance-across-the-board\" rel=\"nofollow\">with 139,9 million customers</a> giving it an advantage of scale. This makes it possible to invest more effectively in the network, providing better coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, the third quarter report confirms the company's leading position in the market. The company continues to move forward. But that's all the details of the current moment; its biggest opportunities are still ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Looking to the Future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, investors are focusing on tech giants as pioneers in AI development, and on data center equipment manufacturers. People expect that in the future, AI will enter into every home, changing our lives and create new markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I would say this. People see that AI needs infrastructure for its “brain,” but they forget that this brain needs infrastructure for the nerves that connect it to the consumer. Without powerful, fast, and ubiquitous connectivity, the whole AI revolution will get stuck in data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that when AI reaches the mass consumer through AI assistants in smartphones, smart cars, AR/VR headsets, and robot assistants, the requirements for communication networks will dramatically change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the evolution of AI, as I wrote above, there will surely be a whole army of new cellular subscribers in the form of machines. Smart cars, drones, industrial robots, simple robots, and many other things will need to connect to the internet. And I guess traffic will increase too, because all this will require a huge flow of information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Telecom operators such as T-Mobile in that situation will be the beneficiaries of AI development. But I'll clarify that this will happen later. It's not happening just now, we don't see strong growth in the financial indicators of mobile operators yet. And my idea cannot be confirmed by figures. It is based on simple logic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI, as I understand it, has not yet reached the mass consumer in sufficient volume to transform the telecommunications market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I wrote in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825279-why-i-believe-the-market-rally-is-losing-steam\">my article on the overall market situation</a>, if we exclude high-tech companies from the calculation, the rest of the economy is stagnating. High interest rates on lending are suppressing investment activity, and consumer demand is weak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But sooner or later, the economy as a whole, not just the AI industry, will grow. The Fed's interest rates will be lower, which will allow a new credit cycle to begin. And then, I think we will see the realization of the idea I have described here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent years, T-Mobile has proven itself to be a strong and growing player in a relatively sluggish telecommunications market. It has become the leader in this market, essentially winning the competitive race. And this state of affairs, in my opinion, gives the company every chance of leading the industry's growth in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile's current valuation reflects only its current business, in an industry that the market values lower than the market average. But the market does not include the enormous growth potential that will inevitably come with the widespread adoption of AI. I expect the telecom sector to experience an AI boom in the future. And T-Mobile is the best way to bet on that future while the market has not yet recognized its value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a market capitalization of $243 billion, T-Mobile has a P/E ratio of only 20. If the share is valued not as a value stock but as a growth stock, the premium to the price will be tens of percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am sure that in the long term, the company's shares will rise significantly in price. But for the moment, I will give a cautious recommendation to Buy. I will refrain from recommending a “Strong Buy” because my thesis is based on a logic and forecast of future developments, rather than on past events reflected in the figures. And I see macroeconomic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzMJaTeOkH4\" rel=\"nofollow\">and political risks</a> for the market in the next six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the company's chart, I would strongly recommend buying the company's shares if they reach the support level marked on the chart below. This could happen if the US market as a whole turns negative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1409\" data-height=\"542\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Print screen\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T Mobile chart <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But somehow, either with support or without it, the stock will move up and rise significantly in price in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that any dip in T-Mobile stock caused by short-term market or macroeconomic factors should be used to buy or add to positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, I'd like to point out that it's possible that the market will see the potential ahead of time, and then the shares could start growing from any level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect that T-Mobile and the whole telecom sector are on the verge of a major transformation—from “boring” value companies to growth companies of the new digital era.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk, as you might guess, is the situation in the US market as a whole due to politics and macroeconomics. If a correction is ahead for the S&amp;P 500 index, T-Mobile shares will not be able to ignore it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the key risk is timing. My investment thesis is based on the expectation that the industry will be transformed by AI. But I can't say for sure when exactly this turning point will come.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there are other, more traditional risks, such as increased competition or unfavorable regulatory changes, among others. But based on my main thesis, I think these factors are less critical.</p>",

While the fund has done well<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> relative to broader equity indexes, the bar is set very high for growth funds. The following sections will break down FFLG’s holdings and compare the fund’s valuation, performance, volatility, and tradability aspects with the Russell 1000 and other growth funds.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF Description &amp; Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG seeks long-term capital appreciation through exposure to companies that Fidelity identifies as exhibiting higher revenue and earnings growth potential than the broader equity market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s investment process is based on the fundamental analysis of companies with similar market capitalization to the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 indexes, taking into consideration elements such as financial health, earnings outlook, companies’ strategy and management, along with their position in the related industry and economic outlook. A quantitative process is then applied to build the fund’s portfolio, following a high-conviction approach, while maintaining risk at appropriate levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of October 27, 2025, FFLG had $526 million in assets under management, invested across 90 holdings, with an average market cap of $739 billion, more than double that of the Russell 1000 index, represented here by the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>). The fund’s larger capitalization tilt is clear, with mega caps accounting for 67.9% of total assets, while this category makes up only 43.2% of the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s top ten holdings highlight its oversized allocation to big techs. NVIDIA (15.68%), Microsoft (9.54%), and Apple (8.66%) are the largest positions, while Amazon (6.38%), Meta Platforms (5.14%), Alphabet Class A (4.30%), and Class C (2.33%) are also overweight compared to equity market benchmarks. Broadcom (3.60%) and Taiwan Semiconductor (2.40%) reinforce the fund’s bet on the semiconductor industry, while Netflix (2.20%) is another key internet platform player.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"395\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following table presents a mix of large-cap growth funds, with the last three also relying on companies’ fundamentals in the selection process.

Far below are communication services at 17.8% and consumer discretionary at 12.2%. Smaller allocations include healthcare (6.8%) and industrials (5.7%), while financial services stand at a modest 5.0%, offering some cyclical exposure. Meanwhile, sectors such as consumer staples, basic materials, utilities, and real estate each remain below 1.5% of total assets, while energy holds only 0.1%. As a result, FFLG is overweight in technology (+14.2%) and communication services (+7.6%), while maintaining underweight positions in financial services (-8.0%), consumer staples (-3.7%), and energy (-2.8%), reflecting its limited exposure to traditional value areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking down the fund’s positions across the largest sectors, we see that in technology, there are just 11 holdings, despite its large stance in the sector. Semiconductors make up nearly half of the sector, with shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. Software exposure includes Microsoft, Oracle, and Cadence, offering exposure to enterprise systems and chip design. Beyond that, Apple remains one of the fund’s largest positions as well, while smaller allocations in AppLovin, Nutanix, and Coherent add diversification to the fund in areas like app monetization, cloud infrastructure, and photonics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In communication services, FFLG owns a few companies, with large positions in Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund also holds positions in Roblox, a platform for interactive gaming and virtual creation, and Netflix, the well-known streaming provider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positions in consumer discretionary, on the other hand, are more diversified, spread across 13 holdings. Digital retail is a core segment, with positions in Amazon, Carvana, and Wayfair. Traditional retail plays a role as well, with Lowe’s and TJX providing exposure to home improvement and value-focused apparel, respectively. The fund also owns Tesla, representing the auto segment, and Starbucks, the global coffee retailer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside the FFLG’s three largest sectors, it still maintains exposure to a wide range of industries that add diversification to the fund. The most significant allocations include Howmet Aerospace, Axon Enterprise, and FTAI Aviation in aerospace and defense; Mastercard and Affirm in consumer finance; and several healthcare names, such as Boston Scientific, Eli Lilly, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Other minor positions include Apollo Global Management and Coinbase in capital markets, and GE Vernova in industrial conglomerates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"471\" height=\"434\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s large allocation to technology is in line with its typical growth peers like VUG, IWF, and SCHG, which also keep nearly half of the total assets in the sector. On the flip side, other more fundamentals-driven peers such as TMFC and FDG have a nearly 40% exposure to technology, which remains overweight compared to the Russell 1000’s 34.5% allocation. In turn, similar to FFLG, those fundamentally driven funds (FBCG, TMFC, and FDG) also have heavier positions in communication services in the 16% to 18% range, given the strong profitability and growth prospects of names like Meta Platforms and Alphabet. However, FFLG is underweight in sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, reflecting more outsized positions of specific funds like FDG (19.7% in consumer discretionary) and TMFC (15.0% in financial services), rather than the whole peer group’s upbeat consensus in these sectors. As a result, there is a very strong sector correlation among the whole peer group. FFLG’s correlation with most peers is 0.99, while it remains as high as 0.96 with TMFC and FDG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"887\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"301\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation In Line With The Peer Group Average</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a 30.5x P/E, FFLG trades at a large 36% premium to the Russell 1000’s 22.4x. This is largely driven by the fund’s overweight allocation to technology, since the sector’s average valuation is close to 36x P/E. But it is not the only reason. FFLG’s stock picking across sectors such as industrials, financial services, and healthcare also plays a role, as core holdings in these sectors, including Howmet Aerospace, Boston Scientific, and Mastercard, to name a few, all trade above 30x P/E.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund delivers on growth. Its historical earnings growth (22.2%) handily surpasses the Russell 1000 (7.4%), while its sales growth (11.1%) is also above the benchmark (7.4%). Earnings growth in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors is particularly higher than the benchmark, contributing to the fund's growth measures. However, the key factor remains its overweight exposure to these above-average growth areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, profitability indicators are more mixed. FFLG’s EBITDA margin (38.1%) is 2.1 percentage points higher than the Russell 1000 (36.0%), again due to its exposure to technology, as core holdings exhibit strong margins, such as NVIDIA (59.5%) and Microsoft (55.6%). Overweight positions in Meta Platforms (EBITDA margin 52.7%) and Mastercard (62.1%) help as well. On the other hand, FFLG’s ROE of 54.0% remains high, but lags the Russell 1000’s 59.2%, mainly due to negative ROE in holdings within healthcare (Alnylam: -5.0%), and communication (Roblox: -21.2%), which end up affecting the fund’s composite ROE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and ETFs’ websites, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"448\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and ETFs’ websites, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG trades in the middle of the peers’ valuation range. Funds like VUG and IWF exhibit slightly higher valuations, driven by a larger exposure to technology. FDG’s valuation is the highest in the group, reflecting also higher allocation to consumer discretionary, while TMFC is the only one trading below 30x P/E, given its more measured stance in technology and consumer discretionary, along with an outsized allocation to financial services, a value sector by nature. Still, all funds trade well above the Russell 1000, which makes sense due to their much higher average earnings (22.8%) and sales growth (12.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"828\" data-height=\"241\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outperforming The Russell 1000, But Lagging Most Peers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its inception in 2021, FFLG already has a track record of three years. During this period, it has delivered an uneven performance, with a steep decline in 2022, one of the worst among peers, offset by a strong rebound in 2023, the only year it has surpassed the peer group average. This is reflected in its 3-year annualized returns of 31.6%, the second worst among peers. Still, this is more than enough to make FFLG outperform broader equity indexes, such as the Russell 1000, which delivered 22.2% in the same time window.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s volatility has been relatively high, with a 3-year beta of 1.26, which is high even for a growth fund standard, where the beta’s average is 1.15. This positions FFLG as the second-highest beta, only below FBCG (1.29). The fund’s capture ratio both to upside and downside at around 130 also highlights its historical tendency to amplify the broader market price action by a wide margin. For comparison, peers with a more conservative volatility profile (VUG, IWF, SCHG, and TMFC) have remained below 120.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"853\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s average daily volume of $1.23 million is light compared to heavyweights like VUG, IWF, and SCHG, which trade hundreds of millions a day. Of course, FFLG’s bid-ask spread of 0.06% is wider than these very liquid funds, but remains in line with peers FBCG and TMFC. Its turnover of 52% is one of the highest in the group and is somewhat inconsistent with the fund’s claim of keeping a long-term investment perspective. This leads to an expense ratio of 0.38%, higher than market-cap-weighted funds (VUG, IWF, and SCHG), but still below other actively managed peers (FCG, TMFC, and FDG). The fund offers a low dividend yield of 0.19%, way below the broader market average of nearly 1%, though in line with peers, as all funds are below 0.5%. The fund tracking error, in the range of 8% to 9%, is above the average, while its Sharpe ratio of 1.33 (3-year) is the lowest among peers, along with FDG, as other peers have managed to deliver higher returns with more contained volatility. It is worth noting that FFLG’s Sharpe Ratio is still in line with the Russell 1000’s 1.32 (3-year), as a combination of the index’s arguably strong gains and moderate volatility (beta of 1.02).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"776\" data-height=\"376\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s playbook is clear: a high-conviction fund with a portfolio that relies on mega caps to deliver growth. Its strong tilt toward technology is a consensus across growth funds, but it goes a step further through an overweight allocation to communication services. This sector mix and stock selection leave the fund trading at a premium to broad equity indexes, though in line with most peers, while a concentrated portfolio helps explain its above-average volatility. That said, there is no question that the fund has an aggressive profile. However, expectations for further interest rate cuts and generally positive Q3 earnings remain a positive setup for growth-oriented funds.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, FFLG is among the options to ride the expected continued strength in large-cap growth stocks. But, as we know, with stock market valuations at current levels and the likelihood of softer growth ahead, we should also acknowledge the risks of pullbacks along the way. And here is where FFLG seems not to be the best answer right now. Its high beta profile signals greater downside risk in a market that may see a bumpy ride going forward. Thus, I take a neutral view on this fund, as other growth peers are expected to offer a more balanced risk-reward ratio in this environment.</p>",

In my opinion, Meta's 7% drop is an excellent engagement opportunity and I am confirming my strong buy rating after the firm's third-quarter earnings report!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_e6578ca3ab8442e9c71e0ed0cbc6d4b6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Previous rating</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I recommended Meta in my previous work on the social media company in July -- <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806643-meta-path-to-a-1000\">Path To $1,000</a> -- because the social media platform benefited from a strong digital advertising backdrop. This view was confirmed yesterday as Meta reported a large increase in its revenues and free cash flow. I like that the social media company is extremely profitable and therefore in a good position to absorb higher CapEx spending. Shares of Meta are also attractively valued relative to other big tech companies, and I see rebound potential in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Meta's Q3’25 earnings impacted by one-off tax impacts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The social media company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510678-meta-gaap-eps-of-1_05-misses-by-5_66-revenue-of-51_24b-beats-by-1_83b\">missed</a> consensus EPS expectations on Wednesday, leading to selling pressure for Meta's shares in the after-hours market: the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.05 per-share which fell short of the average EPS prediction by $5.66. The top line however came in at $51.2B, out-matching the average prediction by $1.8B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite strong operational results for Q3’25, Meta recorded a non-cash $15.9B tax charge related to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This tax charge is non-recurring and will therefore not impact Meta’s financial results in the future. Because of this non-recurring tax impact, Meta saw a 83% Y/Y drop-off in its net income to $2.7B.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Despite earnings drop, Meta sees strong core advertising performance</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The social media giant recorded $51.2B in total revenue in the third-quarter, showing 26% year-over-year growth, mainly due to a continually strong performance in the digital advertising market.

However, as I have shown above, Meta still generates a ton of \"excess\" free cash flow (the cash flow remaining after CapEx needs have been met) that is available for other investments and stock buybacks. In Q3'25, Meta spent $3.3B on Class A stock buybacks which calculates to a free cash flow percentage of ~31%. More stock buybacks going forward, potential acquisitions of AI start-ups to support Meta's strategic investment in its own superintelligence business, and a strong advertising segment performance in Q4 could all be near term catalysts for a share price rebound.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Meta’s valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most appealing elements of Meta is that the company is extremely free cash flow-profitable <em>and</em> still trading at a very affordable P/E ratio of 25.0X. In fact, Meta is the cheapest big tech stock in the industry group and now even cheaper than Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) which translates to a strong value proposition: the industry group average price-to-earnings ratio, based off of FY 2026 earnings, is currently 28.2X with Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) being the most expensive company in the big tech group with a forward P/E ratio of 30.3X. This implies that Meta trades at an 11% discount to the industry group P/E ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Meta, in my opinion, could easily trade at ~35.0X forward earnings considering how profitable the social media platform is and that it continues to display favorable KPIs trends in its core advertising business (rising average ad prices).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 35X P/E ratio, applied to a FY 2026 consensus EPS estimate of $30.08, implies a fair value in the neighborhood of $1,053/share, implying 49% upside revaluation potential. With Meta now being the cheapest big tech investment that investors can make, on an earnings basis, Wednesday's after-market price drop could be seen as an attractive buying opportunity for growth investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with Meta</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The social media company is going on an aggressive CapEx spending spree in order to cement its leading position in the AI race. Meta is spending billions of dollars on attracting AI talent and building Data Centers in order to cash in on the AI boom. Therefore, a misallocation of CapEx dollars and a lack of adequate investment returns on its AI spending pose risks for investors. What would change my mind about Meta is if the digital advertising market were to see a reduction in ad spending levels, leading to a drop-off in platform profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta grew its top line very fast (+26% Y/Y) in the third-quarter and all of the firm's growth comes from digital advertising. Advertisers continue to spend a ton of money on online ads, and as the largest social media platforms in the U.S., Meta is in a great position to benefit from strong demand for advertising services in the fourth-quarter.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Meta are currently valued at only 25.0X forward earnings, which makes the tech enterprise a steal in the big tech industry group, especially when considering that the social media platform is growing its revenues at double-digits and that the $15.9B Q3 tax charge is only going to be a one-time event. With Meta set to benefit from Christmas-driven advertising spending in Q4 and an earnings rebound on the horizon, I believe investors should be buying the drop.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a></span>). In the article, I rated the stock as a “Hold” but in my conclusion, I was rather cautious<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and leaned more towards a bearish point of view:</span></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>It is very difficult to answer the question if Broadcom is fairly valued right now and if the stock is a buying opportunity. Considering the high risk of a recession and the high probability of semiconductor sales (including AI sales) declining combined with Broadcom still trading for high valuation multiples, I would be very cautious. Broadcom is certainly not a “Buy” in my opinion and a “Hold” at best. But I still see rather high downside risk right now and would not be surprised if the stock is cut in half again.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at the stock performance since then, the stock was not cut in half, but almost doubled. While the S&amp;P 500 increased 25% in value (which is already a great performance), Broadcom increased 92% in value and was the<a href=\"https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;f=idx_sp500&amp;o=-perf26w\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> 8th best performing stock</a> in the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the impressive performance, I will argue once again that Broadcom is a „Hold“ at best. Aside from the revenue concentration and only a few companies being responsible for a huge part of revenue (which might not necessarily be a problem), it is especially the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry making me cautious. Additionally, we should not ignore the risk of AI being a bubble right now and companies suddenly reducing investments in AI-infrastructure. When combining these risks with the high valuation multiples Broadcom is trading for right now, my assessment of Broadcom is rather bearish right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s start by looking at the last quarterly results and Broadcom reported great results once again and<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4492480-broadcom-non-gaap-eps-of-1_69-beats-by-0_03-revenue-of-15_95b-beats-by-130m\"> beat on revenue as well as earnings per share.</a>. And not only did Broadcom beat expectations, but net revenue also increased from $13,072 million in Q3/24 to $15,952 million in Q3/25 – resulting in 22.0% year-over-year top line growth. While revenue already grew at a high pace, operating income increased 55.4% year-over-year from $3,788 million in the same quarter last year to $5,887 million in this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1568\" data-height=\"1444\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom is reporting third quarter results for fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"589\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom 10-Q (Q3/25)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And finally, the company switched from a diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the same quarter last year to a diluted net income per share of $0.85 in this quarter. And non-GAAP earnings per share increased from $1.24 in Q3/24 to $1.69 in Q3/25 – resulting in 36.3% year-over-year growth.

On average, return on invested capital was 12.63% in the last 10 years but we see huge fluctuations between a negative return of 7% in 2016 and 31% in 2018. In the last two years, return on invested capital also fluctuated heavily – in 2023 it was 24%, in 2024 it was 8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will come back to growth assumptions for Broadcom in the years to come. At this point, our statement of Broadcom (and the semiconductor industry) being cyclical is enough and we should not make the mistake to suddenly assume high and highly consistent growth rates now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 2: Revenue Concentration</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its last Annual Report, Broadcom stated once again that a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of the company’s net revenue. In fiscal 2024, management is estimating that aggregate sales to the top five end customers (through all different channels) account for 40% of total revenue (after accounting for 35% of sales in 2023). Management is also estimating that a significant customer concentration in the years to come will remain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Broadcom is not disclosing which five customers are accounting for such a huge portion of revenue, it is mostly considered to be Apple Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Alphabet Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and one large distributor, which is selling a huge amount of products from Broadcom. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In case of B2B businesses, a concentration on only a few customers is not unusual. However, the risk remains that a single customer can lead to a steep revenue decline and therefore has a huge impact on the overall performance of the business. Being responsible for a huge part of overall revenue is also leading to pricing power for these customers and as Broadcom investors, we don’t want a customer to have pricing power over Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, Broadcom added another major customer to its list as the company and OpenAI signed a contract.<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> In a press release</a>, OpenAI states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>OpenAI and Broadcom today announced a collaboration for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators. OpenAI will design the accelerators and systems, which will be developed and deployed in partnership with Broadcom. (…) OpenAI and Broadcom have long-standing agreements on the co-development and supply of the AI accelerators. The two companies have signed a term sheet to deploy racks incorporating the AI accelerators and Broadcom networking solutions.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And although it is not clear whether Broadcom will actually generate $10 billion in sales from this deal (it seems likely that $10 billion is the project value and not the revenue Broadcom will generate), we are talking about 17% of Broadcom’s annual revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, it is a multi-year deal for Broadcom and therefore might add maybe $2 billion in annual revenue. I don’t want to downplay this deal as it is a huge win for Broadcom, but company needs to grow at a high pace in order to be fairly valued and this deal alone might add about 3% annual growth for the next few years, which is just a fraction of the necessary growth rate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 3: High Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third and biggest risks that remains is the high valuation multiples Broadcom is trading for. And since my last article, the valuation multiples got even higher. Right now, Broadcom is trading for 86.4 times earnings, and this is clearly above the long-term average of 47.06. Additionally, the stock is now trading for a P/FCF ratio of 65.6, which is clearly above the long-term average of 22.99 and much higher than in my last article in April 2025 (P/FCF ratio was 35.5 back then).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead of just looking at simple valuation multiples, we will calculate an intrinsic value for the stock by using a discount cash flow calculation once again. As always, let’s calculate with a 10% discount rate and the last reported number of diluted shares outstanding (4,860 million). As basis for our calculation, we use the free cash flow of the last four quarters ($24,930 million) and in order to be fairly valued, Broadcom must grow 20% annually for the next ten years followed by a 6% growth rate till perpetuity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are already high growth rates and only a few companies are able to achieve such high growth rates over long timeframes. However, we could also make the argument that using a discount rate of 10% might not be enough in case of Broadcom. When calculating a WACC by using the last reported numbers for debt, equity, cost of debt and tax rate and using the 10-year treasury yield as risk free rate and adding a 6% market risk premium, we get a number close to 18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fairly valued in this scenario, Broadcom has to grow 44% annually for the next ten years followed by 6% growth till perpetuity. While I would see an annual growth of 44% for ten years in a row being out of reach, we should also not forget that this calculation is implying an 18% annual return for investors over the long run (which would be great and a number only a handful of investors are able to constantly achieve).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Growth Estimates</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s stick with our first calculation and ask whether a growth rate of 20% annually is realistic for Broadcom. Now we can come back to OpenAI’s $10 billion project. Even with that amount spent in only 12 months, it would not be enough to lead to 20% growth. I don’t claim that 20% annual growth is impossible for Broadcom and in the last ten years, the company grew its earnings per share with a CAGR of 28.66%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management is also optimistic in its short-term guidance and for the upcoming quarter. During the last earnings call CFO Kirsten Spears made the following statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $17.4 billion, up 24% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $10.7 billion, up 30% year-on-year. Within this, we expect Q4 AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion, up 66% year-on-year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up 15% year-on-year.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">She also pointed out that margins might be a little lower in the upcoming quarter due to an unfavorable product mix and lower margin products growing with a higher pace. However, this is probably still resulting in about 20% growth for the bottom line. Broadcom does not really offer a mid-or-long-term guidance (at least no specific figures), but analysts are offering growth expectations for the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1388\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom: Consensus EPS Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Broadcom: Consensus EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/earnings/estimates\">Analysts are quite optimistic</a> for the next few years and between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2029, earnings per share are expected to grow with a CAGR of 34.6% and therefore more than enough to justify the growth rates in the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When talking about high, double-digit growth rates, the biggest part of growth usually must come from top line growth as in most cases neither share buybacks nor margin improvement can contribute with such a high pace. For share buybacks to lead to more than 10% annual growth (assuming a company does not take on additional debt for share buybacks) a stock must always at a single digit price-free-cash flow ratio. And margin improvement contributing at least 10% annually to growth will lead quickly to margins close to 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, we should not ignore that improving margins are also contributing to bottom line growth. And over the last 20 years, Broadcom is reporting constantly improving margins. Although we see fluctuations (especially for the operating margin, the gross margin is more stable), margins are moving higher over the long run, which is a good sign for the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we should also look at the number of diluted shares outstanding.

From a German point of view, energy prices are still extremely low in the United States, but people might get more and more annoyed about rising energy prices, which could lead to a discussion whether AI companies must pay for these costs somehow and this might have an impact on future investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I see it as a possibility that Broadcom will grow with a pace of 20% or more in the next ten years, I am rather on the side of caution and would not bet on these growth rates to keep up for such a long timeframe. After all, Broadcom is a cyclical business (see section above).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Broadcom is too expensive to be a good investment. Of course, I must admit that the stock was a great investment in the last five years, and I was clearly too pessimistic. Nevertheless, I don’t know whether Broadcom is a good long-term investment at this point or whether the company must grow into the stock’s extremely high valuation in the next few years leading to either a stagnating stock price over a few years or a steeper decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don’t want to short Broadcom at this point as valuation multiples don’t seem so discounted from reality that a “Sell” rating is justified, but at this point the stock is a “Hold” at best.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) called “The Next To Join The $3 Trillion Club.” The rationale was, and remains, quite simple. Amazon is one of the best-positioned companies in trends such as cloud, AI, and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> e-commerce, among several other segments that have secular growth. All this comes with a valuation below its average, which allows us to say that its margin of safety is one of the best among the magnificent seven today.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But obviously, there are some reasons why the company is trading below its historical average, such as greater maturity of its margin (but in my view, it still has a lot of room to expand), but mainly factors such as Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") growing less than its peers, in addition to issues such as tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q2, my post-release <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807151-amazon-q2-almost-flawless-performance-misunderstood-by-the-market\">article</a>, I argued that the market had misunderstood the quarter, as the stock was falling about 4% in after-hours trading, with the market concerned about guidance and AWS growing “only” 17.5% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">Q3 came</a> to change that perception. It was a very positive quarter, where the company showed that AWS is not lagging behind and that the other segments also continue to have strong momentum. And this time, the market recognized this in a very significant way, with AMZN shares already reaching almost 10% gains in after-hours trading. But while I recognize that this quarter was positive, I don't consider it any more bullish than <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4475905-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_68-beats-by-0_35-revenue-of-167_7b-beats-by-5_59b\">Q2</a> was, and that's why the title of this analysis is that the market is not that right about this quarter, and may be overreacting again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon Q3: A Trick But Solid Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I liked the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287289-amazon-com-announces-third-quarter-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 earnings</a>, but before breaking it down, it's worth commenting on market perception. In Q2, sales growth was 13% YoY, exactly the same growth as in Q3. The difference in top line is that in the last quarter, international contributed more to this growth, and in this quarter, AWS resumed its growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand that the narrative of Cloud and AI ends up being more important pillars than just international growth, even because of their representation in operating income, but this is enough to show how often the market is focusing on very short-term triggers, and it is enough to either punish the stock heavily or cause it to trade 10% higher after just one quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511697-amazon-surges-after-q3-beat-driven-by-aws-ad-growth-offsetting-margin-pressures\">10% gains</a> in after-hours trading are an overreaction; the company deserves this recognition, but note that just by slightly improving the clarity of the prospects, which, let's face it, weren't that bad in the last quarter, Mr. Market added $200 billion in market cap to Amazon. What I mean is that even though the prospects have improved, and the third quarter results are good, Amazon is essentially the same company it was three months ago, meaning that Amazon shareholders who are focused on the long term had an opportunity to increase their exposure to an excellent company due to an “overreaction” by the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Returning to the results, Amazon achieved $180.2 billion in sales this quarter, which is a 13.4% YoY growth, exceeding market estimates by about $2.44 billion, but that means a small beat of about 1.5%. Where the company really surprised was in EPS, which exceeded estimates by $0.39, or a beat of more than 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as we saw in yesterday's analysis of Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (you can check it <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834994-alphabet-q3-ive-never-been-more-bullish-on-google-rating-upgrade\">here</a>), this beat should be analyzed in a little more depth. Note in the <a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">income statement</a> below that Q3 2025 operating income was virtually unchanged from Q3 2024. What really changed was other income, which was inflated by gains from investments in Anthropic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"869\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Income Statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"550\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon 10-Q</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think this makes it a bad quarter, much less a cause for concern for long-term shareholders, as it also shows how Amazon had the strategic vision to invest in a company that is already perceived to have improved potential. What should be clear is that the jump in EPS was not that high this quarter when compared YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for this is that the operating margin decreased in all segments compared to Q3 2024. North America went from 5.9% to 4.5%, and International went from 3.6% to 2.9%, while AWS went from 38.1% to 34.6%. This would be an extremely bearish point if it were basically such a significant increase in the cost and expense structure to sustain top-line growth that was not that high, but in fact, much of this was more cyclical than structural.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North America, for example, would have had an operating income of $7.3 billion, had it not been for the $2.5 billion charge from a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. In other words, without this impact, the operating margin would have gone from 5.9% to 6.9%. In the other segments, all were impacted by “costs related to planned role eliminations,” according to the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also worth mentioning that the guidance for Q4 is in the range of $206 to $213 billion, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511758-earnings-snapshot-amazon-tops-expectations-as-aws-sales-rise-20\">$1.37 billion</a> above the estimates midpoint, which also alleviates some concerns about a slowdown at this time of year and competition with players such as the intense dispute that is taking place in Brazil with MercadoLibre (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MELI\" title=\"MercadoLibre, Inc.\">MELI</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"662\" data-height=\"345\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Q3 results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding AWS, the release mentioned that the Cloud business is accelerating due to strong demand for AI and core infrastructure. This is very bullish and one of the things that the market is weighing, in my view, but I also liked another comment even more:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is just another endorsement that it is possible to be bullish on Amazon's bottom line in the long term, with more and more AI and robotics improving the company's efficiency and consequently improving the shareholder value that can be generated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the margin was not that bearish for Amazon's case, so together with the improvement in top-line growth, it is still possible to say that it was a very solid quarter. This corroborates the perception that Amazon is very well-positioned.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon: 17% Gains For 2026? Sign Me In</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a value investor, and someone who was already bullish on Amazon before this quarter, even though the quarter showed that the next few quarters are a little clearer in terms of AWS growth and margin improvement, the 10% after-hours gains slightly worsen the margin of safety and my appetite for increasing my position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But remembering my last analysis, in which I argue that the company could reach around $3 trillion in market cap in 2026, these 10% gains still do not remove all the asymmetry from the case, since we are still talking about a market cap of ~$2.55 trillion after this correction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My latest projections, based on very reasonable assumptions, already show operating income of $97 billion for 2026, without the company having to maintain growth above 10% for North America and international markets, nor maintain such a high margin for the segments. In other words, if the momentum we saw in Q3 continues, it is possible that this number will be exceeded without much difficulty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1432\" data-height=\"573\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author (Kenio Fontes)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if we are talking about $100 billion in operating income and a multiple of 30x, again, we are already talking about a $3 trillion market cap for 2026. If the market already assigns this multiple in December next year, we are talking about a 17% upside for the next ~14 months, which is very attractive for a company of this quality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though I believe that the market has been overreacting to earnings lately and is increasingly less focused on the long term, I believe that Amazon's third quarter was positive. In addition, the 10% gains do not remove all the margin of safety from the position, and we can still easily envision more double-digit returns next year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I still see Amazon stock as a solid Buy.</p>",

We do this by selling call options, where the managers decide on the strike or the price that the stock has to hit before it is called away, or the seller is forced to sell, And the length of time until the expiration of the contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">YieldMax does all of this for you, and the NVDY value proposition is essentially that the active management of day-to-day options trading is taken care of for 1.27% per year. This is a fee that is likely worth paying if you are interested in this strategy and are unwilling to execute it on your own or unable to due to time constraints, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I outlined the specifics of their strategy in an article in January. As far as I know, there hasn't been much change to the way that they target strikes, so reviewing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4750202-nvdy-risks-remain-too-high-despite-its-excellent-performance\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4750202-nvdy-risks-remain-too-high-despite-its-excellent-performance\" target=\"_blank\">that section on strategy construction</a> is still relevant today. There, you can see my modeling of the options positions in more granular details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long and short is that the fund is 100% short-term Treasuries, which are used to secure options against Nvidia. They use these options to create synthetic exposure to long stock, mirroring the profit and loss of holding shares outright. They then sell dynamically against this position, attempting to generate at least 80% of the stock's upside, by moving into and out of options positions every day. You can find the intraday trading logs on <a href=\"https://yieldmaxetfs.com/our-etfs/nvdy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://yieldmaxetfs.com/our-etfs/nvdy/\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top holdings look like this, but note that they change every day:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"829\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDY holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"436\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YieldMax ETFs</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What it boils down to is that it's nearly impossible for investors to track and calculate every move that NVDY makes. But I don't think that's the point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want that level of granular detail, which I used to provide these analyses, I think you're likely better off running your own options strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those invested in this fund are likely interested in offloading the options management. And while they're likely interested in how that management works, I think the bigger worry is how well this fund will work when NVDA is not on a bull run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Will it still produce enough income for them? What about their principle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the kinds of questions I think are more important than \"how out of the money are their strikes?\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fighting Gravity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I worry quite a bit about capital destruction, which is present in many covered call funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way it works with these funds is like this:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The fund sells a call.</li> <li>The fund's underlying asset breaches the strike of that call.</li> <li>The fund must realize a loss in order to roll the call.</li> <li>This results in capital loss for investors.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the strike of the call is not breached, and in those cases, the covered call investment wins. This is easier to do as a manager when you are working with an index, which tends to move more slowly and in response to macro events. This is much harder to do as a manager with a single stock that responds idiosyncratically, due to earnings results and things said by management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps too cynically, I see that these kinds of idiosyncratic issues of being at the whims of one stock are increasingly a problem of the indexes, where the Nasdaq is now nearly 10% NVDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is this destruction in action. Remember that earlier I was just showing total return, which includes all dividends reinvested.

I feel the same way about almost all single stock covered call ETFs, and I think that many investors are suckered in by the promise of ultra-high income figures. But protecting one's principle is incredibly important. Protecting principle affects your ability to cash flow in the future; We must remember that those needing income don't just need it today, tomorrow, next month, or next year, but potentially for 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you erode your capital too fast, and in two years, -15% to me is too fast, then you will have little left at that 10-15-20 year mark. Of course, you could solve this by reinvesting part of the distributions and trimming down any distribution above some necessary limit, likely dependent on your personal income needs, could work to solve this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't like recommending DRIP, even partial DRIP, because it is so idiosyncratic to your income needs, and also because I feel like it covers for the fund's greatest weakness, which is that it has historically over-distributed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While that trend hasn't been present since May, it should be noted that since May, NVIDIA has been back on its near-vertical trajectory, and so it's tough to objectively evaluate good performance in a bull run.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">RoC &amp; Taxes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I hinted at the Return of Capital (\"RoC\") component a bit earlier, but I think it deserves its own section. I feel less and less of a need to cover this because it is becoming much more widely known among the income investing community, but it still bears mentioning that part of the returns of NVDY are RoC, which have special tax rules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's what you need to know:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>RoC is not considered taxable income in the year that you earned it.</li> <li>Instead, RoC is counted against your cost basis.</li> <li>Taxes are realized when you sell the shares, allowing for deferred taxes on gains made from NVDY, despite receiving the income every week.</li> <li>If your cost basis hits zero, then all future ROC distributions are taxed in the year that you receive them, but they are all taxed at your long-term capital gains tax rate.</li> <li>Because capital gains tax rates are traditionally and typically lower than income tax rates, this makes the distributions from NVDY more attractive to income investors investing outside tax-advantaged accounts.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is the schedule of all the distributions since April and the amount of ROC that they were. It ranges anywhere from 95-97% to 0%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1207\" data-height=\"438\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDY distribution schedule.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YieldMax ETFs</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVIDIA had a very good earnings call in Q2, and they've announced more partnerships since then, and their business is growing. Meanwhile, NVDY promises income in exchange for giving up some of the upside on the world's most valuable company. I find that proposition tough to swallow, especially because of NVIDIA's trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I always recommend more diversified exposure within covered call funds because being beholden to the idiosyncratic risks, like losing out on upside that results from earnings updates which often happen suddenly and without warning, can lead to long-term capital erosion. This is true of almost all single-stock ETFs. In that, I feel investors are better served with other funds. That being said, some are and have been rewarded tremendously by this, though they often lag the underlying asset. In this way, it feels like only a partial win where you were right on the bet and suffered through all the volatility like in April but were only given a partial reward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I'm going to suffer all the downside, I want all the upside. I don't feel this way about indexes, of which I have, and which I need less conviction to invest large amounts of money into. That is not true for individual stocks. Having the conviction necessary to hold on during drawdowns is very difficult, especially if you are not being rewarded through all the upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider that, as well as your timeline and your ability to withstand capital erosion and long-term drawdowns of your principal, before investing in NVDY.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",

Given that I've <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815193-novo-nordisk-cleared-for-climb\">previously conducted a more detailed</a>, and I think it's fair to say, very<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> positive analysis, and currently rate Novo as a Buy, I thought it’s the perfect time to unpack and reassess the risks involved, and take a fresh look at them ahead of earnings.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve admitted to myself—and I believe I’m not the only one—that we tend to fall in love with our own decisions, and that can often turn out to be a costly mistake. Psychologically, when someone strongly believes in a particular investment, they often look for information that confirms the validity and strength of the thought process they had when making the decision to buy that position. Sometimes the belief can become so strong that acknowledging risks—even when they’re flashing right in front of you—becomes incredibly difficult.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My current thinking has been that Novo—while I do acknowledge there are some risks out there—remains undervalued. That’s why I’ve been fairly comfortable letting NVO hover in the $50–55 range, without paying too much attention, and waiting for it to find a stronger footing. Given the relatively non-emotional mindset considering Novo I’m in right now, I think it’s the perfect time to actively search for and lay out all the risks, and to look them straight in the eye for what they are to preempt any surprises before earnings kick in next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said—and since I’ve already done a more detailed analysis earlier—let's jump straight into the potential sources of headwinds and examine them through the lens of what may have shifted since my last review back in August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Just as I was finishing this analysis, news broke that Novo has made a bid to outplay Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) with a new offer for Metsera (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTSR\" title=\"Metsera, Inc.\">MTSR</a>). Having done a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828589-pfizer-mastering-the-art-of-the-deal-with-metsera-upgraded-to-buy\">couple of analyses</a> on this topic—including one focused on Metsera before Pfizer’s deal was announced—I'll briefly share a few thoughts here.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Novo-Metsera</strong></em></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it wasn’t solely my original thought—a few analysts also wrote on the same topic—I highlighted it in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828589-pfizer-mastering-the-art-of-the-deal-with-metsera-upgraded-to-buy\">my analysis</a> of the Pfizer-Metsera deal:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><em>At least one of the current leaders in the obesity sector likely fought with Pfizer until the very final stages and also presented a higher bid. However, the ultimate consideration by Metseras’ board reportedly centered on potential regulatory headwinds. Common sense suggests that the only bidders who would face such intense regulatory scrutiny are the current obesity sector duopoly members—their involvement would have certainly drawn that kind of attention.</em></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it’s worth acknowledging that the original thinking held water—the higher bidder did turn out to be Novo. Second, it’s hard to view the deal as immediately positive for Novo. It could reflect a cautious outlook on their own pipeline, suggesting they may lack full confidence in their current developments. From a longer-term perspective, however, the science behind Metsera appears very strong, as I concluded in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821206-metsera-an-emerging-contender-in-the-glp1-arena\">my earlier analysis</a>. Metsera offers more than just a few promising drugs in development; it represents a substantial IP platform tied to the <a href=\"https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.bloom\" rel=\"nofollow\">very foundations of GLP-1</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The presentation slide from my previous work about the roots of Metsera:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"903\" data-height=\"429\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Metsera Origin Story <span>(Metsera Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third thought is that we may not be done here yet. Metsera <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4499983-metsera-ultra-long-acting-glp-1-met-097i-excels-mid-stage-trial\">had a successful readout shortly after</a> the Pfizer deal was announced, so there could be some interesting dynamics still to unfold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The analysis continues as originally planned from here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks Update from My Previous Analysis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll go through these one by one, as they were originally laid out back in August.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the primary drivers behind the recent selloff is broad pessimism across the pharmaceutical sector</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering MFN (Most Favored Nation), the threat seems to have somewhat eased recently, thanks to Pfizer and the TrumpRx initiative. Big Pharma has started offering certain drugs directly to consumers, and this approach appears to satisfy the administration—at least for now. The discounts are substantial, reportedly in the 50–80% range, which makes sense, given the direct-to-consumer model that cuts out middlemen like PBMs and pharmacies—various pharma companies have indicated that intermediaries account for roughly 50% of the high list prices currently under debate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From what I’ve briefly checked, the drugs offered by that direct model may not be the top sellers, so by and large, this move provides meaningful relief for pharma companies at the moment. That said, “certainty” isn’t exactly the word of the day in this environment, so it’s important to stay alert on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, that’s not all when it comes to the leaders in the obesity sector, Novo and Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>), as of October 16, according to CNBC:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>During a Thursday press conference, Trump specifically mentioned Ozempic, referring to it as \"the fat loss drug\" when addressing questions about medication pricing. When asked if these drugs would cost $150 out of pocket, Trump stated, \"They’ll be much lower. They’ll be much lower.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s a lot of speculation about what he meant by that statement, and my take is that it could actually be a huge positive—if it turns out to be true.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831279-hims-and-hers-q3-could-provide-volatility-but-the-long-term-vision-remains-bright\">my analysis</a> of Hims &amp; Hers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIMS\" title=\"Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc.\">HIMS</a>):</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>A more plausible scenario than directly forcing manufacturers to sell at $150, which many understand, is that Trump could push to mandate broader coverage of weight-loss drugs within programs like Medicare or Medicaid and cap the patient co-pay at $150. This is certainly a more credible threat than simply forcing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to sell their drug at that low price point, which isn’t realistic in my view.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So makes a lot of sense to keep an eye on that topic in case analysts bring it up during the earnings call.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second major source of pressure is competitive</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here, I think it's appropriate to bring out what I wrote in the last analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic have slightly lower efficacy metrics compared to Eli Lilly and Company's (LLY) blockbusters Mounjaro and Zepbound, leading to some loss of market share. The company cut its guidance on July 29th, citing competitive headwinds, and the stock dropped nearly 22% that same day.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately — and Lilly has been vocal on their side—they're actually more than just slightly better when it comes to efficacy, as laid out by the \"SHAPE\" study, sponsored by Eli Lilly and published in May 2025 in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>A total of 751 participants underwent randomization. The least-squares mean percent change in weight at week 72 was −20.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], −21.4 to −19.1) with tirzepatide and −13.7% (95% CI, −14.9 to −12.6) with semaglutide (P&lt;0.001).</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Actually, a 6.5% difference in real-life efficacy is significant. While the research was commissioned and conducted by Lilly—and should be taken with at least some grain of salt—it still points to something that doesn’t exactly favor Novo. Of course, there are other factors to consider, like side effects and the fact that what works well for one individual might not be ideal for another. But we have to be honest: it does seem like Lilly has an edge here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other than that, Novo and Lilly continue to dominate the obesity market. While there are plenty of contenders, no new entrants are expected in 2026—and even 2027 looks highly unlikely. 2028, however, could be an interesting year, with new competitors potentially trying to enter the space and Novo and Lilly’s own next-generation drug innovations possibly gaining market access as well.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third factor, in my view, is technical</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my previous analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The stock peaked in June 2024, just below $150, and has since started to trend downward. In today's algorithm-driven trading environment, strong and clear trends often become self-reinforcing, driving prices lower regardless of underlying fundamentals.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Without making things too complex, it’s clear to anyone that nothing truly breakthrough-positive has happened technically. The attempt to gain strength above the $60 mark has failed, and we’re now back around the $50 level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1086\" data-height=\"587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Novo Stock Price Chart <span>(FinViz)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the previous analysis Risks chapter, there was one more important point to bring out:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The most material near-term risk for Novo Nordisk is if oral Wegovy fails to secure FDA approval.

I don’t see any strong basis to anticipate a major miss or beat—results are likely to come in more or less in line. What matters more is their outlook, especially given the competitive dynamics: Lilly clearly has an edge and is gaining momentum, while compounders are legally required to interrupt their offerings; as I understand it, they haven’t fully done so yet.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it’s always great to take a step back and calmly consider the less favorable scenarios to avoid mistakes and negative surprises. In Novo’s case, the current price level looks quite compelling in my view—it's as if the market has already done the discounting work for us. Hopefully, we’ll see some positive news in the upcoming earnings release, and the market may begin to price Novo more favorably from here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This is a transformative deal, designed to gain more scale and boost margins<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> after both firms have seen very tough times recently.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal looks good on paper, but investors are not sold on the idea, potentially amidst added uncertainty at a tricky point in time, with both firms employing quite a bit of leverage in relation to minimal current earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, I see potential on paper, driven by ambitious synergy targets, yet a mixed track record of both firms makes me very cautious.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About Ryerson</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ryerson describes its business as a leading distributor and metal solutions' provider across North America. The company generates about $4.6 billion in annual revenues from such products and services, half of which tied to carbon, a quarter to stainless steel and the remainder of aluminum. The company offers some 75,000 products, supplied to about 40,000 customers, across a wide spectrum of industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These solutions are provided from no less than 110 operating locations, which employ some 4,300 workers. Despite a reasonable presence, the company is struggling with its margins, with EBITDA margins reported at just 2.5% of sales over the past year. It should be understood that both margins and sales were down substantially after a boom driven by an economic recovery and inflationary pressures in a post-pandemic era.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates in a highly fragmented market, which is dominated by Reliance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RS\" title=\"Reliance, Inc.\">RS</a>), which reports nearly $14 billion in annual sales. Ryerson claims to be the second player in this market, being much smaller, competing against the likes of Kloeckner, Worthington and also Olympic Steel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company has many plans to improve the business, Ryerson has seen some real struggles as a $3 billion business in 2015 saw sales peak at levels over $6 billion in 2022, with revenues now having fallen to $4.5 billion on a trailing basis. Historically, operating margins have come in anywhere between low single digit margins and high single digit margins, with the business recently even posting losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This painful reversal made that a peak price around $40 per share in 2023 has come down to the low-twenties here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Valuation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside the deal announcement of Olympic, Ryerson <a href=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> third quarter results. Year to date, revenues are down 3% and change to just below $3.5 billion, amidst flattish volumes and falling prices. The company actually managed to increase adjusted EBITDA in a minor way to $118 million, with net losses of $18 million working down to a loss of $0.58 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With 32 million shares trading at $23, a $736 million equity valuation excludes a substantial net debt load of $470 million, for a $1.2 billion pro forma enterprise valuation. This valued the business at just over 0.25 times sales and about 10 times EBITDA, these margins being minimal, and no earnings to show for.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About The Deal</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Facing tougher times, the company has <a href=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-and-Olympic-Steel-Announce-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-and-Olympic-Steel-Announce-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reached</a> an agreement to acquire Olympic Steel as the deal has been labeled as a merger. The transaction is structured as an all-stock-merger with 1.7105 shares of Ryerson offered for every share outstanding in Olympic Steel, with investors in Olympic on a combined basis owning 37% of the share base, suggesting a pro forma share count of 51 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With some 20 million shares issued to investors in Olympic, these were valued at $460 million at $23 per share. Including a $234 million net debt load, the business is valued close to $700 million, implying a valuation close to 0.35 times sales at close to $2.0 billion here. The company is posting adjusted EBITDA close to $70 million per annum, for margins close to 3.5%, minimally higher than the margins reported by Ryerson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pro forma EBITDA is seen around $190 million here, yet the combination operates with about $700 million in net debt, for elevated leverage ratios. The promise of the business is to deliver on $120 million in synergies, equal to 6% of the acquired sales. If this is realistic, EBITDA will increase to $300 million, for a leverage ratio in the low 2s, that is even at current depressed levels of industry profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real impact after taxes is a potential $2 per share accretion number on the bottom line. This however comes amidst tiny losses reported, with both firms posting EBITDA margins at just between 2.5-3.5% of sales here. A near 2% synergy target in relation to pro forma sales looks a bit ambitious, again equal to 6% of added sales.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors Are Not Buying It</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upon the deal announcement, shares have fallen from $23 and change to $21 and change, which makes that including the to be issued shares make for a $100 million decline in the pro forma market valuation here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might come amidst a relatively higher sales multiple offered and fears about dilution for investors in Ryerson. However, this excludes potential synergies, and even as I deem the number to be highly optimistic, even a partial realization of synergies could still make the deal interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In theory, all this should be highly appealing, so the set-up of lower expectations and potential for large synergies looks interesting. However, the reality is that, in my view, two average operators are combined, also considering potential disruption from such a merger. Furthermore, the performance trails that of the absolute market leader Reliance in a huge way.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, the potential of the deal to create value is compelling enough to keep a close eye on the development and achievements of the combined business going forward.</p>",
