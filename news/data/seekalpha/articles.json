Central banks are still buying</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Official sector demand remains the backbone of the gold market. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, central banks, particularly across emerging markets, have accelerated reserve diversification in response to sanctions risk, geopolitical fragmentation and a desire to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Crucially, this demand has proved steady and largely price insensitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland, the world’s largest reported gold buyer last year, has signalled further purchases as it targets a higher absolute level of gold holdings rather than a fixed share of reserves. It is now targeting around 700 tonnes of gold, up from roughly 550 tonnes, rather than a fixed 30% share of reserves. This underscores that reserve accumulation remains strategic, not tactical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China’s central bank also extended its gold buying to a fifteenth month in January. As long as geopolitical fragmentation persists, a meaningful reversal in central bank gold demand looks unlikely. This structural floor continues to underpin the market at elevated price levels.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central bank demand remains resilient</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Central bank demand remains resilient\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: World Gold Council, ING Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Geopolitics back to the forefront</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitical risk has re-emerged as a dominant macro driver. From renewed Middle East tensions to trade frictions and tariff threats, investors are navigating a more uncertain global environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Policy unpredictability, particularly around trade, is increasing volatility across asset classes. Against this backdrop, safe-haven demand remains well supported. Gold’s role as a hedge against geopolitical and policy shocks is once again in focus.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Fed easing could add a tailwind</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A shift in the US monetary policy backdrop could provide an additional tailwind for gold. While the Federal Reserve remains cautious, the balance of risks is gradually tilting towards easing as growth momentum cools and inflation continues to normalise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our US economist expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter, with policy becoming incrementally less restrictive over the coming quarters. Even a modest easing cycle would be supportive for gold, lowering real yields and reducing the opportunity cost of holding non‑yielding assets.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. ETFs showing renewed appetite</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF positioning remains well below the 2020 peak, leaving room for further inflows. After a period of consolidation, gold ETFs are once again attracting investor interest. While central bank buying continues to anchor the market, ETFs have the capacity to amplify price moves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If rate‑cut expectations firm or geopolitical risks intensify, a renewed wave of ETF inflows could provide another leg higher for gold prices. Historically, ETF holdings tend to rise alongside prices and are closely linked to expectations for US monetary policy, reinforcing the case for stronger inflows as the Fed moves towards easier policy.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF flows respond to shifts in Fed policy</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ETF flows respond to shifts in Fed policy\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: US Fed, Refinitiv, ING Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. Digital dollars and reserve evolution</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reserve evolution is no longer confined to central banks. The rapid growth of US dollar-backed stablecoins has created a new institutional buyer of reserve assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stablecoin issuers, most notably <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/tether-is-shaking-up-the-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard\" rel=\"noopener\">Tether</a>, have become significant buyers of reserve assets, including US Treasuries and increasingly gold. Tether alone purchased over 70 tonnes of gold last year, second only to Poland among reported buyers, and now holds around 140 tonnes across its reserves and gold‑backed token.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If gold remains part of this reserve strategy, stablecoin growth could represent an additional structural source of demand, behaving more like central bank buying than retail flows. While still smaller in scale, this channel adds another layer of structural support.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Momentum may slow, but the case for gold remains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The path higher is unlikely to be linear. At record price levels, physical demand is becoming more price sensitive, and periods of consolidation – or short-term corrections – should be expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the structural pillars of this rally – central bank diversification, geopolitical fragmentation, potential policy easing and renewed ETF interest – remain intact. For now, the broader environment continues to favour gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

The thesis followed Michael Burry's disclosure of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> short positions in Nvidia (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and Palantir (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLTR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), labeling AI a \"bubble.\" PKW could hedge this risk by avoiding concentration risk in technology and focusing instead on shareholder return. This strategy proved successful, with PKW returning 6.34% and outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 4% </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">with less volatility</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. The fund focuses on buyback yield, favoring companies that are repurchasing a minimum of 5% of their float.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My only concern was PKW's relatively high total expense ratio (0.62%). Recently, I began looking at other funds that could achieve the same objective and came across the iShares Core Dividend ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVB\" title=\"iShares Core Dividend ETF\">DIVB</a></span>). This fund aims to accomplish the same objective by maximizing the total capital returned to investors via divi<span class=\"highlighted_text\">dends <em>and</em> buyb</span>acks. In other words, it invests in companies with the highest total shareholder return (defined as the buyback yield, plus the dividend yield). It avoids high concentration risk in individual stocks, with Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) being the largest holding. It also does not avoid technology, which is actually the highest-weighted sector. Instead, it favors \"old\" technology companies like Cisco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO\" title=\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\">CSCO</a>), Texas Instruments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TXN\" title=\"Texas Instruments Incorporated\">TXN</a>), and Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a>) that return massive capital flows to their investors. The fund has a lower beta than the overall market (0.88) and a total expense ratio of only 0.05%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, for similar reasons as PKW, I rate DIVB a Buy for investors looking to remove technology risk from their portfolios via a simple, diversified ETF.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>DIVB: The Diversification And Value Edge Vs. The S&amp;P 500</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A major difference between the S&amp;P 500 and DIVB lies not only in which stocks they hold but in why they hold them. As a market capitalization-weighted index, the S&amp;P 500 has become heavy in technology because these have been the best-performing stocks over the course of the current bull market. Information technology has reached around 35% because the more large technology stocks outperform, the higher the resulting weighting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DIVB, on the other hand, gravitates toward companies that return capital to shareholders; defined as the <em>net buyback yield plus dividend yield</em>. Interestingly, this leads to a portfolio composition that's not extremely different from the S&amp;P 500, except for the largest stocks in the index. Most notably, the fund is underweight information technology (24.05%), while it's overweight financials (19.72%) and energy (4.47%).

He believes that the huge spending on chips and data centers has led to understated depreciation. If he is correct, it will lead to pressure on the earnings of big tech in the coming years, pressuring the long-term earnings growth expected by analysts. As I have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870233-great-commoditization-how-to-invest-in-post-ai-world\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870233-great-commoditization-how-to-invest-in-post-ai-world\" target=\"_blank\">previously written</a>, the sheer magnitude of big tech capex spending is breathtaking. It's roughly $700B this year and potentially $1T next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think there's some confusion among investors about the growth that big tech is currently pursuing. <em>Not all growth creates value.</em> There's no question that big tech will see phenomenal revenue growth in the coming years due to AI demand. The question is whether big tech is spending so much today that the discounted value of those cash flows will be insufficient to create value for shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To quote my favorite investor, <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2016620/warren-buffetts-letters-1992\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2016620/warren-buffetts-letters-1992\" target=\"_blank\">Warren Buffett</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Growth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at incremental returns that are enticing—in other words, only when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of long-term market value. In the case of a low-return business requiring incremental funds, grow<span class=\"highlighted_text\">th <em>hurts the investor.</em></span></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, there is substantial risk to investors in big tech. The risk is not that demand for AI will evaporate, and it's not that the companies are overvalued based on a reasonable forecast of cash flow. Rather, the risk is that the huge spending today will eventually generate multiple AI products that will become commoditized. Further, the capex required to fund this growth is extremely high, leading to a pincer attacking the value of cash flow from multiple angles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (via OpenAI and Copilot), and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) (via Anthropic) all profit from AI, there are only two possibilities. One is they all reach roughly the same product, and that product is a commodity. The second is that only a few win, but the rest must lose. Thus, the eventual return on investment for AI is uncertain. It's even possible that the return will become so low that we look back years from now, acknowledging that Burry was correct in his \"bubble\" call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 has become concentrated in a few growth companies to a degree only witnessed in 1929. While the growth promised by AI and modern technology is undeniable, the spending to achieve that growth calls returns into question. Investors should remember Warren Buffett's advice: Growth only creates value when the return on invested capital is high; otherwise, it can ultimately destroy shareholder value. To be clear: I do not present this as a bear thesis for the S&amp;P 500, it's simply a risk that growth-oriented investors are taking. My primary concern about the S&amp;P 500 is that rather than being diversified, the largest companies in it are taking similar risks. This could end well or badly depending on the eventual returns from investment in AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By traditional DCF metrics, the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 appear reasonably valued. However, these businesses are in transition, and investing in them today is a bet that AI will offer sufficient return on capital to create shareholder value. For investors who wish to diversify, the iShares Core Dividend ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVB\" title=\"iShares Core Dividend ETF\">DIVB</a>) offers a highly efficient way to maintain exposure preferentially to companies that are returning capital to shareholders instead of spending it on AI.

Traditional <a href=\"https://www.breakthrought1d.org/daily-management/administering-insulin/#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20primary%20methods,to%20correct%20high%20blood%20sugars.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">insulin delivery systems</a> include subcutaneous methods (injections, pens) that require multiple daily self-administered injections (MDI), which enable both basal and bolus insulin release. Insulin pumps are small devices that contain a continuous supply of insulin through a tiny tube inserted under the skin to deliver both basal and bolus insulin. Finally, we have automated insulin delivery systems. This is the niche in which Insulet operates with its Omnipod products. These are devices that create one comprehensive system, including a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump, and algorithms that automatically manage and adjust insulin delivery in real time. Together, these minimize human error through manual calculations and increase convenience as they don’t need to be self-administered; the whole process is automated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.omnipod.com/simplify/omnipod-5?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=prso-aw&amp;utm_content=pmax-brnd&amp;ctoken=7012J000001gYaiQAE&amp;utm_id=21364100800&amp;ad_group_id=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21353736900&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADzvGq4OIHpEQOgCA0WUrjnhmDe9l&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA7-rMBhCFARIsAKnLKtBEwv7j3GQs4GUobHS9zS0FwvQw8Wr6XZQGEcO1ZsXlzWZSOegoNEwaAlpYEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Omnipod</a> system is a tubeless, waterproof, wearable pod with a complementary app to administer bolus insulin. Similar automated insulin delivery (AID) devices still require patients to calculate carbohydrates in meals to administer bolus insulin before meals. Omnipod facilitates this through their SmartBolus calculator feature in the app, which recommends a dose level, after which patients click confirm, and the system delivers the amount. The pod contains their algorithm, which is paired with CGM systems to automatically adjust and regulate insulin delivery every 5 minutes. What’s unique about this device is its recurring revenue through its almost subscription-like elements. Each pod has a lifespan of 72 hours, creating the need to constantly replace them. The <a href=\"https://investors.insulet.com/news/news-details/2025/Insulet-Announces-FDA-510k-Clearance-of-Omnipod-5-Algorithm-Enhancements-that-Redefine-Insulin-Delivery-and-Simplify-the-Pod-Experience/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">FDA</a> cleared these pods in January 2022 for use in type 1 diabetics aged 2 years and above and type 2 diabetics aged 18 years and above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PODD has 3 primary streams of revenue: US (71%), International (28%), and Drug Delivery (1%). Their US segment accounts for revenues from the sale of Omnipod products (the current Omnipod 5 and legacy Omnipod DASH). The international segment accounts for the sale of Omnipod products across the US border. Finally, their Drug Delivery segment refers to revenues from PODD partnering with other firms to use their tubeless pods to deliver non-insulin drugs. As per their <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/c5bd9e29-b4db-468c-8cad-bb8d3f08960e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10K</a>, they primarily sell pods to Amgen here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings and Financials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/c5bd9e29-b4db-468c-8cad-bb8d3f08960e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earnings</a> blew it out of the park! We saw revenues climb 31% year over year to 783 million. We saw an EPS surprise of over 4%. We saw international Omnipod revenue grow over 50% year over year, showing us how their international expansion represents a real long-term growth opportunity, as I’ll discuss later in this report. The main takeaways from the earnings were that it reflects the underpenetrated international market and the massive opportunity it represents, the exploding adoption of Omnipod 5 and its mass appeal as a leading tubeless AID insulin pump, and the authorization of a 300 million share repurchase program. The company generated a 24% increase in FCF on a year-on-year basis, and there’s a massive runway for further value creation to shareholders as demonstrated by this buyback program. Moreover, their current ratio, at 2.81, reflects high liquidity and more than solid coverage of short-term obligations. Their total debt level of $949 million, implying a d/e ratio of 0.63x, is well covered by $716 million in cash. Insulet boasts strong margin expansion driven by the success of Omnipod 5 and its launch in international markets. We’ve seen a +184 bps increase in gross margins from 2024 to 71.6%, well above their peers of Medtronic plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDT\" title=\"Medtronic plc\">MDT</a>) (65%) and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TNDM\" title=\"Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.\">TNDM</a>) (54%). Furthermore, their operating margin has grown by +54 bps to 15.5%. The decline in net profit margin is driven by a one-time non-operating expense (loss on extinguishment of debt) and a normalized tax expense as opposed to the tax benefit received previously. The underlying business demonstrates great growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industry and Competitive Dynamics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://diabetesatlas.org/resources/idf-diabetes-atlas-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Currently</a>, the adult population (people aged 20-79 years) of diabetics has reached almost 600 million and is expected to grow by 45% to over 850 million by 2050.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"432\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IDF Adult Population Diabetes Projected Growth (2050)\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IDF Adult Population Diabetes Projected Growth <span>(International Diabetes Federation (IDF)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of this, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for over <a href=\"https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/\" rel=\"nofollow\">90%</a> of all diabetes cases worldwide.

Medtronic is the largest company and has captured the majority of the market with its MiniMed 780G (released in 2023), having captured <a href=\"https://www.marketreportsworld.com/market-reports/insulin-pump-market-14716747#:~:text=Top%20Two%20Companies%20with%20Highest,contribute%20to%20its%20growing%20adoption.\" rel=\"nofollow\">36%</a> of the insulin pump market. However, PODD has positioned itself as the best all-encompassing product in the market with Omnipod 5’s tubeless nature, CGM, automated insulin adjustment algorithm, and app-based control and deployment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insulet’s market share of the insulin pump market exceeds 25%, and it continues to aggressively steal market share from the competition. The market is concerned with the future competitive landscape of the pump market, as in the near term (early 2026), Tandem is coming out with Tubeless Mobi, a tubeless AID device with a product lifespan of 7 days compared to Omnipod 5’s 3-day lifespan. After this, Tandem hopes to launch Sigi, a 7-day, tubeless AID device that seeks to differentiate itself and capture market share for its rechargeable capability. Moreover, Medtronic is set to submit its own tubeless model for FDA approval in late 2026. The threat here lies in Medtronic’s deep pockets, considering it is a much larger company with an almost $130 billion market cap, a massive installed base, and prior relationships, which would allow it to recapture market share if successful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insulet responds by developing Omnipod 6, currently enrolled in trial phases, and <a href=\"https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/insulet-investor-day-omnipod-6-2027/#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20fully%20enrolled,advanced%20technology%2C%E2%80%9D%20Benjamin%20said.\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a> to submit by the end of 2026 and launch in 2027. They release the results of their trials at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2026 conference. Given Omnipod 5's strong clinical performance, boasting <a href=\"https://www.omnipod.com/hcp/c/outcomes\" rel=\"nofollow\">80%</a> Time in Range (TIR), I expect Omnipod 6 to reflect similarly strong trials given its adaptive AI learning algorithm. Furthermore, their fully closed-loop device is in the early clinical stage, set to launch in 2028. There are 3 primary pump types: open loop, fully user-controlled; hybrid closed loop, automated with the occasional need for user input; and closed loop, fully automated. Insulet and the majority of its competitors are hybrid-closed loop, in that they fully automate basal insulin doses based on glucose trends reflected in the CGM; however, they require users to manually program bolus insulin dose amounts based on the carb count of their meals. Insulet’s SmartBolus Calculator recommends a bolus dose amount based on user-input data to facilitate the process, and once accepted, it administers the dose.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Market is Overstating the Impact of GLP-1s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glucagon Like Peptides (GLP-1)</a> drugs are a class of medication that help manage blood sugar (glucose) levels in people with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that your small intestine produces: triggering insulin from the pancreas, blocking glucagon secretion, and satiating oneself. These drugs aren’t yet FDA-approved to treat type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune condition that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Once destroyed, these cells are not replaced. Conversely, type 2 diabetes still has insulin-producing cells that do so, but in fact, they become resistant to it. Therefore, GLP-1 drugs have no impact on treating type 1 diabetes, as they enhance insulin secretion, but type 1 diabetics suffer from the body destroying their own insulin-producing beta cells.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market <a href=\"https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/analyst-comment/glp-1-medications-diabetic-devices-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\">believes</a> that the emergence of GLP-1 and SGLT2 inhibitors poses a direct threat to insulin delivery devices, with shares in the past dropping almost 12% <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698698-insulet-insulin-pump-provider-fighting-back-after-torrid-2023\">because of GLP-1 news</a>, but is overstating this impact. There is a fundamental misalignment between what it believes the relationship between GLP-1s and insulin delivery devices is and what the reality of the situation is. GLP-1s cannot effectively treat type 1 diabetes, and PODD serves a customer base of predominantly <a href=\"https://matrixbcg.com/blogs/target-market/insulet#:~:text=The%20primary%20customer%20segments%20for,Direct%2Dto%2DConsumer%20Model\" rel=\"nofollow\">type 1 diabetics</a>. Moreover, within their type 2 diabetes customer base, they target exclusively individuals placed on intensive insulin therapy. These patients require multiple daily injections (MDI) and are beyond the point where GLP-1s alone would be effective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"816\" data-height=\"558\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T2D Patient Journey\" width=\"640\" height=\"438\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PODD Targets T2D Patients Placed on Intensive Insulin Therapy <span>(Northern Light Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The emergence of GLP-1s doesn't place any direct threat to Insulet’s current customer base (T1D patients and T2D patients placed on intensive insulin therapy). One may think, “Ok, it doesn’t affect their current market, but won’t GLP-1s reduce the number of patients that reach the point where they need intensive insulin therapy, and therefore reduce the future market size?” I argue the contrary; industry experts such as <a href=\"https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/analysts-glp-1s-minor-impact-insulin-pump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dr. Osama Hamdy</a> have elucidated that GLP-1s complement the insulin delivery devices industry, increasing the need for constant glucose monitors (CGMs). With Omnipod being one of the best quality, all-encompassing tools on the market, integrated with CGM, bolus insulin administering app with their SmartBolus Calculator feature, and convenience (through a waterproof feature, being tubeless, and being small), it creates sticky demand as new customers will favor Omnipod 5 over others in the market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insulet’s International Expansion Focus Represents Untapped Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PODD’s international segments currently account for almost <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/c5bd9e29-b4db-468c-8cad-bb8d3f08960e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">30%</a> of revenue. <a href=\"https://investors.insulet.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Historically</a>, this segment has had little to no revenue growth until <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/722ce3e1-5363-4e81-8218-2556789ba894.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023</a>. In <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/32ac37c2-1597-473b-830c-4317b91b64e6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2024</a>, we saw international revenue growth outpace US Omnipod revenue by over 7% (28% vs 21%), and it has upheld that trend in the following quarters. This reflects the existence of a time lag between when Omnipod 5 first launched in international markets and when the growth materialized into a contribution to top-line growth. Omnipod 5 has only just launched in European markets, arriving in <a href=\"https://investor.insulet.com/news/news-details/2023/Insulet-Announces-Full-Market-Release-of-Omnipod-5-Automated-Insulin-Delivery-System-in-Germany/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Germany</a> and the UK in 2023, and since then has expanded into <a href=\"https://investors.insulet.com/news/news-details/2025/Insulet-Launches-Revolutionary-Omnipod-5-in-Five-More-Countries-in-Europe/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Omnipod%205%20Automated%20Insulin,Finland%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Sweden.\" rel=\"nofollow\">9 countries</a>. What I find interesting is that this is an active expansion; it’s ongoing, with them bringing Omnipod 5 to various other countries in 2026 and expanding focus into the <a href=\"https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/insulet-launches-omnipod-5-omnipod-discover-in-the-middle-east/#:~:text=Insulet%20launches%20Omnipod%205%2C%20Omnipod,it%20can%20pair%20with%20G7.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Middle East</a>. Having just entered many European nations as recently as March 2025, I expect to see great growth trends. My thesis lies in the opportunity that the Europe and Middle East expansion represents. As mentioned earlier, the majority of PODD’s revenue comes from type 1 diabetics, and Europe has the highest population of type 1 diabetics, and it's growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"764\" data-height=\"380\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T1D Population Around the World\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T1D Population Around the World <span>(International Diabetes Federation (IDF)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the MENA region, as portrayed by the graph earlier, represents the second-largest addressable market, with the diabetes population forecasted to grow 92% by 2050. This will drive further TAM expansion from their current $30 billion level.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">T2D Market is Underpenetrated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global diabetes is expected to grow <a href=\"https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">46%</a> by 2050. 90% of the diabetic population are Type 2 diabetics. However, the T2D market is quite underpenetrated, with extremely low <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2023.2205795#d1e203\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">5%</a> adoption rates for insulin pumps. This 5% rate is projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/insulin-pump-market-102735\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">15%</a> by 2027. Insulet is set to see the largest gains from this based on two key factors: their structural moat as the best tubeless AID device on the market and their distribution channel strategy. Their moat lies in the fact that they're the most <a href=\"https://www.usmed.com/best-insulin-pumps/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">prominent</a> tubeless devices on the market, and their tubeless nature makes them less visible and more discreet. Moreover, most of their major competitors rely on traditional paths where insulin pumps are distributed through Durable Medical Equipment (DME) channels. This is often a <a href=\"https://www.breakthrought1d.org/t1d-resources/insurance/issues-around-insulin-pumps/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">complex</a> and heavily regulated path, which brings along a lot of paperwork, security, and insurance guidelines. Additionally, this model typically locks consumers into a large, long-term contract wherein they pay a high upfront cost to use the product. However, Insulet benefits from being the first in the market to establish the pay-as-you-go model in which consumers pay for pods as needed, rather than being fixed into long-term contracts. This makes Omnipod 5 a more affordable and more convenient option, setting Insulet to lead the T2D penetration. Insulet’s historically high FCF margins also demonstrate a wide runway for reinvestment into R&amp;D and developing their fully closed-loop devices aimed specifically at providing complete AID devices for people with T2D.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The largest risk the market remains cautious of is the competitive landscape. As mentioned earlier, Tandem is coming out with Tubeless Mobi, with a superior product lifespan of 7 days compared to Omnipod 5’s 3-day lifespan, as well as Sigi, unique for its rechargeable capability. Medtronic is set to submit its own tubeless model for FDA approval in late 2026, which, if approved, poses a major threat with its deeper pockets, massive installed base, and prior relationships, allowing MDT to recapture market share if successful. Furthermore, their success does require continued conversion of patients on MDI and competing pump systems. Delays in FDA approval, technical challenges, or slower-than-expected clinician adoption could also hinder revenue growth (regulatory clearance of enhancements to Omnipod 5 and the planned launch of Omnipod 6).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based solely on comparable company analysis, the stock seems to be trading at a higher relative valuation, which, at face value, may seem indicative of overvaluation. However, I argue that this represents the premium investors are willing to pay for the stock for the expected future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"228\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Comps Table of PODD\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Comps Table of PODD <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve created a comprehensive financial model with revenue build, operating model, and supporting schedules, all of which plug into a DCF, which indicates an implied share price of $330, suggesting a +35% upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642435205_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"820\" data-height=\"164\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642435205_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sensitivity Table at 1.5%-3.5% PGR &amp;

Additionally, this thought process was based on the fact that there is strong competition in the US markets in the near future, with various firms, as discussed earlier, expanding their AID market footprint, which I believe would eventually lead to a slight decline in ASP in order to stay competitive and compete with the behemoth that is MDT. I did, however, forecast this to normalize eventually into a 70/30 US/International revenue mix. Moreover, my assumptions were driven by the idea that PODD’s future sales are a reflection of a stable, growing installed base rather than episodic sales. I forecast end-of-period (EOP) installed base to grow at an aggressive CAGR of almost 20%, driven by the broader market appeal Omnipod 5 generates as an all-encompassing tubeless AID device, T2D penetration, and international expansion. The output is based on an 8.92% WACC and a 2.5% PGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"769\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PODD Revenue Build\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PODD Revenue Build <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all that is discussed in this report, I believe Insulet is a buy with a 12-month price target of $330, representing 35% upside. GLP-1 concerns are exaggerated, with Insulet’s core customer base of T1D and T2D patients on intensive insulin therapy unaffected. International expansion and shifting focus into the Middle East represent strong growth prospects (with +50% YoY growth). The T2D market is still underpenetrated, giving PODD a large runway for growth, with pump adoption expected to triple to 15% by 2027. The 2026 ADA conference will be something to look out for as a near-term catalyst, as well as the continued success of international growth driven by active European market expansion. At an 8.92% WACC and 2.5% PGR, my DCF reflects a $330 implied share price backed by reasonable assumptions. The growth has only just begun.</p>",

This results in an equally weighted portfolio of 125 well-established U.S. securities. The Index is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly, based on technical factors.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fourth quarter of 2025 continued the prevailing bullish trend that had been in place for U.S. equities since October 2022. However, and more importantly for investors, the fourth quarter provided continued evidence of a healthier investing environment relative to the narrower market opportunities of the prior two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Often underappreciated is the calmness on display in the U.S. corporate and government debt markets. During the fourth quarter, the U.S. 10-year Treasury traded neatly in a range between 3.93% and 4.20%, despite a U.S. government shutdown. Supported by two 25 basis point rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the cost of capital continued trending lower with a modest improvement in the availability of credit. Emerging markets debt, municipal bonds, high yield, and investment grade debt all posted gains in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the emerging markets and developed international equity markets, the fourth quarter of 2025 was the exclamation point on a year of relative outperformance to the U.S. The Nikkei 225 Index advanced 12% in the fourth quarter, contributing to developed international equities outperforming the U.S. Strong equity performance in Korea, Taiwan, and China contributed to similar outperformance, relative to the U.S., for emerging markets equities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Corporate earnings continued to anchor the secular bull market for U.S. equities. During the fourth quarter, the S&amp;P 500® Index ('SPX') posted 13.2% earnings growth and 8.3% revenue growth. Ten of the 11 major SPX sectors witnessed positive earnings growth, with only energy down a modest 1.7%. Technology, financials, and materials all recorded double-digit earnings growth. SPX profit margins rose to another new all-time high at 14%, blunting the effect of global tariffs with SPX companies' ability to absorb tariff costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Value outperformed growth for SPX companies in the fourth quarter, led by a resurgence for health care, the best performing SPX sector during the quarter. Precious and base metals had parabolic advances to new all-time highs, which supported the earnings of the materials sector. Lower crude oil prices supported consumers and goods producers, with spot crude oil ending 2025 at $57.42, its lowest annual average price since 2020.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How the Fund Performed</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance was in line with the Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum Index throughout the quarter, with nominal tracking error. For the quarter, JOET posted a total return of -1.56% at NAV versus the Index's return of -1.49%. For comparative purposes, the S&amp;P 500® Index returned 2.66%, while the S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Index returned 1.39%. For the one-year period, JOET posted a total return of 12.10% at NAV versus the Index's return of 12.49%. For comparative purposes, the S&amp;P 500® Index returned 17.88% over the same period, while the S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Index returned 11.43%.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>4Q25</th> <th>1-Year</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum Index</td> <td>-1.49%</td> <td>12.49%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MSCI USA Momentum Index</td> <td>-1.46%</td> <td>17.34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MSCI USA Quality Index</td> <td>4.07%</td> <td>15.88%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Virtus Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JOET\" title=\"Virtus Terranova US Quality Momentum ETF\">JOET</a></span>)</td> <td>-1.56%</td> <td>12.10%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>S&amp;P 500 Index</td> <td>2.66%</td> <td>17.88%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index</td> <td>1.39%</td> <td>11.43%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nasdaq Composite® Index</td> <td>2.72%</td> <td>21.14%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Allocation Effect</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Sector allocation was a detractor from performance over the quarter, relative to the broader market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index.</li> <li>Top absolute contributors to performance were the consumer discretionary, materials, and consumer staples sectors.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Please visit <a href=\"https://virtus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Home Page</a> for performance data current to the most recent month end.</p> <p>The fund class gross expense ratio is 0.29%.</p> <p>The Total Expense Ratio represents the Fund's Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses, which includes the management fee and other expenses where applicable, except for certain payments that are paid directly by the Fund, as described in the Prospectus.</p> <p>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (\"ETF\"). The \"net asset value\" ('NAV') of the Fund is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the Fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the Fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV of the Fund is not necessarily the same as its intraday trading value. Fund investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV because shares of ETFs such as the Fund are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Thus, shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. NAV returns are calculated using the Fund's daily 4:00 p.m. NAV, and include the reinvestment of all dividends and other distributions (reinvested at the Fund's NAV on distribution ex-date). Market price returns are calculated using the 4:00 pm closing price, and include the reinvestment of all dividends and other distributions (reinvested at the closing price on distribution ex-date). Prior to January 1, 2026, the market price returns were calculated using the 4:00 pm midpoint between the bid and offer prices. Market price returns do not represent the return you would receive if you traded at other times.</p> <p>Index <sup>1</sup>: The Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum Index is an equally weighted index designed to provide diversified exposure to quality momentum large-cap equities listed in the United States. The index is calculated on a total return basis with dividends reinvested. Index <sup>2</sup>: The S&amp;P 500® Index is a free-float market capitalization-weighted index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies. The indexes are calculated on a total return basis with dividends reinvested. Index <sup>3</sup>: The S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Index is an equal-weighted index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies. The index is calculated on a total return basis with dividends reinvested.</p> <p>The MSCI USA Momentum Index is designed to capture the performance of an equity momentum strategy by emphasizing stocks with high price momentum. The MSCI USA Quality Index is designed to capture the performance of quality growth stocks by identifying stocks with high quality scores based on high return on equity ('ROE'), stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage. The Nasdaq Composite® Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that tracks all securities listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The S&amp;P MidCap 400® Index is a free-float market-capitalization weighted index of 400 mid-cap U.S. companies that measures the performance of the mid-cap segment of the market. The index is calculated on a total return basis with dividends reinvested. The Russell 2000® Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell Universe, which comprises the 3,000 largest U.S. companies. The index is calculated on a total return basis with dividends reinvested. The indices are unmanaged, their returns do not reflect any fees, expenses, or sales charges, and are not available for direct investment.</p> <p>Tracking Error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark.</p> <p>IOPV, or Indicative Optimized Portfolio Value, is a calculation disseminated by the stock exchange that approximates the Fund's NAV every fifteen seconds throughout the trading day.</p> <p>Notes on Risk: Exchange-Traded Funds ('ETF'): The value of an ETF may be more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities it is designed to track. The costs to the portfolio of owning shares of an ETF may exceed the cost of investing directly in the underlying securities. Large-sized companies may enhance that risk. Equity Securities: The market price of equity securities may be adversely affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small, medium, or large-sized companies may enhance that risk. Momentum Factor Investing: Momentum investing is subject to the risk that the securities may be more volatile than the market as a whole. There may be periods when the momentum style of investing is out of favor and therefore, the investment performance of the portfolio may suffer. Passive Strategy/Index Risk: A passive investment strategy seeking to track the performance of the underlying index may result in the portfolio holding securities regardless of market conditions or their current or projected performance. This could cause the portfolio's returns to be lower than if the portfolio employed an active strategy. Market Price/NAV: At the time of purchase and/or sale, an investor's shares may have a market price that is above or below the fund's NAV, which may increase the investor's risk of loss. Correlation to Index: The performance of the portfolio and its index may vary due to factors such as flows, transaction costs, whether the portfolio obtains every security in the index, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index. Market Volatility: The value of the securities in the portfolio may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies and/or general economic conditions. Local, regional, or global events such as war or military conflict, terrorism, pandemic, or recession could impact the portfolio, including hampering the ability of the portfolio's manager(s) to invest its assets as intended.

He argued that for NVIDIA's customers, compute is no longer a cost center, but <em>a revenue generator</em>. Because of \"token monetization,\" every dollar spent on a Blackwell or Rubin rack directly translates to the ability to sell AI tokens (inference). He noted that \"the <em>cash issues</em> will be resolved by the <em>cash flows</em> of AI factories being much better than expected.\"</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Now, Jensen is first and foremost an innovator, but he’s also a salesman.

Notice in the chart below that the stock—trading at $190 as of this writing—may be poised to finally close above a key range dating back to November 10. The stock still has work to do, and the Friday (weekly) settle will be even more important. But should we get the breakout, then a measured move upside price objective of about $222 would be in play—just below my intrinsic value target.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph. It, like price, has been range bound. A share-price rally paired with an RSI breakout is what we want to see. The long-term 200-day moving average, meanwhile, remains on the rise, suggesting that the bulls control the primary trend. The stock did hit $207 right after the earnings report, while the all-time high of $212 is near-term resistance. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Assuming a breakout, $196 would become support (former resistance becomes new support).

Stocks in the IT and communication services sectors remained central to index performance as investors continued to reward companies positioned to capture outsized demand from the buildout of artificial intelligence ('AI')—particularly those showing business momentum and pricing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The year was also a reminder that markets can “climb a wall of worry” even when policy headlines are destabilizing. Early spring delivered the most dramatic test: The White House’s April 2 “Liberation Day” action jolted risk assets, reviving trade-war fears and forcing investors to reconsider inflation and margin assumptions. Over time, the tariff story became more iterative, marked by pauses and modifications that reduced the immediate sense of worst-case outcomes even as it remained a persistent overhang in corporate and consumer sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentals ultimately mattered more than headlines. Earnings tied to end markets with strong demand—especially AI—proved resilient, helping offset macroeconomic crosscurrents that ranged from trade policy and politics to immigration debates and gradually cooling labor markets. At the consumer level, conditions looked increasingly uneven: Higher-income households continued to spend, while middle- and lower-income cohorts showed clearer signs of trade-down behavior amid ongoing affordability pressure. Against that backdrop, market breadth improved episodically, but overall performance remained heavily influenced by a concentrated set of large-cap winners—an important context for assessing the outlook as we move forward.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shifting leadership</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI was a key economic driver in 2025, and leadership broadened within the AI complex. What began as a narrow story dominated by a handful of mega-cap winners increasingly expanded into the infrastructure “picks and shovels” that enable AI deployment—spanning semiconductors, networking, data-center components, and adjacent software ecosystems. That evolution helped reinforce the market’s preference for companies able to convert AI enthusiasm into measurable bookings, backlog, and operating leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, leadership outside the mega caps was more sensitive to rates and liquidity. As the Federal Reserve (Fed) shifted toward easing in September, risk appetite broadened and participation improved—most visibly in smaller-cap and more cyclically oriented areas. However, the quality of those rallies was mixed as some of the strongest upside phases were led by lower-quality and unprofitable companies, underscoring the difference between liquidity-driven beta surges and fundamentally supported returns. In our view, that distinction became one of the most important “fault lines” in the market and a key lens for evaluating opportunities into 2026.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-end cyclical rotation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fourth quarter added fresh complexity to an already eventful year. Investor attention turned more intensely to the scale, timing, and funding of AI-related capital commitments, prompting renewed debate about whether expectations were running ahead of eventual monetization. This scrutiny contributed to another rotation away from the more crowded AI exposures and toward more cyclical and value-oriented positioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macroeconomic uncertainty also rose during the quarter as the U.S. government shutdown disrupted portions of the data flow and added noise to near-term growth tracking. By late in the quarter, however, markets leaned back toward optimism as the shutdown ended and the Fed’s December messaging reinforced the easing trajectory that began in September, supporting a rebound in broader risk appetite into year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, most major U.S. equity indexes finished the fourth quarter higher while style leadership shifted: Value outperformed growth, reflecting the rotation away from the AI complex into more cyclical positions. The Russell 1000 Value Index returned 3.81% during the quarter, outperforming the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s return of 1.12% by nearly 270 basis points (bps; 100 bps equal 1.00%).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund performance and attribution</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Contributors and Detractors to Quarter-End Fund Performance</h3> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CONTRIBUTORS</h4> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

The recent quarter was a milestone for Teva Pharmaceuticals. Teva previously faced headwinds from declining generic sales and debt from past acquisitions. In early 2023, the company appointed a new CEO, marking a pivotal leadership change aimed at stabilizing operations, improving profitability, and reigniting growth. Under its “pivot to growth” strategy, Teva has expanded its biosimilars portfolio and strengthened its generics business, returning that segment to positive growth. However, the real engine of performance lies in Teva’s internally developed specialty medicines—AUSTEDO, AJOVY, and UZEDY—which are delivering robust revenue gains as adoption accelerates. In the latest quarter, Teva exceeded revenue expectations and achieved meaningful cost efficiencies, prompting Standard &amp; Poor’s to upgrade its credit rating. We believe that with a growing pipeline of innovative treatments, disciplined financial management, and increasing market penetration, Teva is well positioned as a leading player in the global biopharmaceutical industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carpenter Technology Corp. ('CRS') is prepared for lift-off. The company manufactures premium metal alloys used in highly specialized components across aerospace, medical, and industrial markets. While this diversification provides business stability, our investment thesis focuses on the significant replacement cycle in aerospace—a sector that has faced years of underinvestment and production delays. The post-pandemic surge in air travel has led airlines to keep aging fleets in service longer, driving higher maintenance needs. This has boosted demand for Carpenter’s suite of specialty bearings, fasteners, and electrical components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Producing these advanced alloys is both complex and capital-intensive, giving Carpenter strong pricing power—a fact underscored this quarter as multiple long-term contracts were repriced favorably. With robust product demand and expanding margins, we remain confident in Carpenter’s long-term growth prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Natera, Inc. ('NTRA'), is transforming cancer care. A molecular diagnostics company, Natera specializes in three main areas of health care: women’s health, oncology, and organ health. The women’s health division has dominant market share in noninvasive prenatal testing market, generating wide margins that have fueled innovation across other segments. Leveraging in-house expertise, Natera developed Signatera, a liquid biopsy that detects minimal residual disease and can identify cancer recurrence months before traditional methods. The blood-based test currently holds FDA and Medicare approvals for a modest number of cancer types, yet adoption has surged as doctors embrace the minimally invasive approach and early detection capabilities. With additional approvals pending, Natera is investing heavily to drive awareness and volumes in 2026. Backed by cutting-edge technology and a vast underpenetrated market, Natera, we believe, is well-positioned to transform cancer care for years to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Discussion of Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI concerns dented Commvault Systems, Inc. ('CVLT'). Commvault specializes in cyber security, housing complete backups of operating systems that provide companies with the opportunity to revert to prior versions in the event of cyberattacks. Once known for legacy backup solutions, Commvault has successfully pivoted toward subscription-based and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. However, the recent quarter produced mixed financial results with positive new business growth yet contracting profit margins. Despite management signaling confidence in future execution, the rise of AI has caused intense scrutiny on potential disruption in the software industry. As a result, shares of Commvault sold off over the profitability concerns. Given heightened volatility and deteriorating visibility, we exited the position in favor of higher-conviction opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Varonis Systems, Inc. ('VRNS'), struggled to transform. Varonis specializes in data security software that helps organizations manage access controls and permissions across sensitive files and applications. Like many software peers, Varonis has aggressively shifted from on-premises solutions to a SaaS-first model. While cloud adoption has accelerated and now represents nearly three-quarters of revenue, the company has struggled to convert existing on-premise clients. Term license renewals plunged during the quarter and maintenance revenue fell by almost 50%, reflecting churn among legacy clients. The company trimmed full-year revenue guidance after these execution challenges along with a weaker outlook for federal government contracts. Considering these headwinds, our sell discipline was triggered as the fundamental thesis became challenged.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adtalem Global Education Inc. ('ATGE') had a weak report card.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adtalem is a leading education provider with top-tier health care universities, including Chamberlain University —the largest nursing degree provider in the U.S.—as well as several medical and veterinary programs. During the quarter, the company reported strong growth in revenue and reaffirmed full-year guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, shares came under pressure when management flagged operational execution issues in its largest segment and announced leadership changes to improve oversight, signaling concern over future enrollment trajectory. In light of this, we exited our position in favor of higher-conviction opportunities.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund positioning and outlook</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two big narratives</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For U.S. equity investors, 2025 will be remembered for two key themes. First, AI continued to seize the spotlight. A super cycle of AI-related investments, which many expected to cool, went into higher gear. The arms race for computing power and infrastructure contributed to prolonged market concentration around leading large-cap technology stocks. The notion that AI would transcend into a broader subset of sectors was largely delayed. Despite the excitement, the year ended with concerns of a potential AI bubble driven by large “circular deals,” rising levels of both public and private debt, and a change in leadership for the market’s favored AI complex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second major theme of the year was around leadership from low-quality “non-earners.” “Risk-on” speculation was on the rise, largely driven by fading trade-war fears and an expectation of significant policy stimulus in 2026. The Fed was expected to continue to cut rates and shift in a dovish direction. Additionally, stimulative impacts from the One Big Beautiful Bill were expected to be a tailwind to economic growth.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quality growth on sale</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These factors contributed to the year ending with a divergence in market leadership. Value-oriented and economically sensitive stocks rallied in the fourth quarter, with higher-quality growth stocks generally lagging. The low-quality momentum, which was previously driven by themes like crypto and quantum computing, continued in the fourth quarter but with a different complexion. The darlings of retail traders shifted to commodities, transports, and speculative names in biotechnology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This speculation resulted in some high-quality growth businesses going on sale. Sitting outside the current zeitgeist, there was a narrowing of the valuation premium awarded to companies that can grow sustainably at faster rates. Based on our experience, this setup is often favorable for future returns. When elite growth franchises de-rate on sentiment factors, compelling entry points can emerge. As the influence of sentiment diminishes over time, the underlying growth of the business reemerges as the dominant driver of returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With some portfolio holdings going unrewarded for exceptional fundamental results, we are excited at the prospects of strong future returns for these exceptional businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Along the same lines, we remain excited about the emergence of small- and mid-cap equities. While market broadening took on a start/stop pattern, we expect a more sustained leadership shift in 2026. The setup for small- and mid-cap growth stocks remains highly favorable. Relative valuations are historically attractive, earnings growth is expected to close in on large caps, AI-related opportunities are broadening, corporate activity is picking up, and stimulative policy effects are in the system. The stars may be aligning for a period of healthy performance beyond the mega caps dominating U.S. equity benchmarks.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Scarcity of growth</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We continue to have high conviction in the scarcity of growth. Unlike the consensus view that economic growth is about to reaccelerate, our view is that growth will remain at modest levels. From the bigger picture, we see structural forces compressing economic output. With only a small number of companies in U.S. equity benchmarks expected to deliver strong future earnings growth, companies with robust fundamentals will remain in short supply. This should benefit quality growth stocks as investors reward companies with sustainable fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In closing, our approach is to remain highly disciplined. Rather than chasing short-term speculation, our focus is on identifying the true long-term winners of innovation such as AI, many of which will soon emerge beyond the infrastructure phase. We execute this strategy through stock selection, balanced portfolio construction, and a thoughtful approach to risk management. With economic growth slowing while technological disruption accelerates, focusing on resilient growth businesses on the “right side of change”—one company at a time—remains the cornerstone of our strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Rather than chasing short-term speculation, our focus is on identifying the true long-term winners of innovation such as AI, many of which will soon emerge beyond the infrastructure phase.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Calculated based on a one-year period.</li> <li>Calculated for the Institutional Class based on a three-year period.

Funds via the top navigation.</p> <p>Portfolio holdings and characteristics are subject to change and may have changed since the date specified. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security.</p> <p>Benchmark Descriptions:</p> <p>The Russell 2500™ Growth Index measures the performance of those Russell 2500 companies with higher price/book ratios and higher forecasted growth values. You cannot invest directly in an index.</p> <p>The Russell 1000® Value Index measures the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with lower price/book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. You cannot invest directly in an index.</p> <p>The Russell 1000® Growth Index measures the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with higher price/book ratios and higher forecasted growth values. You cannot invest directly in an index.</p> <p>The Lipper averages are compiled by Lipper, Inc., an independent mutual fund research and rating service. Each Lipper average represents a universe of funds that are similar in investment objective. You cannot invest directly in a Lipper average.</p> <p>The Morningstar Category average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group. The total return of the Morningstar Category average does not include the effect of sales charges. You cannot invest directly in a Morningstar Category average.</p> <p>Diversification does not ensure or guarantee better performance and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses.</p> <p>Attribution Analysis:</p> <p>Performance attribution and sector returns are calculated using the Brinson-Fachler attribution model. As such, performance attribution calculations may differ from the fund's actual investment results. Common sources of attribution dispersion from official returns include: the use of end of day holdings and prices, the exclusion of fees, and the use of myriad pricing sources to accommodate different benchmark providers.</p> <p>Definition of Terms:</p> <p>Active share of an account is calculated by subtracting a portfolio's overlap with its performance benchmark from 100%. The portfolio-level overlap compares parent-level weights between positions held in both the portfolio and benchmark, summing the lesser of such weights.</p> <p>Alpha measures the difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of risk (as measured by beta).</p> <p>Beta measures fund volatility relative to general market movements. It is a standardized measure of systematic risk in comparison with a specified index. The benchmark beta is 1.00 by definition.</p> <p>Downside capture measures a fund's replication of its benchmark during periods of negative returns. During periods of negative benchmark returns, a downside capture ratio less than 100% reflects product performance greater than the benchmark and a downside capture ratio greater than 100% reflects performance less than the benchmark.</p> <p>Information ratio measures the consistency of excess return (return in excess of a benchmark). This value is determined by taking the annualized excess return over a benchmark (style benchmark by default) and dividing it by the standard deviation of excess return.</p> <p>Long-term growth forecast is the annual earnings-per-share growth that the company can sustain over the next 3 or 5 years based on Allspring estimate data.</p> <p>Price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) uses long-term earnings growth estimates. The long-term earnings growth is the annual earnings-per-share growth that the company can sustain over the next 3 or 5 years based on estimate data.</p> <p>R-squared is a measurement of how similar a fund's historical performance has been to that of the benchmark. The measure ranges from 0.0, which means that the fund's performance bears no relationship to the performance of the index, to 1.0, which means that the fund's performance was perfectly synchronized with the performance of the benchmark.</p> <p>Sharpe ratio measures the potential reward offered by a mutual fund relative to its risk level. The ratio uses a fund's standard deviation and its excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the fund's historical risk-adjusted performance.</p> <p>Standard deviation represents the degree to which an investment's performance has varied from its average performance over a particular time period.</p> <p>Tracking error measures the extent to which a manager's performance mimics that of a benchmark. The value is the standard deviation of the difference between a fund's performance and a benchmark's performance.</p> <p>Upside capture measures a fund's replication of its benchmark during periods of positive returns. During periods of positive benchmark returns, an upside capture ratio greater than 100% reflects product performance greater than the benchmark and an upside capture ratio less than 100% reflects performance less than the benchmark.</p> <p>Risks: Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Stock values fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Smaller company stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than those of larger companies. Consult the fund's prospectus for additional information on these and other risks.</p> <p>The Morningstar Rating for funds, or star rating, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.</p> <p>Across U.S.-domiciled mid-cap growth funds, the SMID Cap Growth Fund received 3 stars among 472 funds, 1 star among 446 funds, and 2 stars among 371 funds for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively. The Morningstar Rating is for the Institutional Class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.</p> <p>The Morningstar absolute ranking is based on the fund's total return rank relative to all funds that have the same category for the same time period. Morningstar rankings do not include the effect of sales charges. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</p> <p>© 2026 Morningstar. All rights reserved.

Since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4842946-vpu-ai-infrastructure-drive-capital-deployment-and-new-ppas\">previous coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> last November, the fund delivered a 5.8% total return, and I believe that VPU has the potential of up to 10% further gains. My previous article highlighted that the inconsistency between the artificial intelligence expansion and the ramp-up timing of the power generation capacity is sharpening up as the major hyperscalers are already experiencing power undersupply. The inconsistency is more than clear, and the government will now require data center operators to pay for their electricity needs. This could strengthen the investment commitments and collaborations between technology and utility players, boosting the development of the national power grid with accompanying generation capacity. Hence, I would like to reaffirm my bullish stance on the VPU ETF, as the favorable power demand profile could strengthen the sector's earnings growth and dividend yield.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanguard Utilities ETF is established to provide an <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vpu#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">exposure</a> to the American utility sector, including stocks of companies engaged in the distribution of electricity, water, or gas, or that operate as independent power producers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund industry allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund industry allocation <span>(Vanguard)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s sector allocation didn’t change since my previous coverage, betting mainly on electric utilities (61.7% share) and multi-utilities (24.3% share).

On the one hand, the utility sector is benefiting from the rapid development of the AI infrastructure, which drives a significant increase in electricity demand. On the other hand, the main technology players are feeling the pressure from the AI frenzy, as investors are increasingly concerned over the unprecedented surge in AI CapEx and the potential returns on data center investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s becoming clear that the current power generation capacity is not keeping up with the AI infrastructure expansion. Meanwhile, the industry is going through favorable regulatory developments, where the newly negotiated rate protection <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556455-trump-orders-tech-giants-to-power-their-own-ai-data-centers-under-rate-protection-pledge\">pledge</a> would require major technology companies developing artificial intelligence data centers to cover their own electricity needs. As a result, this could significantly increase investments from tech giants into power generation sources.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) already <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-25/anthropic-adds-caveat-to-ai-safety-policy-in-race-against-rivals?srnd=phx-technology\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that it will pay for the costs of developing energy-related infrastructure required by its Stargate data centers by paying for additional infrastructure to support local energy grids or secure its own energy supply. At the same time, Amazon.com, Inc.

For reference, the largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/pjm-approves-118bn-transmission-expansion-plan-amid-data-center-boom/\" rel=\"nofollow\">approved</a> an $11.8 billion transmission expansion plan to keep up with surging data center connection requests across its footprint. This is especially relevant as the combined capital expenditures of the main hyperscalers are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873548-nvidia-doesnt-need-to-pay-for-its-chips-due-to-pricing-power\">expected</a> to top $650 billion in 2026, dedicated mainly to data center infrastructure. For comparison, the U.S. energy utilities are projected to invest $222 billion in 2026. This represents only a fraction of that going to the data centers, underlining the fact that there is substantial room for expansion in the utility companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, this represents a positive scenario for the utility sector, as the rising energy consumption for AI infrastructure stimulates capital investment expansion by the utility operators. The growth of investments could boost the utilities' rate base, which creates conditions for higher revenue requirements, earnings growth, and dividend distributions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the calculations of the VPU future upside potential, I will use the same weighted average target prices approach. According to the analyst estimates, VPU ETF has a 6.3% capital gain potential over the next 12-month horizon. Taking into account the forward DPS estimates, the total return of VPU ETF could be estimated at 9%, which makes me reaffirm my Buy recommendation on the fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation Model Based on Consensus Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"539\" height=\"725\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation Model Based on Consensus Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha; Author's Estimates)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking a closer look, we can notice that the largest part of the estimated upside potential should come from Vistra Energy, Constellation Energy, PG&amp;E Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCG\" title=\"PG&amp;E Corporation\">PCG</a>), Duke Energy, and NRG Energy, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NRG\" title=\"NRG Energy, Inc.\">NRG</a>). In particular, Vistra could benefit from its 2.6GW natural gas asset acquisition, the 20-year PPA at Comanche Peak NPP, and plans to develop two gas-fired units in West Texas. Constellation stands among the main beneficiaries of the data center electricity demand surge, since the company operates the largest fleet of nuclear power facilities with a total nameplate capacity of close to 28GW. PG&amp;E has a strong 5-year capital plan of $73 billion through 2030, which stipulates an average annual rate base growth of 9% and EPS growth of at least 9%. In addition, the California utility adds 2GW of projects in final engineering from last quarter, up to almost 3.6GW. Going forward, Duke Energy operates the second largest nuclear portfolio in the U.S. with 10GW in total capacity and has the largest fully regulated capital plan in the industry of $103 billion spanning over 5 years, which has the potential to drive up to a 7% long-term EPS growth rate. NRG Energy, in turn, targets a strong 14% annual growth in adjusted EPS and FCF through 2030, effectively doubling its generation capacity to 25GW following the closure of the LS Power transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the earnings estimates, the utility sector could register 8.4% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2026, compared to 2.7% blended growth so far in Q4. Moreover, the EPS growth is expected to accelerate during the year, which indicates strong dividend flow potential. In addition, the target interest rate is anticipated to drop by 50 bps over the next 12-month horizon. This could alleviate the industry’s debt burden, strengthen earnings, and make the utilities dividend profile more appealing compared to the 10-year government bond yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, I will reaffirm my bullish call on the VPU ETF, which has the potential for up to a 10% return over the next one-year period. I believe that the utility sector is one of the most prominent investment opportunities in 2026, powered by solid fundamentals behind energy demand growth from AI infrastructure and favorable regulatory support.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Natural disasters remain a critical risk factor for utility sector infrastructure. For instance, Edison International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EIX\" title=\"Edison International\">EIX</a>) shares fell sharply in the beginning of last year amid massive wildfires in California, with ongoing investigations into whether faulty equipment at the company was involved in the fires. Meanwhile, with capital expenditures rising, the role of government regulation is increasing, as the ability to pass on additional costs to consumers depends on the regulator's position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rapid development of AI infrastructure is the main driving factor for the growth in the utility sector. The existing gap between data center electricity needs, which are growing exponentially, and the current capacity of the U.S. power grid is forcing utility operators to accelerate capital projects. An increased rate base strengthens utilities’ financial performance, which positively impacts earnings and dividend yield, increasing the investment attractiveness of the industry. Against this backdrop, I believe that VPU ETF is a reasonable investment with the potential to deliver up to a 10% return over a 1-year horizon.</p>",

Given the company's healthy balance sheet and low non-accruals with healthy internal risk ratings, the core debate here is not whether OBDC can survive or not, but rather why the market is penalizing it to such a great degree. Yes, a dividend cut is likely, as we will discuss in this article, especially given that the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting rates this year and spreads stay quite tight in the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the market has overreacted, and while I would not pay a one-times or greater NAV ratio on OBDC shares given the hefty fees that management charges and the headwinds that the industry faces, I think that the current discount to NAV looks far too wide, and therefore rate it a strong buy today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inside the Portfolio: Senior Secured Strength and Diversification</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important aspects of the <span class=\"highlighted_text\">OBDC <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829842-12-percent-yielding-strong-buys-golub-capital-bdc-edges-out-blue-owl-capital\">thesis</a></span> is the state of its investment portfolio, as there have been a lot of fears raised in the media recently about the state of private credit, with UBS (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBS\" title=\"UBS Group AG\">UBS</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556438-ubs-hikes-worst-case-private-credit-default-view-to-15-on-ai-fears\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556438-ubs-hikes-worst-case-private-credit-default-view-to-15-on-ai-fears\" target=\"_blank\">forecasting up to 15% default rates</a> in the near future. The market seems to be pricing this into OBDC right now, given its over 20% discount to NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the fundamentals are actually quite strong, with the company having a 79% senior secured portfolio, with 73.1% of its debt invested in first-lien loans. Additionally, the portfolio is very well diversified with 234 companies across 30 industries, with its top 10 positions representing just 23% of its portfolio on a fair value basis.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"933\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"392\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also has significant joint venture and specialty finance investments that amount to about 12% of the portfolio, which are less exposed to falling base rates and have generated higher returns on equity over time, with over 14% ROEs based on management's commentary on the latest earnings call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking a deeper look at the health of the portfolio, they have strong headline numbers with only 1.1% non-accruals at fair value and 2.3% at cost, which are competitive with many other BDCs out there. There's certainly been no indication of distress. Additionally, their internal risk ratings are pretty healthy, with 90.7% of the portfolio falling into an internal risk rating of 1 or 2 and only 1.4% of the portfolio falling at the riskiest level of either 4 or 5, which importantly is unchanged quarter over quarter and shows that they are unlikely to see a significant spike in non-accruals in the near term and are also at low risk of significant long-term capital losses based on the current state of their portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buybacks, Balance Sheet Strength, and a BAA2 Upgrade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also has been buying back stock pretty aggressively recently, with $148 million worth of shares repurchased in Q4 alone, which delivered $0.05 per share in NAV accretion. For an externally managed BDC, that is a pretty noteworthy buyback and is being done at a discount that is creating significant value for shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, the company's balance sheet remains in solid shape with a 1.19 times debt-to-equity ratio, which is below their upper target limit of 1.25 times, and with $4.2 billion in total liquidity, as well as a weighted average debt maturity of 4.3 years. Moreover, Moody's just upgraded the company in January to Baa2, giving it one of the strongest credit ratings in the BDC space. That is an additional vote of confidence in the quality of OBDC's balance sheet and investment portfolio. The company's debt maturities are also well laddered, with maturities staggered nicely over the next several years and the vast majority of their debt not coming due until 2029 or later.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721333116328309.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" width=\"331\" height=\"455\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"331\" data-height=\"455\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721333116328309.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721333116328309.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Cut Ahead?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving forward, we expect the company to face near-term net interest income headwinds from additional Federal Reserve rate cuts, continued loan repayments that they have to reinvest into new loans that are at less positive spreads, and them having to refinance some debt this year that has matured at interest rates that are materially lower than what they'll be able to refinance them at in the current market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, they can also repurchase shares, which should be accretive to both NAV and adjusted net investment income, and they're taking additional steps to try to reduce financing costs while also investing in specialty finance and joint venture opportunities that are less rate sensitive and have been generating very strong returns on equity. OBDC is also generating solid net investment income yields, with its most recent quarter posting an adjusted NII of $0.36 per share, which amounts to a 12.4% annualized adjusted NII yield on the current cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, however, we expect the dividend to be cut this year due to the fact that the base dividend already exceeds the company's adjusted NII ($0.37 vs. $0.36), and that gap should only widen moving forward due to the aforementioned factors. That being said, it will probably only have to be cut by 10% to 20%, which, given the current yield, means that the dividend yield on current cost should remain above 10% this year. If the company decides to make a deeper cut to its base dividend than that, it will likely pay out substantial supplemental distributions, which would still bring the effective yield on cost to above 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, if the company continues to lean into debt buybacks or share repurchases, that should help prop up NAV per share, especially if their underwriting performance remains solid. Management gave every indication that they plan to continue buying back stock as they expanded their authorization to $300 million. As management stated on the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872219-blue-owl-capital-corporation-obdc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872219-blue-owl-capital-corporation-obdc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a>, they're,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>going to actively look at comparing buying stock versus deploying capital into the market. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, insider buying has been quite strong in recent months, which indicates management's conviction in the portfolio area.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OBDC Insider Purchases\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OBDC Insider Purchases <span>(Insider Cow)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Investors Cannot Ignore</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, OBDC does have risks to keep in mind. Not only could a dividend cut potentially reduce sentiment on the stock (though this has been happening across the BDC space, and it has not impacted shares much at all recently due to the floating rate nature of their underlying holdings, which I recently detailed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867850-why-bdc-dividend-cuts-arent-the-red-flag-investors-think\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867850-why-bdc-dividend-cuts-arent-the-red-flag-investors-think\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), there is also a risk of credit deterioration. Therefore, if internal risk ratings of 3 to 5, and especially 4 to 5, begin to spike, that could be a sign that the company's health is deteriorating markedly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, OBDC does have exposure to software, with it making up 11.1% of its portfolio. Therefore, if software truly gets disrupted by AI, that could also weaken the company's underwriting portfolio. That said, OBDC takes precautions with its software lending and has an excellent track record in the sector, so I'm not too concerned about that. It is worth noting that management emphasized on the earnings call that the loan-to-value ratios on their software loans are in the 30%, which adds an additional margin of safety to that section of OBDC's portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why the Market May Be Getting OBDC Completely Wrong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe that OBDC is likely headed for a dividend cut, but investors are still going to likely enjoy a double-digit yield on current cost while being able to buy shares at a huge discount to net asset value despite the company selling a substantial portion of its underlying loans in line with the marks that they received from the third-party valuation agency and also engaging in fairly substantial buybacks. It also trades at a much bigger discount than its historical average has been, and just last July it traded roughly in line with its NAV, despite its underlying fundamentals today being nearly identical to where they were then.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2940\" data-height=\"1960\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"tikr.com\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>tikr.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I think OBDC warrants a strong buy rating right now, especially given that it trades at a huge discount to sector peers like Ares Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>), which has a similarly positioned portfolio and is putting up similar strong overall numbers, as I recently detailed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871971-the-hidden-math-behind-ares-capital-beating-oaktree-specialty-lending\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871971-the-hidden-math-behind-ares-capital-beating-oaktree-specialty-lending\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it is not one of my very favorite BDCs at the moment, it is on my watch list for potential inclusion in my 7% to 8% yielding <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/47771937-samuel-smith/6260780-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/47771937-samuel-smith/6260780-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\" target=\"_blank\">total return outperforming</a> and below-market beta portfolio at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\" target=\"_blank\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",
