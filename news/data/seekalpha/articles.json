(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a></span>). In the article, I rated the stock as a “Hold” but in my conclusion, I was rather cautious<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and leaned more towards a bearish point of view:</span></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>It is very difficult to answer the question if Broadcom is fairly valued right now and if the stock is a buying opportunity. Considering the high risk of a recession and the high probability of semiconductor sales (including AI sales) declining combined with Broadcom still trading for high valuation multiples, I would be very cautious. Broadcom is certainly not a “Buy” in my opinion and a “Hold” at best. But I still see rather high downside risk right now and would not be surprised if the stock is cut in half again.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at the stock performance since then, the stock was not cut in half, but almost doubled. While the S&amp;P 500 increased 25% in value (which is already a great performance), Broadcom increased 92% in value and was the<a href=\"https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;f=idx_sp500&amp;o=-perf26w\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> 8th best performing stock</a> in the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the impressive performance, I will argue once again that Broadcom is a „Hold“ at best. Aside from the revenue concentration and only a few companies being responsible for a huge part of revenue (which might not necessarily be a problem), it is especially the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry making me cautious. Additionally, we should not ignore the risk of AI being a bubble right now and companies suddenly reducing investments in AI-infrastructure. When combining these risks with the high valuation multiples Broadcom is trading for right now, my assessment of Broadcom is rather bearish right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s start by looking at the last quarterly results and Broadcom reported great results once again and<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4492480-broadcom-non-gaap-eps-of-1_69-beats-by-0_03-revenue-of-15_95b-beats-by-130m\"> beat on revenue as well as earnings per share.</a>. And not only did Broadcom beat expectations, but net revenue also increased from $13,072 million in Q3/24 to $15,952 million in Q3/25 – resulting in 22.0% year-over-year top line growth. While revenue already grew at a high pace, operating income increased 55.4% year-over-year from $3,788 million in the same quarter last year to $5,887 million in this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1568\" data-height=\"1444\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom is reporting third quarter results for fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"589\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom 10-Q (Q3/25)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And finally, the company switched from a diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the same quarter last year to a diluted net income per share of $0.85 in this quarter. And non-GAAP earnings per share increased from $1.24 in Q3/24 to $1.69 in Q3/25 – resulting in 36.3% year-over-year growth. Free cash flow increased 46.6% year-over-year from $4,791 million in Q3/24 to $7,024 million in Q3/25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 1: Cyclical Business</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first risk, we should not ignore is that Broadcom is a rather cyclical business. Right now, we see high growth rates for semiconductors, but we should not make the mistake to assume these growth rates are lasting forever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at quarterly revenue growth rates for Broadcom in the last almost 20 years we see huge fluctuations between extremely high growth rates and extremely low growth rates. Hence, we should not make the mistake to extrapolate current growth rates into the future and assume 20%, 30% or 40% growth for revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we see a similar picture for return on invested capital. On average, return on invested capital was 12.63% in the last 10 years but we see huge fluctuations between a negative return of 7% in 2016 and 31% in 2018. In the last two years, return on invested capital also fluctuated heavily – in 2023 it was 24%, in 2024 it was 8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will come back to growth assumptions for Broadcom in the years to come. At this point, our statement of Broadcom (and the semiconductor industry) being cyclical is enough and we should not make the mistake to suddenly assume high and highly consistent growth rates now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 2: Revenue Concentration</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its last Annual Report, Broadcom stated once again that a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of the company’s net revenue. In fiscal 2024, management is estimating that aggregate sales to the top five end customers (through all different channels) account for 40% of total revenue (after accounting for 35% of sales in 2023). Management is also estimating that a significant customer concentration in the years to come will remain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Broadcom is not disclosing which five customers are accounting for such a huge portion of revenue, it is mostly considered to be Apple Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Alphabet Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and one large distributor, which is selling a huge amount of products from Broadcom. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In case of B2B businesses, a concentration on only a few customers is not unusual. However, the risk remains that a single customer can lead to a steep revenue decline and therefore has a huge impact on the overall performance of the business. Being responsible for a huge part of overall revenue is also leading to pricing power for these customers and as Broadcom investors, we don’t want a customer to have pricing power over Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, Broadcom added another major customer to its list as the company and OpenAI signed a contract.<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> In a press release</a>, OpenAI states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>OpenAI and Broadcom today announced a collaboration for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators. OpenAI will design the accelerators and systems, which will be developed and deployed in partnership with Broadcom. (…) OpenAI and Broadcom have long-standing agreements on the co-development and supply of the AI accelerators. The two companies have signed a term sheet to deploy racks incorporating the AI accelerators and Broadcom networking solutions.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And although it is not clear whether Broadcom will actually generate $10 billion in sales from this deal (it seems likely that $10 billion is the project value and not the revenue Broadcom will generate), we are talking about 17% of Broadcom’s annual revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, it is a multi-year deal for Broadcom and therefore might add maybe $2 billion in annual revenue. I don’t want to downplay this deal as it is a huge win for Broadcom, but company needs to grow at a high pace in order to be fairly valued and this deal alone might add about 3% annual growth for the next few years, which is just a fraction of the necessary growth rate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 3: High Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third and biggest risks that remains is the high valuation multiples Broadcom is trading for. And since my last article, the valuation multiples got even higher. Right now, Broadcom is trading for 86.4 times earnings, and this is clearly above the long-term average of 47.06. Additionally, the stock is now trading for a P/FCF ratio of 65.6, which is clearly above the long-term average of 22.99 and much higher than in my last article in April 2025 (P/FCF ratio was 35.5 back then).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead of just looking at simple valuation multiples, we will calculate an intrinsic value for the stock by using a discount cash flow calculation once again. As always, let’s calculate with a 10% discount rate and the last reported number of diluted shares outstanding (4,860 million). As basis for our calculation, we use the free cash flow of the last four quarters ($24,930 million) and in order to be fairly valued, Broadcom must grow 20% annually for the next ten years followed by a 6% growth rate till perpetuity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are already high growth rates and only a few companies are able to achieve such high growth rates over long timeframes. However, we could also make the argument that using a discount rate of 10% might not be enough in case of Broadcom. When calculating a WACC by using the last reported numbers for debt, equity, cost of debt and tax rate and using the 10-year treasury yield as risk free rate and adding a 6% market risk premium, we get a number close to 18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fairly valued in this scenario, Broadcom has to grow 44% annually for the next ten years followed by 6% growth till perpetuity. While I would see an annual growth of 44% for ten years in a row being out of reach, we should also not forget that this calculation is implying an 18% annual return for investors over the long run (which would be great and a number only a handful of investors are able to constantly achieve).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Growth Estimates</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s stick with our first calculation and ask whether a growth rate of 20% annually is realistic for Broadcom. Now we can come back to OpenAI’s $10 billion project. Even with that amount spent in only 12 months, it would not be enough to lead to 20% growth. I don’t claim that 20% annual growth is impossible for Broadcom and in the last ten years, the company grew its earnings per share with a CAGR of 28.66%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management is also optimistic in its short-term guidance and for the upcoming quarter. During the last earnings call CFO Kirsten Spears made the following statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $17.4 billion, up 24% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $10.7 billion, up 30% year-on-year. Within this, we expect Q4 AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion, up 66% year-on-year.

However, this is probably still resulting in about 20% growth for the bottom line. Broadcom does not really offer a mid-or-long-term guidance (at least no specific figures), but analysts are offering growth expectations for the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1388\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom: Consensus EPS Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Broadcom: Consensus EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/earnings/estimates\">Analysts are quite optimistic</a> for the next few years and between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2029, earnings per share are expected to grow with a CAGR of 34.6% and therefore more than enough to justify the growth rates in the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When talking about high, double-digit growth rates, the biggest part of growth usually must come from top line growth as in most cases neither share buybacks nor margin improvement can contribute with such a high pace. For share buybacks to lead to more than 10% annual growth (assuming a company does not take on additional debt for share buybacks) a stock must always at a single digit price-free-cash flow ratio. And margin improvement contributing at least 10% annually to growth will lead quickly to margins close to 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, we should not ignore that improving margins are also contributing to bottom line growth. And over the last 20 years, Broadcom is reporting constantly improving margins. Although we see fluctuations (especially for the operating margin, the gross margin is more stable), margins are moving higher over the long run, which is a good sign for the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we should also look at the number of diluted shares outstanding.

From a German point of view, energy prices are still extremely low in the United States, but people might get more and more annoyed about rising energy prices, which could lead to a discussion whether AI companies must pay for these costs somehow and this might have an impact on future investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I see it as a possibility that Broadcom will grow with a pace of 20% or more in the next ten years, I am rather on the side of caution and would not bet on these growth rates to keep up for such a long timeframe. After all, Broadcom is a cyclical business (see section above).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Broadcom is too expensive to be a good investment. Of course, I must admit that the stock was a great investment in the last five years, and I was clearly too pessimistic. Nevertheless, I don’t know whether Broadcom is a good long-term investment at this point or whether the company must grow into the stock’s extremely high valuation in the next few years leading to either a stagnating stock price over a few years or a steeper decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_493f684a8a0e5466a0b463c65f3e8a1b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don’t want to short Broadcom at this point as valuation multiples don’t seem so discounted from reality that a “Sell” rating is justified, but at this point the stock is a “Hold” at best.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) called “The Next To Join The $3 Trillion Club.” The rationale was, and remains, quite simple. Amazon is one of the best-positioned companies in trends such as cloud, AI, and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> e-commerce, among several other segments that have secular growth. All this comes with a valuation below its average, which allows us to say that its margin of safety is one of the best among the magnificent seven today.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But obviously, there are some reasons why the company is trading below its historical average, such as greater maturity of its margin (but in my view, it still has a lot of room to expand), but mainly factors such as Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") growing less than its peers, in addition to issues such as tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q2, my post-release <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807151-amazon-q2-almost-flawless-performance-misunderstood-by-the-market\">article</a>, I argued that the market had misunderstood the quarter, as the stock was falling about 4% in after-hours trading, with the market concerned about guidance and AWS growing “only” 17.5% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">Q3 came</a> to change that perception. It was a very positive quarter, where the company showed that AWS is not lagging behind and that the other segments also continue to have strong momentum. And this time, the market recognized this in a very significant way, with AMZN shares already reaching almost 10% gains in after-hours trading. But while I recognize that this quarter was positive, I don't consider it any more bullish than <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4475905-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_68-beats-by-0_35-revenue-of-167_7b-beats-by-5_59b\">Q2</a> was, and that's why the title of this analysis is that the market is not that right about this quarter, and may be overreacting again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon Q3: A Trick But Solid Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I liked the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287289-amazon-com-announces-third-quarter-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 earnings</a>, but before breaking it down, it's worth commenting on market perception. In Q2, sales growth was 13% YoY, exactly the same growth as in Q3. The difference in top line is that in the last quarter, international contributed more to this growth, and in this quarter, AWS resumed its growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand that the narrative of Cloud and AI ends up being more important pillars than just international growth, even because of their representation in operating income, but this is enough to show how often the market is focusing on very short-term triggers, and it is enough to either punish the stock heavily or cause it to trade 10% higher after just one quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511697-amazon-surges-after-q3-beat-driven-by-aws-ad-growth-offsetting-margin-pressures\">10% gains</a> in after-hours trading are an overreaction; the company deserves this recognition, but note that just by slightly improving the clarity of the prospects, which, let's face it, weren't that bad in the last quarter, Mr. Market added $200 billion in market cap to Amazon. What I mean is that even though the prospects have improved, and the third quarter results are good, Amazon is essentially the same company it was three months ago, meaning that Amazon shareholders who are focused on the long term had an opportunity to increase their exposure to an excellent company due to an “overreaction” by the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Returning to the results, Amazon achieved $180.2 billion in sales this quarter, which is a 13.4% YoY growth, exceeding market estimates by about $2.44 billion, but that means a small beat of about 1.5%. Where the company really surprised was in EPS, which exceeded estimates by $0.39, or a beat of more than 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as we saw in yesterday's analysis of Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (you can check it <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834994-alphabet-q3-ive-never-been-more-bullish-on-google-rating-upgrade\">here</a>), this beat should be analyzed in a little more depth. Note in the <a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">income statement</a> below that Q3 2025 operating income was virtually unchanged from Q3 2024. What really changed was other income, which was inflated by gains from investments in Anthropic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"869\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Income Statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"550\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482915976_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon 10-Q</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think this makes it a bad quarter, much less a cause for concern for long-term shareholders, as it also shows how Amazon had the strategic vision to invest in a company that is already perceived to have improved potential. What should be clear is that the jump in EPS was not that high this quarter when compared YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for this is that the operating margin decreased in all segments compared to Q3 2024. North America went from 5.9% to 4.5%, and International went from 3.6% to 2.9%, while AWS went from 38.1% to 34.6%. This would be an extremely bearish point if it were basically such a significant increase in the cost and expense structure to sustain top-line growth that was not that high, but in fact, much of this was more cyclical than structural.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North America, for example, would have had an operating income of $7.3 billion, had it not been for the $2.5 billion charge from a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. In other words, without this impact, the operating margin would have gone from 5.9% to 6.9%. In the other segments, all were impacted by “costs related to planned role eliminations,” according to the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also worth mentioning that the guidance for Q4 is in the range of $206 to $213 billion, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511758-earnings-snapshot-amazon-tops-expectations-as-aws-sales-rise-20\">$1.37 billion</a> above the estimates midpoint, which also alleviates some concerns about a slowdown at this time of year and competition with players such as the intense dispute that is taking place in Brazil with MercadoLibre (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MELI\" title=\"MercadoLibre, Inc.\">MELI</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"662\" data-height=\"345\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Q3 results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576482155645_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding AWS, the release mentioned that the Cloud business is accelerating due to strong demand for AI and core infrastructure. This is very bullish and one of the things that the market is weighing, in my view, but I also liked another comment even more:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is just another endorsement that it is possible to be bullish on Amazon's bottom line in the long term, with more and more AI and robotics improving the company's efficiency and consequently improving the shareholder value that can be generated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the margin was not that bearish for Amazon's case, so together with the improvement in top-line growth, it is still possible to say that it was a very solid quarter. This corroborates the perception that Amazon is very well-positioned.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon: 17% Gains For 2026? Sign Me In</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a value investor, and someone who was already bullish on Amazon before this quarter, even though the quarter showed that the next few quarters are a little clearer in terms of AWS growth and margin improvement, the 10% after-hours gains slightly worsen the margin of safety and my appetite for increasing my position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But remembering my last analysis, in which I argue that the company could reach around $3 trillion in market cap in 2026, these 10% gains still do not remove all the asymmetry from the case, since we are still talking about a market cap of ~$2.55 trillion after this correction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My latest projections, based on very reasonable assumptions, already show operating income of $97 billion for 2026, without the company having to maintain growth above 10% for North America and international markets, nor maintain such a high margin for the segments. In other words, if the momentum we saw in Q3 continues, it is possible that this number will be exceeded without much difficulty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1432\" data-height=\"573\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57960026-17618576486763065_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author (Kenio Fontes)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if we are talking about $100 billion in operating income and a multiple of 30x, again, we are already talking about a $3 trillion market cap for 2026. If the market already assigns this multiple in December next year, we are talking about a 17% upside for the next ~14 months, which is very attractive for a company of this quality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though I believe that the market has been overreacting to earnings lately and is increasingly less focused on the long term, I believe that Amazon's third quarter was positive. In addition, the 10% gains do not remove all the margin of safety from the position, and we can still easily envision more double-digit returns next year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I still see Amazon stock as a solid Buy.</p>",

We do this by selling call options, where the managers decide on the strike or the price that the stock has to hit before it is called away, or the seller is forced to sell, And the length of time until the expiration of the contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">YieldMax does all of this for you, and the NVDY value proposition is essentially that the active management of day-to-day options trading is taken care of for 1.27% per year. This is a fee that is likely worth paying if you are interested in this strategy and are unwilling to execute it on your own or unable to due to time constraints, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I outlined the specifics of their strategy in an article in January. As far as I know, there hasn't been much change to the way that they target strikes, so reviewing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4750202-nvdy-risks-remain-too-high-despite-its-excellent-performance\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4750202-nvdy-risks-remain-too-high-despite-its-excellent-performance\" target=\"_blank\">that section on strategy construction</a> is still relevant today. There, you can see my modeling of the options positions in more granular details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long and short is that the fund is 100% short-term Treasuries, which are used to secure options against Nvidia. They use these options to create synthetic exposure to long stock, mirroring the profit and loss of holding shares outright. They then sell dynamically against this position, attempting to generate at least 80% of the stock's upside, by moving into and out of options positions every day. You can find the intraday trading logs on <a href=\"https://yieldmaxetfs.com/our-etfs/nvdy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://yieldmaxetfs.com/our-etfs/nvdy/\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top holdings look like this, but note that they change every day:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"829\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDY holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"436\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-17618502687410977_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YieldMax ETFs</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What it boils down to is that it's nearly impossible for investors to track and calculate every move that NVDY makes. But I don't think that's the point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want that level of granular detail, which I used to provide these analyses, I think you're likely better off running your own options strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those invested in this fund are likely interested in offloading the options management. And while they're likely interested in how that management works, I think the bigger worry is how well this fund will work when NVDA is not on a bull run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Will it still produce enough income for them? What about their principle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the kinds of questions I think are more important than \"how out of the money are their strikes?\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fighting Gravity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I worry quite a bit about capital destruction, which is present in many covered call funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way it works with these funds is like this:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The fund sells a call.</li> <li>The fund's underlying asset breaches the strike of that call.</li> <li>The fund must realize a loss in order to roll the call.</li> <li>This results in capital loss for investors.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the strike of the call is not breached, and in those cases, the covered call investment wins. This is easier to do as a manager when you are working with an index, which tends to move more slowly and in response to macro events. This is much harder to do as a manager with a single stock that responds idiosyncratically, due to earnings results and things said by management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps too cynically, I see that these kinds of idiosyncratic issues of being at the whims of one stock are increasingly a problem of the indexes, where the Nasdaq is now nearly 10% NVDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is this destruction in action. Remember that earlier I was just showing total return, which includes all dividends reinvested. The difference between the total return and the price return is staggering.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fd0660608fa832cc58c14c1adfc6e6c6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's look at this same chart in dollar amounts, just to make sure we're all on the same page here, with what this actually looked like in a real-world investment situation.

I feel the same way about almost all single stock covered call ETFs, and I think that many investors are suckered in by the promise of ultra-high income figures. But protecting one's principle is incredibly important. Protecting principle affects your ability to cash flow in the future; We must remember that those needing income don't just need it today, tomorrow, next month, or next year, but potentially for 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you erode your capital too fast, and in two years, -15% to me is too fast, then you will have little left at that 10-15-20 year mark. Of course, you could solve this by reinvesting part of the distributions and trimming down any distribution above some necessary limit, likely dependent on your personal income needs, could work to solve this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't like recommending DRIP, even partial DRIP, because it is so idiosyncratic to your income needs, and also because I feel like it covers for the fund's greatest weakness, which is that it has historically over-distributed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While that trend hasn't been present since May, it should be noted that since May, NVIDIA has been back on its near-vertical trajectory, and so it's tough to objectively evaluate good performance in a bull run.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">RoC &amp; Taxes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I hinted at the Return of Capital (\"RoC\") component a bit earlier, but I think it deserves its own section. I feel less and less of a need to cover this because it is becoming much more widely known among the income investing community, but it still bears mentioning that part of the returns of NVDY are RoC, which have special tax rules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's what you need to know:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>RoC is not considered taxable income in the year that you earned it.</li> <li>Instead, RoC is counted against your cost basis.</li> <li>Taxes are realized when you sell the shares, allowing for deferred taxes on gains made from NVDY, despite receiving the income every week.</li> <li>If your cost basis hits zero, then all future ROC distributions are taxed in the year that you receive them, but they are all taxed at your long-term capital gains tax rate.</li> <li>Because capital gains tax rates are traditionally and typically lower than income tax rates, this makes the distributions from NVDY more attractive to income investors investing outside tax-advantaged accounts.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is the schedule of all the distributions since April and the amount of ROC that they were. It ranges anywhere from 95-97% to 0%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1207\" data-height=\"438\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDY distribution schedule.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59331233-1761852028458489_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YieldMax ETFs</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVIDIA had a very good earnings call in Q2, and they've announced more partnerships since then, and their business is growing. Meanwhile, NVDY promises income in exchange for giving up some of the upside on the world's most valuable company. I find that proposition tough to swallow, especially because of NVIDIA's trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I always recommend more diversified exposure within covered call funds because being beholden to the idiosyncratic risks, like losing out on upside that results from earnings updates which often happen suddenly and without warning, can lead to long-term capital erosion. This is true of almost all single-stock ETFs. In that, I feel investors are better served with other funds. That being said, some are and have been rewarded tremendously by this, though they often lag the underlying asset. In this way, it feels like only a partial win where you were right on the bet and suffered through all the volatility like in April but were only given a partial reward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I'm going to suffer all the downside, I want all the upside. I don't feel this way about indexes, of which I have, and which I need less conviction to invest large amounts of money into. That is not true for individual stocks. Having the conviction necessary to hold on during drawdowns is very difficult, especially if you are not being rewarded through all the upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider that, as well as your timeline and your ability to withstand capital erosion and long-term drawdowns of your principal, before investing in NVDY.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",

Given that I've <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815193-novo-nordisk-cleared-for-climb\">previously conducted a more detailed</a>, and I think it's fair to say, very<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> positive analysis, and currently rate Novo as a Buy, I thought it’s the perfect time to unpack and reassess the risks involved, and take a fresh look at them ahead of earnings.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve admitted to myself—and I believe I’m not the only one—that we tend to fall in love with our own decisions, and that can often turn out to be a costly mistake. Psychologically, when someone strongly believes in a particular investment, they often look for information that confirms the validity and strength of the thought process they had when making the decision to buy that position. Sometimes the belief can become so strong that acknowledging risks—even when they’re flashing right in front of you—becomes incredibly difficult.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My current thinking has been that Novo—while I do acknowledge there are some risks out there—remains undervalued. That’s why I’ve been fairly comfortable letting NVO hover in the $50–55 range, without paying too much attention, and waiting for it to find a stronger footing. Given the relatively non-emotional mindset considering Novo I’m in right now, I think it’s the perfect time to actively search for and lay out all the risks, and to look them straight in the eye for what they are to preempt any surprises before earnings kick in next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said—and since I’ve already done a more detailed analysis earlier—let's jump straight into the potential sources of headwinds and examine them through the lens of what may have shifted since my last review back in August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Just as I was finishing this analysis, news broke that Novo has made a bid to outplay Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) with a new offer for Metsera (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTSR\" title=\"Metsera, Inc.\">MTSR</a>). Having done a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828589-pfizer-mastering-the-art-of-the-deal-with-metsera-upgraded-to-buy\">couple of analyses</a> on this topic—including one focused on Metsera before Pfizer’s deal was announced—I'll briefly share a few thoughts here.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Novo-Metsera</strong></em></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it wasn’t solely my original thought—a few analysts also wrote on the same topic—I highlighted it in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828589-pfizer-mastering-the-art-of-the-deal-with-metsera-upgraded-to-buy\">my analysis</a> of the Pfizer-Metsera deal:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><em>At least one of the current leaders in the obesity sector likely fought with Pfizer until the very final stages and also presented a higher bid. However, the ultimate consideration by Metseras’ board reportedly centered on potential regulatory headwinds. Common sense suggests that the only bidders who would face such intense regulatory scrutiny are the current obesity sector duopoly members—their involvement would have certainly drawn that kind of attention.</em></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it’s worth acknowledging that the original thinking held water—the higher bidder did turn out to be Novo. Second, it’s hard to view the deal as immediately positive for Novo. It could reflect a cautious outlook on their own pipeline, suggesting they may lack full confidence in their current developments. From a longer-term perspective, however, the science behind Metsera appears very strong, as I concluded in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821206-metsera-an-emerging-contender-in-the-glp1-arena\">my earlier analysis</a>. Metsera offers more than just a few promising drugs in development; it represents a substantial IP platform tied to the <a href=\"https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.bloom\" rel=\"nofollow\">very foundations of GLP-1</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The presentation slide from my previous work about the roots of Metsera:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"903\" data-height=\"429\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-17618226824030554_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Metsera Origin Story <span>(Metsera Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third thought is that we may not be done here yet. Metsera <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4499983-metsera-ultra-long-acting-glp-1-met-097i-excels-mid-stage-trial\">had a successful readout shortly after</a> the Pfizer deal was announced, so there could be some interesting dynamics still to unfold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The analysis continues as originally planned from here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks Update from My Previous Analysis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll go through these one by one, as they were originally laid out back in August.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the primary drivers behind the recent selloff is broad pessimism across the pharmaceutical sector</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering MFN (Most Favored Nation), the threat seems to have somewhat eased recently, thanks to Pfizer and the TrumpRx initiative. Big Pharma has started offering certain drugs directly to consumers, and this approach appears to satisfy the administration—at least for now. The discounts are substantial, reportedly in the 50–80% range, which makes sense, given the direct-to-consumer model that cuts out middlemen like PBMs and pharmacies—various pharma companies have indicated that intermediaries account for roughly 50% of the high list prices currently under debate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From what I’ve briefly checked, the drugs offered by that direct model may not be the top sellers, so by and large, this move provides meaningful relief for pharma companies at the moment. That said, “certainty” isn’t exactly the word of the day in this environment, so it’s important to stay alert on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, that’s not all when it comes to the leaders in the obesity sector, Novo and Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>), as of October 16, according to CNBC:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>During a Thursday press conference, Trump specifically mentioned Ozempic, referring to it as \"the fat loss drug\" when addressing questions about medication pricing. When asked if these drugs would cost $150 out of pocket, Trump stated, \"They’ll be much lower. They’ll be much lower.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s a lot of speculation about what he meant by that statement, and my take is that it could actually be a huge positive—if it turns out to be true.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831279-hims-and-hers-q3-could-provide-volatility-but-the-long-term-vision-remains-bright\">my analysis</a> of Hims &amp; Hers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIMS\" title=\"Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc.\">HIMS</a>):</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>A more plausible scenario than directly forcing manufacturers to sell at $150, which many understand, is that Trump could push to mandate broader coverage of weight-loss drugs within programs like Medicare or Medicaid and cap the patient co-pay at $150. This is certainly a more credible threat than simply forcing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to sell their drug at that low price point, which isn’t realistic in my view.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So makes a lot of sense to keep an eye on that topic in case analysts bring it up during the earnings call.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second major source of pressure is competitive</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here, I think it's appropriate to bring out what I wrote in the last analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic have slightly lower efficacy metrics compared to Eli Lilly and Company's (LLY) blockbusters Mounjaro and Zepbound, leading to some loss of market share. The company cut its guidance on July 29th, citing competitive headwinds, and the stock dropped nearly 22% that same day.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately — and Lilly has been vocal on their side—they're actually more than just slightly better when it comes to efficacy, as laid out by the \"SHAPE\" study, sponsored by Eli Lilly and published in May 2025 in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>A total of 751 participants underwent randomization. The least-squares mean percent change in weight at week 72 was −20.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], −21.4 to −19.1) with tirzepatide and −13.7% (95% CI, −14.9 to −12.6) with semaglutide (P&lt;0.001).</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Actually, a 6.5% difference in real-life efficacy is significant. While the research was commissioned and conducted by Lilly—and should be taken with at least some grain of salt—it still points to something that doesn’t exactly favor Novo. Of course, there are other factors to consider, like side effects and the fact that what works well for one individual might not be ideal for another. But we have to be honest: it does seem like Lilly has an edge here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other than that, Novo and Lilly continue to dominate the obesity market. While there are plenty of contenders, no new entrants are expected in 2026—and even 2027 looks highly unlikely. 2028, however, could be an interesting year, with new competitors potentially trying to enter the space and Novo and Lilly’s own next-generation drug innovations possibly gaining market access as well.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third factor, in my view, is technical</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my previous analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The stock peaked in June 2024, just below $150, and has since started to trend downward. In today's algorithm-driven trading environment, strong and clear trends often become self-reinforcing, driving prices lower regardless of underlying fundamentals.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Without making things too complex, it’s clear to anyone that nothing truly breakthrough-positive has happened technically. The attempt to gain strength above the $60 mark has failed, and we’re now back around the $50 level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1086\" data-height=\"587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/5914651-1761819708678936_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Novo Stock Price Chart <span>(FinViz)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the previous analysis Risks chapter, there was one more important point to bring out:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The most material near-term risk for Novo Nordisk is if oral Wegovy fails to secure FDA approval.

I don’t see any strong basis to anticipate a major miss or beat—results are likely to come in more or less in line. What matters more is their outlook, especially given the competitive dynamics: Lilly clearly has an edge and is gaining momentum, while compounders are legally required to interrupt their offerings; as I understand it, they haven’t fully done so yet.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it’s always great to take a step back and calmly consider the less favorable scenarios to avoid mistakes and negative surprises. In Novo’s case, the current price level looks quite compelling in my view—it's as if the market has already done the discounting work for us. Hopefully, we’ll see some positive news in the upcoming earnings release, and the market may begin to price Novo more favorably from here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This is a transformative deal, designed to gain more scale and boost margins<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> after both firms have seen very tough times recently.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal looks good on paper, but investors are not sold on the idea, potentially amidst added uncertainty at a tricky point in time, with both firms employing quite a bit of leverage in relation to minimal current earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, I see potential on paper, driven by ambitious synergy targets, yet a mixed track record of both firms makes me very cautious.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About Ryerson</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ryerson describes its business as a leading distributor and metal solutions' provider across North America. The company generates about $4.6 billion in annual revenues from such products and services, half of which tied to carbon, a quarter to stainless steel and the remainder of aluminum. The company offers some 75,000 products, supplied to about 40,000 customers, across a wide spectrum of industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These solutions are provided from no less than 110 operating locations, which employ some 4,300 workers. Despite a reasonable presence, the company is struggling with its margins, with EBITDA margins reported at just 2.5% of sales over the past year. It should be understood that both margins and sales were down substantially after a boom driven by an economic recovery and inflationary pressures in a post-pandemic era.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates in a highly fragmented market, which is dominated by Reliance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RS\" title=\"Reliance, Inc.\">RS</a>), which reports nearly $14 billion in annual sales. Ryerson claims to be the second player in this market, being much smaller, competing against the likes of Kloeckner, Worthington and also Olympic Steel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company has many plans to improve the business, Ryerson has seen some real struggles as a $3 billion business in 2015 saw sales peak at levels over $6 billion in 2022, with revenues now having fallen to $4.5 billion on a trailing basis. Historically, operating margins have come in anywhere between low single digit margins and high single digit margins, with the business recently even posting losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This painful reversal made that a peak price around $40 per share in 2023 has come down to the low-twenties here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Valuation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside the deal announcement of Olympic, Ryerson <a href=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> third quarter results. Year to date, revenues are down 3% and change to just below $3.5 billion, amidst flattish volumes and falling prices. The company actually managed to increase adjusted EBITDA in a minor way to $118 million, with net losses of $18 million working down to a loss of $0.58 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With 32 million shares trading at $23, a $736 million equity valuation excludes a substantial net debt load of $470 million, for a $1.2 billion pro forma enterprise valuation. This valued the business at just over 0.25 times sales and about 10 times EBITDA, these margins being minimal, and no earnings to show for.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About The Deal</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Facing tougher times, the company has <a href=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-and-Olympic-Steel-Announce-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-and-Olympic-Steel-Announce-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reached</a> an agreement to acquire Olympic Steel as the deal has been labeled as a merger. The transaction is structured as an all-stock-merger with 1.7105 shares of Ryerson offered for every share outstanding in Olympic Steel, with investors in Olympic on a combined basis owning 37% of the share base, suggesting a pro forma share count of 51 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With some 20 million shares issued to investors in Olympic, these were valued at $460 million at $23 per share. Including a $234 million net debt load, the business is valued close to $700 million, implying a valuation close to 0.35 times sales at close to $2.0 billion here. The company is posting adjusted EBITDA close to $70 million per annum, for margins close to 3.5%, minimally higher than the margins reported by Ryerson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pro forma EBITDA is seen around $190 million here, yet the combination operates with about $700 million in net debt, for elevated leverage ratios. The promise of the business is to deliver on $120 million in synergies, equal to 6% of the acquired sales. If this is realistic, EBITDA will increase to $300 million, for a leverage ratio in the low 2s, that is even at current depressed levels of industry profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real impact after taxes is a potential $2 per share accretion number on the bottom line. This however comes amidst tiny losses reported, with both firms posting EBITDA margins at just between 2.5-3.5% of sales here. A near 2% synergy target in relation to pro forma sales looks a bit ambitious, again equal to 6% of added sales.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors Are Not Buying It</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upon the deal announcement, shares have fallen from $23 and change to $21 and change, which makes that including the to be issued shares make for a $100 million decline in the pro forma market valuation here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might come amidst a relatively higher sales multiple offered and fears about dilution for investors in Ryerson. However, this excludes potential synergies, and even as I deem the number to be highly optimistic, even a partial realization of synergies could still make the deal interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In theory, all this should be highly appealing, so the set-up of lower expectations and potential for large synergies looks interesting. However, the reality is that, in my view, two average operators are combined, also considering potential disruption from such a merger. Furthermore, the performance trails that of the absolute market leader Reliance in a huge way.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, the potential of the deal to create value is compelling enough to keep a close eye on the development and achievements of the combined business going forward.</p>",

We also noted that Domino's<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Pizza (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DPZ\" title=\"Domino's Pizza, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">DPZ</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and Mastercard (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA\" title=\"Mastercard Incorporated\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">MA</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) were also looking like they were trading at some strong premium valuations. However, I dove into why I still felt that HD was worth holding for long-term dividend growth investors. Similarly, I would have made many of the same arguments for DPZ and MA at the time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, I believe that the overall equity markets are looking fairly stretched in terms of valuation. That doesn't mean that a pullback or bear market is inevitable, but one certainly wouldn't be too surprising. There simply needs to be a catalyst that could send the major indexes lower. In particular, the Magnificent 7 names that make up such a large portion of the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite these days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that said, I wanted to touch on some places where there still appears to be good value. That doesn't mean that these names won't decline in a market correction, but they could see a limited sell-off and could have further potential for upside going forward. As I'd view these as longer-term dividend growth holdings, I'm content being patient with these names—even if their share prices have appeared stubbornly low or even seen frustrating declines.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#1 American States Water Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWR\" title=\"American States Water Company\">AWR</a>) 2.72% Yield</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWR is a water utility company based in California, with its primary subsidiary of Golden State Water Company, delivering the largest slice of earnings.

The share price has been going mostly sideways since going back to around late 2019. This has created a situation where it has 'fallen' out of its fair value range based on the historical P/E levels, as the company continued to see earnings growth, but the share price was not compensated for this growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWR Fair Value Share Price Range\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AWR Fair Value Share Price Range <span>(Portfolio Insight)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At least some of the pressure here is due to the overall higher valuation multiple that was placed on water utilities during a zero-rate environment. As rates rose on the short and long ends, that can make an income-generating investment like AWR look generally less appealing. Therefore, seeing a lower share price would send the dividend yield higher. Even now, the dividend yield could be considered on the lower end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, as the rate environment shifts and the Fed has resumed with a rate cut and is projected to have further rate cuts, it could be time to start seeing companies like AWR start to rise. Morningstar's fair value estimate is based on an algorithm, and it puts it at $80.33. Wall Street Analysts, more broadly, have the company rated as a 'Hold', but with an average price target that is similarly higher, at $81.50.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWR Average Price Target\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AWR Average Price Target <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWR is also a dividend king, delivering <a href=\"https://americanstateswatercompany.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-states-water-company-announces-83-increase-quarterly-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">a raise earlier this year</a> on schedule for the 71st consecutive year.

Common Units\">EPD</a>) 7.05% Yield</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For those who want a higher yield and still see some respectable dividend growth, we have EPD. This is an MLP, so technically, they pay distributions due to the tax classification of the payout being characterized primarily as return of capital. There is also a K-1, for investors who are unfamiliar with EPD, though that is likely a relatively smaller portion of readers on this site—given that EPD is so popular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPD isn't as undervalued when compared to something like AWR above. Shares are off by 11.09% of their 52-week high, and YTD the units have declined by less than 2%. Most of the gains from this name are going to be derived from the higher distribution yield anyway, and a sideways price isn't all that uncommon for something that yields ~7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morningstar's analyst assigns a $33 unit price fair value estimate. Wall Street Analysts more broadly have it as a 'Buy' rating and an average price target of $35.72. Notably, that is estimating about 16% of upside from here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPD Average Price Target\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"202\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPD Average Price Target <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In looking at the forward EV/EBITDA, EPD trades at around 10x, which is below its decade average of 11.3x. That could indicate that investors are slightly undervaluing EPD units compared to where they had historically been.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of this could be due, again, to the higher rate environment, as EPD is considered an income-investment. Further, weakness in commodity prices has likely put a damper on investors' sentiment looking forward. While they have primarily fee-based contracts, they aren't completely immune to these prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On another valuation front, P/E is less reliable for MLPs in general. That said, EPD is a bit of an unusual exception because the business has interestingly delivered rather consistent EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPD EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPD EPS <span>(Portfolio Insight)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On that front, the fair value channel does have units currently slightly below the center of the fair value estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPD Unit Price Fair Valuation Range\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"262\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPD Unit Price Fair Valuation Range <span>(Portfolio Insight)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the higher yield of around 7%, it does sacrifice has seen a sacrifice in the level of distribution growth over the years.

Until the end of yesterday's trading session, the stock had barely moved<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> since, suggesting that the upside was sustained.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Come today, however, and the upside has now jumped to over 25%. Why? With its Q3 2025 results released, the company has raised earnings guidance. The development has gone down well with investors, with the stock up by more than 3% in today's session as I write. Here I discuss the latest quarterly numbers and guidance, but also point out risks to the outlook, which could impact the outlook negatively.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robust Q3 2025 results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's much to like about Eli Lilly's Q3 2025 results, starting with revenue growth. Among the first three quarters of 2025, the number saw its strongest increase in Q3 2025 of 54% YoY. As a result, the company's YTD revenue growth is now at 46% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's diabetes and weight loss treatments, Mounjaro and Zepbound respectively, expectedly led the revenue growth. While Mounjaro more than doubled, rising by 109% YoY, Zepbound rose by an even bigger 185% YoY in Q3 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the non-GAAP gross margin at 83.6%, was slightly lower than the 84.1% level seen year-to-date, there's still much to like about it. First, the gross profit grew by a strong 56% YoY. Also, it's an improvement over the 82.2% margin seen in Q3 2024. This year, the company has also started reporting a non-GAAP margin called the performance margin, which is similar to the operating margin. This number too, looks good, as it rose to 48.3% in Q3 2025 compared with 45.9% in Q2 2025.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"946\" data-height=\"472\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key financials, Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Eli Lilly</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increased guidance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's non-GAAP EPS increase was even bigger, by almost 6x YoY, resulting in a guidance upgrade. Starting with revenues, the company has raised guidance by 3.7% at the midpoint, and now expects the number to land in the range of USD 63-65 billion. The guidance range for the performance margin has also been increased, based on higher expectations from sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, the non-GAAP EPS to come in the range of USD 23-23.7 in 2025. After a disappointment in Q1 2025, when Eli Lilly actually lowered guidance, it has now seen two consecutive quarters of an improved outlook. At the midpoint of this range, the expected adjusted EPS has exceeded even the midpoint of the initial guidance range of USD 22.5-24. At USD 0.1, the increase in midpoint is less than 0.5% increase, but the upgrade definitely looks better compared to the prior guidance. It's up by 4.4% at the midpoint.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"992\" data-height=\"510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Eli Lilly</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market multiples look good</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the midpoint of the latest guidance range, LLY's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio comes to 34.84x. This is favorable compared to the stock's five-year average of 44.15x. As mentioned at the start, this indicates over 25% upside to the stock even now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that the guidance has been upgraded for two consecutive quarters, it's also instructive to consider how the stock looks if the EPS comes in at the top end of the guidance range. The picture doesn't change much, with the forward P/E now at 34.3x, with the Buy case sustaining for the short term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks to outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are also risks to the outlook. The first of them is a possible agreement with the US government, as peers like Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) and AstraZeneca (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>) have done recently. If it does come through, treatment prices are likely to be lower, which in turn can reduce margins. As I had pointed out in the previous article on Eli Lilly though, its margins have shown remarkable resilience in the past despite price reductions for Zepbound. But whether it happens again remains to be seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A more concrete, though minuscule, drag on earnings can be the company's <a href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-adverum-biotechnologies\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-adverum-biotechnologies\" target=\"_blank\">recent purchase</a> of the clinical stage company, Adverum Biotechnologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADVM\" title=\"Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.\">ADVM</a>), which is developing therapies for ocular diseases. Eli Lilly intends to make a cash payment of USD 3.56 per share for the acquisition, which comes to a total of USD 74.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This doesn't make a significant dent to the company's earnings, but it does shave off some USD 0.08 from the EPS. Assuming that the payout shows up in the non-GAAP figures, the reduction from the midpoint of the guidance range wouldn't merit a change in outlook. And considering the company's robust earnings performance YTD, chances are that it can still continue to report an EPS towards the top end of the guidance range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, on the achievement of milestones, the payout per share can rise to as much as USD 12.47, which, of course, can have a more significant impact on the EPS. But whether these targets, based on the treatment's approval and sales goals, are met will only be known only over the years. In other words, the expense won't impact a single year's earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, keeping these risks in mind, it's worth considering whether the stock's prospects change if the EPS comes in at the lower end of the guidance range. Turns out, LLY isn't particularly worse off. The forward P/E rises to just 35.37x, which is still significantly below the five-year average.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two weeks ago, there appeared to be a downside risk to Eli Lilly's earnings as an agreement with the US government was slated to be around the corner. Instead, it has delivered an earnings upgrade, backed by a robust performance in Q3 2025. The margins remain strong, and non-GAAP EPS growth has been exceptional.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No matter how the latest guidance is looked at, the stock continues to look attractive even in the short term. This is despite the company's recent purchase of Adverum Biotechnologies, which isn't expected to make any meaningful dent in earnings. But the risk of lowering prices, as its peers have recently done, still persists.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don't know what happens on that front next. Based on the information that is available, though, the prospects for Eli Lilly have only improved at the stock markets. For this reason, I'm retaining a Strong Buy on LLY.</p>",

ICVT has 364 holdings, a 30-day SEC yield of 1.09%, a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 1.77% and an expense ratio of 0.20%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As described in the prospectus by <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272819/ishares-convertible-bond-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\">iShares</a>, the underlying index exclusively includes <em>cash pay convertible bonds</em>, a class of convertible bonds with an option to convert into shares of the issuer’s common stock (conversion is not mandatory). Other categories of convertible bonds (zero coupon, preferred and mandatory convertible bonds) are not eligible. Additionally, eligible securities must be U.S. dollar-denominated, have at least 31 days until maturity and $250 million of outstanding face value. There is no requirement on credit rating. The index is weighted based on market capitalization and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The portfolio turnover rate was 25% in the most recent fiscal year and 22% in the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Convertible bonds are often used by growth-oriented companies, because optionality allows them to borrow money at a lower rate, and possibly avoid paying the principal, should the bond be converted. Optionality is also attractive for lenders willing to mix fixed income and speculation on share price. Convertible bonds are hybrid assets, so we can expect ICVT behavior to be between equity and fixed income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>P</strong><strong>ortfolio</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is mostly invested in securities issued by U.S. companies (about 85% of asset value). Non-rated securities represents 75% of assets, while 17% has an investment grade and 5% is below investment grade. The weighted-average yield to maturity is 1.94% and the weighted-average maturity is 3.36 years (85% of assets has a maturity below 5 years).

But after Q2, the stock slumped heavily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what has changed?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total (Sirius XM plus Pandora) revenues and adj. EBITDA were down slightly again, and so were subscriber numbers (both paying and trial subscribers). Self-pay subscribers were down even at Pandora. At the same time subscriber acquisition costs soared 19%. And despite the recent price increase ARPU was barely flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A glimpse of hope could be seen in the promotional trial funnel at Sirius XM, which increased a tiny bit during the quarter, although it remained down YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As usual, the company managed to compensate for the lower subscriber numbers and acquisition cost increases by cutting other expenses, so that overall margins were also just slightly down YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given continued cost discipline and the already announced lower capex levels, the company could slightly increase its guidance by $25m across the board for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>• Total revenue of approximately $8.525 billion,</p> <p>• Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.625 billion, and</p> <p>• Free cash flow of approximately $1.225 billion.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIRI/balance-sheet\">Net debt</a> was also reduced slightly during the quarter, and interest expenses are falling compared to recent times. All in all, the market probably sees the light at the end of the tunnel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given lower promotional activity related to Sirius XM's streaming service, further subscriber losses were expected. The market probably also feared increasing churn in the overall subscriber base, but churn was stable. Moreover, the minimal subscriber loss of just 40,000 confirmed the recent trend of improving subscriber losses. Given less promotion, a loss of just 40,000 subs could hint to the possibility that, with just the streaming issue further behind, Sirius XM could even be able to grow its subscriber base again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of it all, the market probably started to believe that Sirius XM will not only deliver $1.225B of FCF in 2025, but also the long-term guidance of $1.5B in 2027, given that capex is scheduled to decrease substantially from the currently high level:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1344\" data-height=\"752\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Declining capex schedule 2024-2028\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Sirius XM Q3/25 slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With $150m less satellite capex, another $50m reduction of non-satellite capex, and lower interest payments due to lower debt levels, the company effectively needs very little growth to reach its targets: This year's $1.225B guidance plus $200m of capex reduction, plus about $75m of interest savings already makes exactly $1.5B with zero growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sirius XM will reduce leverage by about 0.5x EBITDA by 2027, which means a net debt reduction of about $1.3B. This also looks very achievable, given the current and expected FCF level.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some near-term excitement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, one of the main drivers of today's rally was probably the talk around the company's spectrum assets. Since Sirius XM (roughly speaking) owns about twice as much spectrum as it needs, there is a huge monetization opportunity. While an outright sale is complicated, probably not even smart to do (as it would create some technical and regulatory problems), the fastest way to make money from this asset is through third-party partnerships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent months, management has repeatedly pointed to such opportunities during conference calls and investor conferences, and today's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835409-sirius-xm-holdings-inc-siri-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> seemed to bring even greater intensity to this subject. It actually sounded like there is some concrete near-term opportunity in sight, with a potential announcement not too far away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since nobody really knows how big such an announcement would be, which figures it would involve and how it would impact the stock's fundamentals, some short covering is probably the prudent thing to do.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Sirius XM's effective turnaround is still not there – the market would need to see increasing subscriber numbers for a couple of quarters – investors are probably seeing that subscriber dynamics are not the only and maybe not even the most important thing to watch here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I explained in my recent article on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4747848-sirius-xm-what-is-berkshires-endgame\">Berkshire's likely endgame</a>, if SIRI doesn't deteriorate <em>rapidly</em>, this investment can still deliver good results. It is a classic value investment: The spectrum assets, its real estate in most of the U.S. car fleet, its low-churn subscriber base, and, last but not least, its robust FCF generation coupled with buybacks can yield decent investment results even with a slowly declining subscriber base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent quarter has given some substance to that theory, and highlighted the possibility that (1) subscribers might even grow again, while (2) the company might surprise with some unexpected spectrum-related capital inflow and/or moat-enhancing partnership.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why the stock rallied.</p>",
