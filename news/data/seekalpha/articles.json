Last year, Chord set a goal of converting 80% of its inventory to long laterals. I'm happy to report that we achieved that goal by year-end 2025, which was earlier than expected, and is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"633\" height=\"893\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chord Energy IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHRD/sec-filings\">CHRD’s latest report</a>, we see a strong balance sheet, with a net leverage of ~0.6x as of the latest report, and also no maturities until all the way in 2030 (and 2033), which I believe leaves significant room for more debt if they want to ramp up their expansion through another big acquisition or other developments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1269\" data-height=\"729\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chord Energy IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding Chord’s capital returns, I remain a big fan of their balanced approach, with the company prioritizing their balance sheet and leverage over returns, targeting 75%+ of adjusted FCF while the leverage is below 0.5x, 50%+ while the leverage is below 1x (nowadays), or just the base dividend plus potential for other returns when the leverage is above 1x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a note, their selected peers currently stand at a leverage of 1.1x, while the SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Expl &amp; Prod ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Expl &amp; Prod ETF\">XOP</a>) is at 1.7x, so the fact that they are well below that and are still taking a very careful approach remains yet another factor that highlights their quality, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the Q4 performance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557362-chord-energy-declares-1_30-dividend\">CHRD has recently declared a $1.30/share quarterly dividend</a> (the base), which places them at a roughly 5% yield today, representing roughly $295 million per year, alongside $10 million in buybacks for the quarter, for a very solid ~48% payout ratio, in line with the target. However, if we assume an improvement in leverage and a 75% payout ratio on the $700 million FCF they expect in 2026, we’re talking about $525 million in total, meaning a yield of roughly 9%, which is not bad at all in such an environment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To update a key development started in the previous analysis, I want to begin this segment by quickly mentioning the situation in Venezuela. Under the current conditions, I believe Exxon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) characterized Venezuela’s oil landscape very well when they <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/09/venezuela-is-uninvestible-for-now-exxon-ceo-tells-trump-in-white-house-meeting-00720198\" rel=\"nofollow\">called it “uninvestable,”</a> as we should keep in mind that it’s true that the country’s oil reserves are massive, but any operations there will require massive investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, we’re not only talking about one of the heaviest oils on the planet (lots of refining needed), but the infrastructure there is very old, likely the remnants of what American companies left there before they were nationalized (in 1976), with some upgrades made over time. In this oil environment, it’s very hard to find the funds (CAPEX-cutting environment) and the risk appetite to develop something in the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sure, things can improve in the long term and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/venezuelas-acting-president-signs-overhaul-easing-state-control-of-oil-industry-into-law\" rel=\"nofollow\">the country is working on an overhaul of their oil industry</a> after Maduro was removed, but nothing guarantees that these operations <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2026/01/five-keys-to-understanding-venezuelas-oil-history/#:~:text=Foreign%20companies%20continued,the%2020th%20century\" rel=\"nofollow\">won’t be taken again</a> or economic conditions won’t change. After all, Trump’s term is over in about 3 years, and we can never know who comes to power next (in either country) and potentially cut the US’ grip that’s just now being developed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are several other uncertain factors that the market will pay attention to. If things were that simple, then this wouldn’t have been one of the most volatile commodities on the planet, after all. For example, although <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-likely-maintain-oil-production-pause-march-prices-climb-sources-say-2026-01-26/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OPEC+ continued to go for their previously planned halt in production hikes</a> shortly after the Maduro operation, that’s providing some clarity only until the end of Q1, and a switch here can cause pressure on the price of oil once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, very <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2026/02/25/opec-to-consider-137000-bpd-oil-output-increase-for-april-reuters-sources-say/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent reports</a> indicate that OPEC+ may decide to raise oil output by 137,000 bpd starting in April 2026 in order to meet peak summer demand, which can be only the beginning of more near-term pressure on the price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the situation in Iran is also developing, while the war in Ukraine is taking steps towards an eventual end, which can even lead to somewhat of the opposite of the price jumps, disruptions, and sanctions that came afterward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, even before the current situation, we saw J.P. Morgan’s warning saying that we could even see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525655-brent-crude-could-slide-to-the-30s-without-production-cuts-jp-morgan-says\">oil drop into the $30s by 2027</a> in a massive oversupply scenario, which could be terrible for a company like CHRD, as the <a href=\"https://ir.chordenergy.com/2025-09-15-Chord-Energy-Announces-Strategic-Acquisition-of-Williston-Basin-Assets#:~:text=Inventory%20Quality%3A%C2%A0Low%20average%20NYMEX%20WTI%20breakeven%20economics%20%28%2440s%29%20compete%20at%20the%20front%2Dend%20of%20Chord%27s%20program%20and%20lower%20the%20weighted%2Daverage%20breakeven%20of%20Chord%27s%20portfolio%3B\" rel=\"nofollow\">Williston Basin inventory acquired recently,</a> for example, has a breakeven in the $40s.

If we start with their $700 million FCF in 2026 and, instead of the previous jump, assume a 4% CAGR until 2030, a 3% CAGR until 2035, and a 2.25% terminal growth rate, with a 15% discount rate and 56.84 million shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gets us to an intrinsic value of $103.39, which almost perfectly mirrors the current level, taking into account a massive discount rate and weak growth despite the company’s achievements, which I don’t consider correct.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRD remains a Strong Buy, being in a very solid financial position, with prudent management that’s been delivering great improvements in recent years and a solid yield on top.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks to keep in mind, as their breakeven costs are still elevated given the basin exposure, but the company is advancing rapidly in a very good direction, transforming significantly since it was formed, which I believe should warrant better valuations going forward.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a final note, especially given <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4545336-devon-energy-coterra-energy-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal-valued-at-58b\">the continued M&amp;A activity seen in the market</a>, I wouldn’t be surprised to see another peer try to acquire CHRD given the valuation, quality, and size.</p>",

The market has been focused in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the past year on gold miners, while other segments of the investing universe should also have taken some bandwidth.

After the 2022 invasion, Russia's reserves abroad were frozen.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>After Russia’s full-scale invasion, the U.S. and its allies froze Russian foreign exchange reserves in their jurisdictions. The Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force—consisting of the Group of Seven (G7), European Union (EU), and Australia—most recently estimated frozen reserves at $280 billion. Many experts (and the Central Bank of Russia) put the figure between $300 and $330 billion.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This move has made it clear to many foreign countries that dollar- and euro-denominated assets can have the same fate in the case of a conflict.

Note that gold miners are virtually not represented currently, but keep in mind this ETF is active and thus can choose to change holdings as valuations make sense.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is very new, but we can have a look at how it has done versus some other names in the space:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"727\" data-height=\"518\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Performance <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since its inception, METL has put in a performance very much in line with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDX\" title=\"VanEck Gold Miners ETF\">GDX</a>) and has underperformed the silver focused SIL. METL is more focused currently on the metal equities next in line for substantial rallies, namely copper and rare earths. We view the fund as a great allocator to the metals space, especially when considering higher prices for longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund portfolio managers have the flexibility to invest in equities associated with a wide range of metals thus can provide exposure to specific metals potentially positioned for outperformance based on market macro conditions and intrinsic valuation metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some analytics around this ETF are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AUM: $112 M</li> <li>Expense ratio: 0.89%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund does not have enough historical data to generate reliable risk analytics, but given the performance correlation with SIL and GDX, one can safely assume very similar risk statistics for now. METL will be able to generate better analytics long term due to its active management, so we are excited to see the name outperform as we move forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">METL is a new ETF from Sprott, focused on metals miners across the spectrum. The fund is active and thus can change its composition as it sees fit. The ETF is currently overweight copper and silver miners, with almost no gold miners present in the holdings. The fund has done very well since its recent inception (September 2025), being up over +50%. The name represents a great portfolio diversifier for individuals believing higher metal prices are here to stay for longer.</p>",

The precious metal is closing well above its early February monthly highs as metals caught a strong bid in today's action. <em>These are preparations for something happening over the weekend.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Week Ahead: NFP and PMIs all around the globe</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asia Pacific Markets: A condensed data package for APAC</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week should be exciting for APAC traders. Without counting geopolitics, macro traders will await three PMI reports for China. There has been a surprising drop in the data as of late, and the PBoC is talking about supporting their economy, not through market-wide stimulus but with targeted assistance. It will be interesting to see how it plays out in the data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Australian dollar will once again be on the front scene, between inflation surveys, a speech from Governor Bullock, PMIs, trade data and GDP. It's going to be a very essential week for the 2026 FX leader. Let's see if it holds up to the test.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Japan, traders will be listening closely to Governor Ueda's speech on Monday night. A hike could be coming towards mid-month for the Bank of Japan, and he upped his tone recently regarding the possibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>With two new decision-makers entering the Bank of Japan in the next months, it could be his last opportunity to build some form of consensus.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe and UK Markets: Eurozone and Swiss Inflation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The heavy slate of data also spreads to Europe with inflation data (consumer prices and producer prices) releasing. Friday will also see the yearly data for EU GDP, so keep this one in check.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the largest culprit will be the Swiss inflation report, where traders should confirm whether negative rates will be a thing or not. A heavy test for FX markets.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">North American Markets: More PMIs, but most importantly, non farm payrolls</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week is going to be huge for North America. Without mentioning Iran, traders will receive a streak of PMIs from Canada and the US.

It offers a low-cost option to investors seeking both dividend income and potential capital growth. The ETF focuses on the top 80 high-dividend-yielding companies within the S&amp;P 500 Index. SPYD can serve as a core fund for building a diversified portfolio across asset classes.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>SPYD is a medium-sized ETF, now with $7.6 billion in assets under management as of February 25, 2026. That’s up from just $6.5 billion at the time of my previous analysis. The </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/expenses\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>annual expense ratio</span></a><span> is low at only 7 basis points, while the trailing 12-month </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/dividends/scorecard\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>dividend yield</span></a><span> is high at 4.11%, about 2.9 percentage points above that of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/momentum/performance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>Share-price momentum</span></a><span> has improved markedly just in the last handful of months, now earning the product a B- ETF Grade in that category by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system (it was a D- back in November). From a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/risk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>risk perspective</span></a><span>, SPYD scores decently, but high exposure to cyclical and defensive sectors can bring about a unique set of risks, namely steep negative alpha when the Mag 7 take off. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For now, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/liquidity\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>liquidity</span></a><span> is quite strong. Average daily volume is north of 1.8 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is very tight at just two basis points, per State Street Funds.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For an update on the portfolio, the 2-star, Gold-rated ETF by Morningstar plots (not surprisingly) on the far-left side of the style box, indicating its weight toward the value style. There is no growth access, while more than 80% of the allocation is classified as SMID-cap by Morningstar. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While the fund is largely unexposed to some of today’s biggest AI risks (as seen in the software industry), macroeconomic factors play a large role in price action. Interest rates are particularly key. In general, the lower Treasury yields go, the more attractive high-yield equities become.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>On valuation, SPYD’s price-to-earnings ratio is very compelling at 13.7x, but the long-term earnings growth rate is also modest, near 6%. I would not be surprised to see EPS estimates get taken higher, as broader profit growth cascades across the so-called “real” economy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYD: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"804\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYD: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Zooming in on the sector breakdown, Real Estate is by far the largest stake.

Notice in the chart below that the fund is right near all-time highs. It scaled the November 2024 previous high-water mark after surging from November through the turn of this year. Now, with a rising long-term 200-day moving average, the bulls clearly control the primary trend. Price is above the 50 dma, which is higher than the 200 dma.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Also take a look at the volume by price profile on the left side of the graph. There should be major support if we see a pullback. For now, support is right near the current price, with a firmer layer between $45 and $45. I expect the current bull flag pattern to resolve higher, and it makes sense that the ETF is working off technical overbought conditions (as evidenced by the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>In terms of an upside target, a measured move objective to $67 is in play based on the depth of the Q4 2024 to April 2025 decline and subsequent breakout.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYD: Bullish Upside Breakout, Bull Flag, Rising 200dma</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYD: Bullish Upside Breakout, Bull Flag, Rising 200dma\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Stockcharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The Bottom Line</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I have a buy rating on SPYD.

The reasoning behind the risk-off flows was that US embassies in the Middle East had called for<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> their staff to prepare security measures over the weekend, leading to a spike in oil to $68 and a rough pre-open session.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dow Jones was leading indexes lower, dipping to -1.78% before rebounding. Benchmarks are now attempting to erase the entire overnight drop; however, this may prove difficult as traders prepare for a volatile session close, pulled on both sides by weekend risk and month-end flow volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rebound is strong, with recent Chicago PMI data (57.7 vs 52.8 exp) confirming that US data is far from weakening; quite the opposite, in fact. Produce prices have risen to 8-month highs amid elevated activity, further pressuring prices. This could prevent further rate cuts and hurt sentiment in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will prove challenging for risk sentiment, but looking at the immediate action, bulls and bears are just fighting within a range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's look at the technical situation by diving into today's session charts and key trading levels for the major US indices: the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Session's Stock Heatmap</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_Screenshot_2026-02-27_at_11.56.06AM.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"658\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_Screenshot_2026-02-27_at_11.56.06AM.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Current picture for the Stock Market (11:56 A.M.

This figure improves by several percentage points if the company is able to achieve the upper end of its synergy target.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a first step toward this goal, SM announced it was selling a gassier block of its Eagle Ford acreage for a sale price of $950 million. This asset sale presents a modest impact to overall production values but significantly improves the company's balance sheet and interest expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the combination of deleveraging and free cash flow improvements to lead to significant share price appreciation. I am establishing a price target of $35 per share by year end 2027. This supports an annualized 25% return plus dividends to support a Strong Buy recommendation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Release Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a standalone basis, SM executed well. The company generated $2.26B in full-year EBITDAX, valuing the base business at just 2.3 times full-year EBITDA. Additionally, the company paid down over $400 million in debt. In doing so, the company's leverage ratio was lowered to 1.05x, a very solid number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite these achievements, the focus of the year-end earnings conference call was on 2026 guidance and the details surrounding the go-forward plan following the merger with Civitas Resources. At a high level, this plan focuses on maximizing free cash flow at the expense of some volumes. This will allow the company the financial flexibility to start paying down the heavy debt burden that was absorbed from Civitas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More specifically, the company has slashed $450 million, or 14%, out of the 2025 CAPEX budget. The company will be dropping three rigs while focusing on oil-weighted locations. As a result, oil production is expected to climb modestly on a percentage basis. However, total production will be allowed to fall approximately 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This decline in total production is somewhat inflated due to the previously announced sale of the company's gassier Eagle Ford assets. Excluding this transaction, forward production would have only reduced by 8% at the planned investment rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"New Portfolio Activity\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">New Portfolio Activity <span>(SM Investor Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SM also provided an outline for future free cash flow deployment in 2026. The company announced a 10% dividend increase, bringing the company's yield up to 4%. The company also plans to continue to buy back shares, although this is expected to be the smallest aspect of the cash return framework.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The elephant in the room for this investment thesis is the company's goal to reduce debt. 80% of the free cash flow remaining after financing the dividend will be directed toward cleaning up the balance sheet. The size of this allocation corresponds directly to the scope of work that needs to be performed to complete repairs to the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With nearly $8B in total debt following the merger, SM's debt load currently dwarfs its own market cap ($5B). A strong effort to correct this issue is likely to result in an expanding multiple for the company that trades at industry low levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the key benefits of the merger with Civitas is that it allows SM to be on better terms with its lenders. The company has recently received two upgrades from <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-upgrades-sm-energy-to-bb-off-rating-watch-positive-outlook-stable-30-01-2026#:~:text=Fitch%20Ratings%20%2D%20Chicago%20%2D%2030%20Jan,be%20assumed%20by%20SM%20Energy.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fitch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3511227#:~:text=The%20merger%20will%20expand%20the,its%201.0x%20leverage%20target.\" rel=\"nofollow\">S&amp;P Global</a>, putting the company closer to achieving an investment-grade rating. Clearing this financial hurdle unlocks the opportunity for SM to trade at a significantly higher earnings multiple.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Synergy Progress And Upside Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the onset of the merger, SM revealed a plan to generate $200-$300m in synergies. Roughly one month after the transaction closed, SM announced that action had been taken on $185 million of that target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the image below, we can see that G&amp;A expense, as well as interest savings, represents the bulk of the improvements achieved to date. This amounts to much of the low hanging fruit from any merger of equals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CIVI C-suite has effectively been dismantled, leading to an easy G&amp;A victory. Additionally, the company received a $950 million cash injection from divesting part of its Eagle Ford acreage. This debt can be used to tackle the inherited debt, some of which carries a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/31603253\">9.6% interest rate</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operationally, the company has made initial strides in implementing efficiency improvements. However, it is far too early in the process to expect much progress in this area. As a result, only $60 million of the total $150 million opportunity set have embarked on any form of positive action.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the progress, the market appeared dissatisfied as the company's share price traded down 4% after the earnings release. However, the SM story is one of synergies and balance sheet recovery. Both of these objectives require time and patience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market appears to be missing the two key facts. The first fact is that SM's free cash flow is growing through synergies. The already announced $185 million improvement in free cash flow represents a 3.5% improvement in FCF. That number expands to 6% if the full $300 million is realized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second fact that is being missed is that 100% of that free cash flow is being allocated for the benefit of shareholders. Dividends and buybacks are obvious ways to pay back shareholders. However, the balance sheet recovery story is something that is often overlooked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most investors steer away from highly levered companies. On a pro forma basis, the company holds a leverage ratio of approximately 1.5-1.7x, making it higher than what the market considers ideal. However, since SM remains highly cash flow positive, this problem is fixable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In time, as SM repairs the balance sheet, leverage will be driven into the low 1.0 range per <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875442-sm-energy-company-sm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">management commentary</a>. These repairs allow SM to convert debt into shareholder equity and a higher share price. Further, as progress is achieved, the previously mentioned credit ratings can be improved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The simple act of paying down debt creates a flywheel effect. Interest expenses reduce, unlocking more free cash flow. Better leverage then leads to an investment-grade rating and a higher multiple for the company’s stock. Better credit ratings allow the company to refinance its most expensive debt, again unlocking more free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown below, SM trades at half the valuation level of its peers. Completing this process unlocks a significant re-rating that could allow the stock’s multiple to double over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, this process is long and slow. It requires consistent focus from the company to change the minds of the investment community. The next section will discuss why I have high confidence that SM can tackle this challenge.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2026 operational plan for SM is to focus on value and not volumes. The company will allow total production activity to drop while focusing on higher oil concentration targets. As a result, the company's oil production has been guided to account for 54% of total volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the cost front, SM is guiding for a noticeable increase in lease operating expenses. This is likely derived from producing fewer barrels. The net result is a mid-single-digit increase in operating costs for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this is more than offset by the higher margins afforded by the higher oil cut. As a result, I now model SM to produce between $750 million and $850 million in 2026 FCF. This model was created using a $60/barrel and $2.55/MCF price deck, providing modest upside through the company's hedging portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These hedges cover roughly half of SM's projected volumes at attractive prices in excess of this model. As a result, these hedges conservatively protect the company’s current 14% FCF yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By adding in the company’s efforts on value creation, this figure is easily expandable. The company’s base case improvement is expected to realize $200 million in free cash flow uplift. This clearly pushes the optimized version of the company into the 20% FCF yield territory.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent weeks, oil has enjoyed a resurgence on the back of renewed tensions between the US and Iran. This political premium is unlikely to last forever and thus exposes the energy sector to near-term headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this premium were to erode, the commodity would be forced to reconcile with an oversupplied market. While demand has remained resilient, supply is still dominating the market after OPEC+ fully ramped up production in mid-2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do not expect the commodity to break out of the $60/barrel range, thus limiting SM’s margins. Even though the company has solid hedges in place, the market is unlikely to overlook the near-term challenge should there be a price reversion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Key Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. SM Energy released its pro forma capital and production plans after the Civitas acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The company is targeting a significant CAPEX reduction as well as a higher concentration of oil production to improve margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. I project SM as generating 14% in its current form. Cash flow improvements through synergies and optimizations hold the potential to boost this figure to over 20% in the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. This strong free cash flow will be allocated to debt reduction. By reducing the debt, shareholders should expect a valuation re-rating as the company pushes to achieve an investment-grade credit rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. I hold a $35 price target due to this re-rating potential. This and the company’s 4% dividend yield are supportive of a Strong Buy recommendation.</p>",

Markets continued to rebound from post-“Liberation Day” lows as legal challenges, implementation delays, and immediate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> economic impacts remained muted. While tariffs and other policy outcomes are still pending, we should see some resolution from the Supreme Court in the coming months. However, financial markets remained confident in a solid economy, rangebound inflation, and early signs of easing geopolitical risks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. economic data continued to signal resilience despite a U.S. government shutdown that delayed or cancelled key releases. Once resolved, the post-shutdown data confirmed that certain trends remained intact: positive growth, contained inflation, and unemployment that held near historically low levels despite some downside surprises. This allowed the Federal Reserve (Fed) to resume easing, cutting rates by 25 basis points (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPS\" title=\"BPS Technology Public Company Limited\">BPS</a>) at both the October and December Federal Open Market Committee ('FOMC') meetings. The Fed has acknowledged that while elements of its mandate are in conflict, it has chosen to focus on protecting the labor market in the near term. Global monetary policy remains desynchronized, with divergences among the European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan. Geopolitical developments were mixed: volatility re-emerged in the Russia/Ukraine conflict, while the Middle East saw some signs of progress. China's military exercises late in the quarter around Taiwan were a reminder that tensions remain unresolved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing market rebound drove broadly positive financial performance for 4Q. Fixed income sectors posted gains as front-end interest rates declined, and most spread sectors outperformed U.S. Treasuries. The U.S. Treasury curve steepened, with the 2-year yield down by 13 bps, the 5-year yield down by 2 bps, the 10-year yield up by 2 bps, and the 30-year yield higher by 11 bps.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Performance Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund (Class I) returned 1.51% in the fourth quarter versus the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index return of 1.10%.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positive Contributors</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>U.S. Treasury Securities: The Fund's underweight to U.S. Treasuries had a positive impact as most spread sectors outperformed U.S. Treasuries and delivered excess returns.</li> <li>Emerging Markets ('EM') Sovereigns: Allocation and selection within EM sovereigns were positive.</li> <li>Investment Grade ('IG') Corporates: The Fund's underweight and selection were positive.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Detractors</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities ('RMBS'): Allocation to RMBS over agency mortgage-backed securities ('MBS') was negative.</li> <li>High Yield ('HY') Corporate Securities Selection: Selection versus the benchmark was negative.</li> <li>Asset-Backed Securities ('ABS') Selection: Selection versus the benchmark was negative.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Fund Strategy and Positioning</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Increased exposure to MBS, IG corporates, and cash.</li> <li>Reduced exposure to ABS, RMBS, and bank loans.</li> <li>In addition to changes to the Fund's sector allocation during the quarter, we continue to optimize positioning within sectors based on our view of the best relative value.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM Debt and Non-U.S. Exposure: The J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index ended 2025 on a strong note—its 3.29% return was supported by monetary easing, resilient technicals, and outperformance among select countries. High yield ('HY') credits led performance, while IG lagged amid modest spread volatility. Spreads tightened by 31 bps in 4Q to close the year at 253 bps. The J.P. Morgan CEMBI Global Diversified underperformed the J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified, returning 1.29% amid significant volatility in Brazilian corporates during October. Local markets returned 3.34%, aided by a softer U.S. dollar and improving inflation. The Fund's overall EM exposure was marginally lower in 4Q. The Fund maintained a preference for U.S. dollar assets and EM HY over EM IG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IG Corporates: IG corporate spreads widened 4 bps in 4Q to end 2025 in the high 70s, still at the very low end of the 20-year range. Yields were little changed at 4.81%. Supply was the big story as nearly $100 billion in issuance from large cloud providers set a new 4Q record. This caused some market indigestion even as demand drivers remained in place and flows stayed positive throughout the quarter. Credit metrics were stable while ratings drifted higher. BBBs are at their lowest percentage of the overall market in a decade. With valuations tight, we favor a defensive posture, with a preference for U.S. banks, utilities, and capital goods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HY Corporates: The Bloomberg High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Bond Index gained 1.31% in 4Q. Credit spreads were little changed, with the Index ending 1 bp tighter at 266 bps. The market continues to focus on inflation and its impact on rates, the outlook for artificial intelligence and related spending, and consumer spending. Finance companies, metals &amp; mining, and gaming outperformed during the quarter. Cyclical industries such as packaging, retailers, and buildings products lagged as lower-quality names declined sharply into year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Securitized: The securitized markets posted positive total and excess returns in 4Q, outperforming other credit sectors. Spreads tightened despite elevated issuance across all securitized sub-sectors as investors sought additional income and spread. Our exposure to agency MBS outperformed IG corporates as strong technicals, the Fed rate cut, and low rate volatility rewarded investors. While our securitized strategy continues to focus on up-in-quality credits such as agency MBS, we're also selectively exploring transactions that present promising yield opportunities lower in the capital stack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4Q <span>25 </span> Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermediate Bond Fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NAMFX\" title=\"Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermdt Bond Fund A\">NAMFX</a></span>) </h3> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1708\" data-height=\"759\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"4Q 25 Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermediate Bond Fund DATA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"284\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p></p> <p>Performance data quoted represents past performance.

The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt instruments may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer-term maturities. High Yield Fixed Income Securities (Junk Bonds): There is a greater risk of issuer default, less liquidity, and increased price volatility related to high yield securities than investment grade securities. Bank Loans: Bank loans may be unsecured or not fully collateralized, may be subject to restrictions on resale, may be less liquid and may trade infrequently on the secondary market. Bank loans settle on a delayed basis; thus, sale proceeds may not be available to meet redemptions for a substantial period of time after the sale of the loan. Foreign &amp; Emerging Markets: Investing in foreign securities, especially in emerging markets, subjects the portfolio to additional risks such as increased volatility, currency fluctuations, less liquidity, and political, regulatory, economic, and market risk. ABS/MBS: Changes in interest rates can cause both extension and prepayment risks for asset- and mortgage-backed securities. These securities are also subject to risks associated with the non-repayment of underlying collateral, including losses to the portfolio. Market Volatility: The value of the securities in the portfolio may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies and/or general economic conditions. Local, regional, or global events such as war or military conflict, terrorism, pandemic, or recession could impact the portfolio, including hampering the ability of the portfolio's manager(s) to invest its assets as intended.

We're going to be looking at the fund itself, how it's built and for what purpose, and all that great stuff, but I think what's even more important is why the fund is behaving the way it is, and whether that's sustainable for the long haul. Let's get started.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The FRDM Fund for Top EM Equities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just so you know <a href=\"https://freedometfs.com/frdm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">where the fund's coming from</a>, the \"freedom\" part refers to the portfolio strategy of weighting the equities using \"personal and economic freedom metrics\" as the basis for inclusion and allocation. Lady Liberty herself graces the ETF's webpage, and the fund seems to have distilled the level of protection provided to personal and economic freedom across 24 target EM countries and 87 individual metrics into a completely automated algorithm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This \"freedom-weighting\" is then applied to rank the top ten companies in each of these EM countries, after which a market-cap weighting is applied on top. The result is a portfolio of about 120 equities ranked by their freedom weights and market caps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Life + Liberty Index acts as the benchmark, so this is a simple index fund but with specific criteria being used to compile the index and FRDM's portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has an AUM of $2.97 billion as of February 26, with an expense ratio of 0.49%, or about average for the ETF universe. I'd have thought an automated portfolio that's little more than a fancy index fund would have much lower expenses, but that's not the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has been around since May 2019, so there's plenty of data to work with in terms of how it's performed on a long-term horizon, give or take.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The country exposure figures are pretty interesting, but I'd like to explore the fund's core philosophies of \"freedom-weighting\", capturing freedom metrics at the country level, and a default exclusion of state-owned corporations (must be less than 20% state-owned to qualify for inclusion). These three philosophies seem to feed into the belief that \"freedom makes better market\", so let's look at some of the quant elements that comprise</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1385\" data-height=\"782\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FRDM Website\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FRDM Website</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the fund's underlying investment principle seems to be that the freer the market, the more efficiently capital and labor can be deployed, the more sustainable the growth, and the quicker the bouncebacks from economic downturns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Has This Investment Philosophy Translated to Performance?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw how the fund has performed on a YTD basis, but what about since inception? Since we have nearly 7 years of data, its price and total returns for the since-inception period are pretty meaningful. Let's see what's what.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1217\" data-height=\"263\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"138\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRDM clearly outperformed the market on all timelines, even when the U.S. market was flat, and that's what we've been seeing over the past couple of months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Things look good historically, but that only means the fund has done its job of beating the market so far. What about in the future, which is our real goal here? To get to that, we'll need to check some of the top equities and see how they've been doing and whether or not their stocks still have steam to go higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assessing the Top Equities of FRDM</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>), and SK hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>), the top three make up a little less than one-fourth of the portfolio, or about 24%, so looking at their performances in the last reported period and the outlook for the next should give us a pretty good view of where FRDM is headed in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung reported <a href=\"https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/global/ir/docs/2025_4Q_conference_eng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings for Q4</a> and FY-25 in January, and it looks pretty good. Quarterly revenues and operating profits grew by an impressive 24%, while for the full year, revenues were up by 11%, EBITDA margin was up 2% to 26%, net margin grew to 14 basis points from 11 bps, and ROE was also up 2%, all on a YoY basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business as usual, nothing to worry about here, but the biggest growth engine right now is Device Solutions, under which the Memory segment is reported. That's where we have the strongest evidence of growth, and we're going to see that with SK hynix as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for Memory is also very positive, with growth still on the table for Q1-26 as well as FY-26. The Foundry business is expected to see a seasonal decline in Q1-26 (sequential basis), but the full-year expectation is that advanced nodes are going to drive double-digit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The seasonality theme seems to persist across other business segments like SDC (Samsung Display Corp.), where smartphone seasonal demand is expected to decline sequentially, and we could see some margin pressure from high-cost memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other than the key issue of memory availability and pricing pressure, I don't see anything that points to a poor FY-26, so that's great for the ETF because it invests in the KRX listing (Korean Exchange), not the ADR. Trading volumes for the ADR are also pretty low, so if you're thinking of investing in this company, the Korean listing is likely the better option. If your brokerage doesn't provide that access, the FRDM ETF is the next best thing because it's able to capture capital appreciation pretty effectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker also reported earnings in January, and the stock is already up over 13%. RSI isn't helping, and oscillators are indicating a neutral to bearish outlook, but <a href=\"https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-TSM/technicals/\" rel=\"noopener\">key MAs</a> show positive trends signaling a Buy, which is good for FRDM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1695\" data-height=\"491\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"185\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1805\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TradingView\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a fundamentals standpoint, TSMC is rock-solid, with a forward revenue growth expectation of 30% against a 10% median figure, and an even better 35% GAAP EPS outlook. The best part is a lack of correlation to the broad U.S. market. You'd expect that because of the EM-only portfolio, but for the purpose of our FRDM analysis, that's a good sign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1228\" data-height=\"275\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"143\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for SK hynix, the parent stock on the KRX is up 32% in the last month on the back of a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4543360-sk-hynixs-profit-surges-on-ai-memory-demand-to-form-ai-firm-in-us\">66% revenue bump</a> in Q4, YoY. Memory is hot right now, and hynix is experiencing the full force of the AI infrastructure boom. This stock's got a ways to go, so no running out of steam in the near future for sure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freedom Works, But Only Outside the U.S.!</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's ironic that an EM-based freedom ETF would do much better than equities in the 'free-est' market of all, the U.S., but that's the current reality. FRDM has lots of room to appreciate, and it adds a nice layer of icing with the 1.8% yield. Not a lot, but that's mainly because of the underlying NAV appreciation more than anything.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1194\" data-height=\"554\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peak yield was around 5% at the end of 2023, and the dividend payouts are still a little lumpy, but it does add a thin layer of downside protection for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'd rate FRDM a Buy based on this analysis, and my higher-level view is that EMs have a lot to offer that the U.S. market doesn't right now, so this is a good time to take advantage of the growth differentials between EMs and developed markets.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, it's companies like TSMC and hynix that are actually driving growth in U.S. markets, simply because of the fact that all the fastest-growing AI companies are buying products from them that nobody else is making at that scale and that level of advancement. Easy Buy for FRDM even if you only consider that one critical aspect.</p>",
