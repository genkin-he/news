During the first three quarters of 2025, no sales were recorded, while adjusted operating expenses have climbed from $8.8M in 2Q25 to $8.9M in 3Q25. This excludes the $3.2M in stock-based compensation, M&amp;A costs, and severance pay. The management expects 4Q25 adjusted OPEX to reach $13M-$15M, reflecting an accelerated hiring spree and commissioning activity at its Stillwater plant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we steer back to GAAP, we have to work with a noisy set of data. The net loss in 3Q25 was in fact $156.7M, or -$1.64 per share. This was mainly due to a $142M non-cash fair value adjustment on warrant and earn-out liabilities. In 2Q25, GAAP net loss was $142.5M, or -$1.54/share. The net loss is persistent with growing costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company finished the third quarter with $257.6M cash in hand and no significant debt. Operating cash flow burn was $21.1M during the first three quarters of 2025. Capex spend has been steadily increasing—$3M/$3.2M/$7.1M in 1Q/2Q/3Q of FY25. This was primarily for improving plant and equipment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recapitalization keeps it going</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January 2026, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/usa-rare-earth-announces-closing-120100873.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">USAR closed</a> a $1.5B PIPE deal, and issued 69.8M shares at $21.50, with Inflection Point as the anchor investor. Later in the same month, the company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/usa-rare-earth-enters-pact-for-1-6-billion-of-federal-funds-22626027\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a non-binding letter of intent with the U.S. Department of Commerce's CHIPS program, which led to up to $1.6B in funding that consists of $277M in proposed grants and $1.3B in senior secured loans. In return, 16.1M shares and ~17.6M warrants were issued to the DoC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The obvious drawback is dilution. As of the end of January, there were ~217.9M in outstanding shares, with up to 76.3M shares listed for resale, or about 35% of the total float. The share dilution effect is a strong overhang on the stock, as evidenced by the 12% drop in the share price on the PIPE closing day.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reducing reliance on China's rare earth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's Stillwater plant in Oklahoma is a magnet manufacturing plant expected to be in commission in 1Q26. The initial production rate is 600 metric tons/annum (tpa), before scaling to 1200 tpa, and finally to a full capacity of 4,800 tpa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">USAR acquired the UK's Less Common Metals (LCM) in November 2025 for $100M in cash and 6.54M in shares. This acquisition will bring in 1,500 tpa of NdFeB strip cast capacity, expanding to 2,000 tpa in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fueled by geopolitical fears</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After China <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions\" rel=\"nofollow\">imposed</a> export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements in April 2025, it further expanded them in October 2025 and subsequently suspended the latter until November 2026. China's RE magnet exports fell by ~75% in the two months following the initial controls, and as a result, neodymium prices have <a href=\"https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/neodymium-prices/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\">surged</a> roughly <span>124%</span> since January 2025, to $214.80/kg in February 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is a neodymium price chart in CNY (¥).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"734\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Neodymium price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Neodymium price <span>(Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence.\"</p> <p>Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick (<a href=\"https://nam.org/commerce-department-injects-6-billion-into-domestic-rare-earths-35594/\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only is the funding pipeline credible, but it has garnered bipartisan support as it is a national urgency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let's pause and look at fundamentals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gap between the company's aspirational <a href=\"https://investors.usare.com/static-files/504a8a9a-b867-4a1b-bee4-99b651cb0144\" rel=\"nofollow\">targets</a> (pp. 10) and execution is still pretty wide. By 2030, the management expects to hit $2.6B in revenue, $1.2B in EBITDA, and $900M in FCF. So far, market analysts have only put FY26E revenue at ~$51M, increasing to $281M in FY27E and to $858M in FY28E. EBITDA is not expected to turn positive until FY28E when it will reach $62M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of 3Q25, the Stillwater plant has yet to produce its first magnet, let alone being able to manufacture at scale. Any further status update on its timeline to begin commissioning in 1Q26 would be welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its Round Top deposit in West Texas, which has heavy rare earths, gallium, and other critical minerals waiting to be extracted, still has to pass its pre-feasibility study, aimed to be done by 3Q26. Thus, we do not expect any revenue contribution here until at least 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic viability of domestic RE producers rests strangely on the actions of China.</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As China's export control on REs has sparked urgency on domestic suppliers, the spigot is still very much under the control of China. A relaxation of its supply can cause rare earth prices to crash, as with any commodity. China has shown that it will use its dominance in rare earths as a negotiation tactic in trade talks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A competitive landscape</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MP Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>) is a larger competitor valued at $10.4B, has ~$276M in revenue in the past twelve months. It operates the sole active rare earth mine in North America. It also has close ties with the Department of War. However, USAR has an edge in heavy rare earths, which MP doesn't produce at scale. Despite this, MP still has multiple years of a head start and is expected to turn a profit as early as FY26E, according to market estimates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current levels, USAR trades at 36x FY26E earnings, which is high for an industrial miner, but possibly justifiable since rare earths are a sensitive, politicized commodity. Looking further out at $858M in FY28E revenue, the market estimates imply an FY28E P/S of 2.1x. We sense that this valuation is still on the expensive side—market estimates ($62M EBITDA on $858M revenue) imply a 29x FY28E EV/EBITDA multiple, whereas industrial miners tend to trade below 10x EV/EBITDA even during bull markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, dilution is a big overhang for the stock. There are still $280M+ of warrants to be exercised on the balance sheet. The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1970622/000197062226000009/usar-20260128.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">SEC filings</a> contain risk factors that explicitly mention \"significant dilution associated with the expected U.S. Government investment and PIPE transaction.\" Management has indicated it will need additional capital to fund the full four-line buildout at Stillwater (at least $250M in capex plus $50M-$100M in working capital) and the Round Top development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are not bearish on domestic rare earth suppliers due to geopolitical tailwinds, significant government support and funding, and ultimately the strategic importance of such minerals to defense, EVs, wind, and semiconductors. That said, current valuations are off-putting, and we believe more production milestones need to be reached for us to consider an investment that targets profitability in FY28+.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We rate USAR as a HOLD. We look forward to its next earnings release on March 19 to learn more about its progress at Stillwater.</p>",

SPYM is less popular than SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), but it is a very large and liquid ETF, with $107.6 billion in assets under management and an average daily volume of $923 million.

They are necessary for new readers to understand the metrics. If you are used to this series or if you are short of time, you can skip them and go to the charts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Base Metrics</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I calculate the median value of five fundamental ratios in every sector: Earnings Yield (\"EY\"), Sales Yield (\"SY\"), Free Cash Flow Yield (\"FY\"), Return on Equity (\"ROE\"), Gross Margin (\"GM\"). All are calculated on trailing 12 months. For all these ratios, higher is better, and negative is bad. EY, SY and FY are medians of the inverse of Price/Earnings, Price/Sales and Price/Free Cash Flow. They are better for statistical studies than price-to-something ratios, which are unusable when the \"something\" is close to zero or negative (for example, companies with negative earnings). I also calculate two momentum metrics for each group: the median monthly return (RetM) and the median annual return (RetY).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I prefer medians rather than averages because a median splits a set into a good half and a bad half. Capital-weighted averages are skewed by extreme values and the largest companies. As a consequence, these metrics are designed for stock-picking rather than index investing.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Value and Quality Scores</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Historical baselines are calculated as the averages over a look-back period of 11 years for all metrics. They are noted respectively EYh, SYh, FYh, ROEh, GMh. For example, the value of EYh for technology in the table below is the 11-year average of the median Earnings Yield of S&amp;P 500 tech companies.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The Value Score \"VS\" is the average difference in % between the three valuation ratios (EY, SY, FY) and their baselines (EYh, SYh, FYh). In the same way, the Quality Score \"QS\" is the average difference between the two quality ratios (ROE, GM) and their baselines (ROEh, GMh). </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>VS may be interpreted as the percentage of undervaluation or overvaluation relative to the baseline (positive is good, negative is bad). This interpretation must be taken with caution: the baseline is an arbitrary reference, not a supposed fair value. The formula assumes that the three valuation metrics are of equal importance, except in energy and utilities, where the Free Cash Flow Yield is ignored to avoid some inconsistencies. VS and QS</em><em> are capped between -100 and +100</em><em> when the calculation goes </em><em>beyond </em><em>th</em><em>ese</em><em> value</em><em>s</em><em>.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Current data</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next table shows the metrics and scores as of writing.

class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interpretation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A hypothetical S&amp;P 500 median company is overvalued by 13% relative to historical averages since 2015. Its quality score is close to the historical baseline. Median valuation ratios calculated as the inverse of yields are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Price/Earnings: 27.47</li> <li>Price/Sales: 3.18</li> <li>Price/Free Cash Flow: 42.55</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The energy sector has the highest value and quality scores since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4483198-ivv-sp-500-dashboard-for-february\">February 2022</a>. Real estate is undervalued by 13% based on 11-year averages and is close to its quality baseline. Healthcare is almost at its historical baseline regarding both value and quality. Consumer staples, communication, and financials are overvalued by less than 10%. Overvaluation may be offset by a good quality score for financials. Technology, consumer discretionary, and utilities are overvalued by 17% to 19%, with a good quality score for consumer discretionary and utilities. Industrials and materials are overvalued by 27% and 32%, respectively. The latter is the least compelling sector from a fundamental point of view, with both the lowest value and quality scores.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 performance was significantly skewed by mega-caps in 2025, but the bias reversed recently to give quite balanced 12-month returns in the cap-weighted index (17% measured on SPYM), the equal-weight index (15.7% measured on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Eql Wght ETF\">RSP</a>) and the index median (13.3% reported in the table above).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table above is not only useful to calculate value and quality scores. It may also help spot companies with attractive value relative to their peers. For example, the EY column tells us that a large consumer staples company with an earnings yield above 0.0364 (or price/earnings below 27.47) is in the better half of the sector regarding this metric. A dashboard list is sent every month to Quantitative Risk &amp; Value members with companies standing in the better half among their peers regarding the three valuation metrics. The companies listed below are part of the list sent to QRV members for March.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCL\" title=\"Carnival Corporation &amp; plc\">CCL</a></p></td> <td><p>Carnival Corp.</p></td> <td><p>DISCRETIONARY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APA\" title=\"APA Corporation\">APA</a></p></td> <td><p>APA Corp.</p></td> <td><p>ENERGY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a></p></td> <td><p>PayPal Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>FINANCIAL</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UHS\" title=\"Universal Health Services, Inc.\">UHS</a></p></td> <td><p>Universal Health Services, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>HEALTHCARE</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a></p></td> <td><p>Lockheed Martin Corp.</p></td> <td><p>INDUSTRIAL</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM\" title=\"Newmont Corporation\">NEM</a></p></td> <td><p>Newmont Corp.</p></td> <td><p>MATERIALS</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LW\" title=\"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\">LW</a></p></td> <td><p>Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>STAPLES</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IT\" title=\"Gartner, Inc.\">IT</a></p></td> <td><p>Gartner, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>TECH</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EIX\" title=\"Edison International\">EIX</a></p></td> <td><p>Edison International</p></td> <td><p>UTIL</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is part of a larger rotational model with a positive bias on the long-term, not the result of in-depth stock analysis.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Cineplex has always been a story of divestment and deleveraging, something quite different from Marcus, as I showed you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But despite the good results, I told you I was targeting a range of $20 to $23.50 in one or two years. So, we still have an upside of ~20 to 25% until then, which, added to the mid-digit shareholder yield I was projecting, gives us a fairly large margin of safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, how's the thesis going?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Theatres: Normalization in Sight?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I, and a few other folks, have recently returned to the cinema, the narrative that many have tried to sell—that there will be a return to pre-pandemic numbers this year—is a lie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we add up the <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2025/?ref_=bo_yl_table_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">domestic box office</a> for the entire year, we arrive at something slightly above $8.6 billion (only 1% above 2024 but almost 24% below 2019).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You could even argue that 2019 isn't such a comparable year, since many major releases came out, like Avengers: Endgame and The Lion King, but if you look back, in almost every pre-pandemic year the domestic box office exceeded $10 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"730\" data-height=\"256\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Domestic box office by year\" width=\"640\" height=\"224\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Domestic box office by year <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides not having normalized yet, the box office also hasn't reached the $9 billion projected by some <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65043071/\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysts</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you ask me, I think more was expected from some films with old superhero formulas like Captain America and <a href=\"https://cosmicbook.news/superman-box-office-vs-batman-man-of-steel-fantastic-four\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Animated films like 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' together grossed almost 10% of the total box office, which corroborates the thesis that family films have been much more profitable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I told you in my last two articles on Marcus, FY 2026 will be full of these family films like Zootopia 2 (which was released at the end of November and has already <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2026/?ref_=bo_yl_table_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">grossed</a> $86.3 million, something like $928,000 per day), Toy Story 5, Super Mario Galaxy, and others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251487393236_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1228\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251487393236_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top 5 highest grossing films so far in 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"208\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251487393236_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251487393236_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251487393236_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251487393236_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Top 5 highest grossing films so far in 2026 <span>(<span></span></span>Box Office Mojo<span>)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All are sequels, of course. Even so, all should surpass $300 million in domestic box office (something that only six films managed to surpass last year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my estimates (considering Avengers: Doomsday will only be released in December), I think they could surpass that $9 billion estimate to something closer to $9.5 billion, with cheaper films (like The Housemaid and Wuthering Heights) boosting Gen Z and Millennial viewership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what about FY 2027?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many say this year will be even better, with strong family titles like Frozen 3, Shrek 5 (that one I'll definitely want to see), and Minions 3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Could this be the catalyst to push domestic box office numbers above $10 billion? I wouldn't venture to say, but there's a chance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Marcus, they achieved sales of $123.8 million in Q4 FY 2025, an increase of approximately 2.1% compared to the same period last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Quarterly numbers\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"617\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Press Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond the one-off effect of the release of the film '<a href=\"https://mkefilm.org/films/69459193a9fb3a42aed4908a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Song Sung Blue</a>' (a very important film for the Milwaukee community in particular), Marcus has been able to see revenue growth through pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at the KPIs for the quarter, visitation fell 5.7% and was fully offset by a 12.7% increase in the average ticket price. Along with that, F&amp;B per capita also jumped 7.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, they outperformed the national average by a good chunk of 760 bp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notice that this isn't the traditional expansion (the kind we saw even before the pandemic) of organic growth via volume, nor the previous low-price strategies of afternoon matinees. This is a premiumization strategy, and, given the elasticity of demand, it's working quite well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we consider that small jump in the year's box office and Marcus achieving some gains in pricing and cross-selling on family films, I imagine that instead of Theatres revenue growing at a low-single-digit rate as it did in FY 2025, it will increase to a mid-single-digit rate (something between 4 and 6%), taking them to $481.2 to $490.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big question would be the margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that premium push, they lifted the operating margin in the division from 4.9% to 6.3%. If that trend holds, mid-to-high-single-digit margins don't seem out of reach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Answering the question I posed at the beginning of this section, if it happens, the normalization of box office revenue would occur in early 2027, with Marcus gaining market share while the industry continues to compete on price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Paramount Helped Theatre Operators</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A piece of good news for theater operators that came out in the media today (February 27th, the day I'm writing this article) was the long-awaited Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558365-paramount-wins-the-bidding-war-for-warner-bros-as-netflix-walks-away\">deal</a> with Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And, to be honest, I didn't follow the intricacies of it. That's not exactly my area of ​​expertise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But since I cover Marcus and other operators in this industry, Paramount buying Warner Bros. instead of Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) saved them a lot of headaches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To better understand this, we have to go back to David Ellison's <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/news/paramounts-david-ellison-commits-to-minimum-45-day-theatrical-window-in-letter-to-uk-creatives/5213433.article\" rel=\"nofollow\">statements</a> during the bidding war.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">He explicitly said:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>There will be a guaranteed minimum window of 45 days before releases go to streaming (more or less what it was in the post-pandemic period, when they reduced it from ~80 to 90 days);</li> <li>For major box office hits (I imagine films grossing over $300 million domestically), the idea is that the window should be 60 to 90 days;</li> <li>Paramount produces approximately 30 films annually for theatrical release.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at it bluntly, if they actually follow through on these promises, of course—this would extend Paramount's average window of ~30 days, which is more than a week shorter than the industry average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This all seems like a win for the establishment and, consequently, for Marcus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's no doubt that Netflix would try its best to push very short windows, further shortening the theatrical lifespan of each film.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's fair to wonder if Paramount can maintain that volume of releases every year, like what happened with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) and Fox post-merger, but I think that's the lesser of two evils.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hotels: Smart Allocation and What to Expect in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hotels are also holding up well, especially assets that have just come out of renovations, like the Hilton Milwaukee.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you've read my write-ups on casinos like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867203-monarch-casino-capital-returns-today-potential-m-and-a-tomorrow\">Monarch</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCRI\" title=\"Monarch Casino &amp; Resort, Inc.\">MCRI</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867488-boyd-gaming-2026-is-the-investment-year\">Boyd Gaming</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYD\" title=\"Boyd Gaming Corporation\">BYD</a>), you'll know that the operators outperforming the national average are those that are constantly renovating their assets. One of the few local assets that hadn't been renovated, <a href=\"https://orleans.boydgaming.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Orleans</a>, hampered the entire segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take the <a href=\"https://tourismanalytics.com/lasvegas-statistics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strip</a> as an example. Operators that aren't upscale are seeing a significant drop in ADR and, ultimately, RevPAR. But this is happening elsewhere too, like in the South (Houston is a good example) and even in the Midwest, where Marcus has most of its assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to data they revealed in the earnings call, in the U.S. RevPAR increased by only 0.8% (ADR-driven, of course), and in the Midwest, Marcus's competing hotels fell by 2% in FY 2025 as a whole.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the numbers they pulled in the last quarter, you can see they outperformed the national average by a large chunk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ADR increased 5.6% (driven by renovations and premiumization of certain assets), and occupancy fell only 1.2% to 60.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Marcus aimed and hit the 'k-shaped economy' at a very opportune time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RevPAR grew 3.5%, about 550 bp higher than competitors in the Midwest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You can also see the full-year effects of the renovations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With rooms closed part of the year, Hotels revenue grew only 2.6% in the full FY 2025, with the adjusted EBITDA margin remaining virtually flat year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, but if they premiumized their room offering, why did margins shrink?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's simple. Some rooms remained closed during the renovation period, as well as certain areas like the convention center and part of the lobby. Since fixed costs remained stable, it's understandable that they would be less diluted while assets are under renovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the entire FY 2026, management expects RevPAR growth in the low-single-digits, more or less stable with Q4 FY 2025 (likely with some pressure on occupancy and ADR increasing). But the difference here is that bookings for this year are ~3% higher than FY 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I had to make a definitive prediction here, I'd say revenue would continue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits ($304 to $312.9 million) and margins would be slightly fatter compared to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other hotel chains, the World Cup won't be a huge boost here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Only Kansas City was chosen to host games, and since Marcus hasn't had properties there since 2015 (it sold the Phillips Hotel to focus on other markets), we probably won't see a very strong increase in bookings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Good Old Cash Generation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, my midpoint revenue projections for FY 2026 are approximately $800 million, closely matching the consensus of $796.5 million that Wall Street is targeting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since they've been surprised every quarter recently, I'd say I'll stick with my projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Premiumization efforts should push the EBITDA margin to ~13% (it's been hovering at 12.8% for the last two years), which would give us a full-year EBITDA of $104 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the same 85% conversion rate I used in the last analysis, we could project an OCF of $88.4 million. That time we needed to project Capex, but now we know it should be between $50 and $55 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This slightly reduces our previous FCF projection of $40 to $45 million to $33.4 to $38.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even so, if we project dividends of $0.32 per share annually (a return of $9.8 million counting on the 30.7 million shares outstanding), they would be covered at ~3.6x the midpoint of the FCF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If they use another $10 million to repurchase shares at ~$20 per share (being a little more conservative here), they would repurchase and retire 500,000 shares (buyback yield of just over 1.6%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are still left with a low-to-mid-single-digit shareholder yield. But since I believe they will soon increase dividends back to what they were before the pandemic, I'm aiming for a mid-single-digit yield very soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still Cheap?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though I think my previous price target of $20 to $23.50 is quite current, I believe we could take a look at the P/CF since these numbers are right in front of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming the buybacks do reduce the outstanding shares to 30.2 million and the OCF comes in at $88.4 million (OCF per share of $2.92), Marcus's 5-year average multiple indicates that they usually trade at ~8.2x that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at the pre-pandemic period and imagine a scenario of normalization ahead, the price target is only slightly above my projections at ~$23.90 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will reiterate my '<strong>Buy</strong>' rating on Marcus, eyeing this minimum 20% upside and a low-to-mid-single-digit shareholder yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unless we head into a recession, the combination of a strong FY 2026–FY 2027 film slate and ongoing hotel premiumization makes this investment case look less risky from here. I also support the M&amp;A thesis in the Midwest given the low leverage of the balance sheet.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

All the G10 central banks except the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meet in March, and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> none are likely to change policy.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China formalizes its next Five-Year Plan. In the US, the Supreme Court's ruling that the president's use of emergency powers to levy widespread tariffs is not legal was not unexpected, and the administration's \"Plan B\" is gradually being unveiled. The UK government faces an early electoral test. Japan has already shown how quickly crowded trades unwind when the political narrative shifts. The political cycle is no longer background noise. It is part of the macro regime.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China: Resilience as Strategy</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The National People’s Congress will translate party guidance into the 2026–2030 Five-Year Plan. The themes are familiar: innovation, technological self-reliance, green development, and supply-chain security. What has changed is emphasis. Resilience now stands alongside growth. National security is embedded in economic planning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expect multi-year support for semiconductors, AI, advanced manufacturing, and green technologies. “Dual circulation” remains the framework: strengthen domestic demand and indigenous capability while maintaining external ties that serve national objectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For markets, three implications follow. First, industrial policy is structural. Subsidies, directed lending, and procurement policy are long-term commitments, not cyclical levers. Second, foreign firms in sensitive sectors face higher regulatory and political hurdles. Access is increasingly conditional.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, trade friction is hardwired into the system. Even absent new sanctions or tariffs, subsidy regimes and security controls keep tensions elevated. China is not retreating from global trade. It is reshaping it around strategic autonomy. “Business as usual” is fading as a baseline assumption.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>United States: The Creaky Tariff Floor</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“Liberation Day” implied peak effective tariffs near 28%, up from roughly 3% at the start of 2025. Since then, pauses, carve-outs, and substitutions have lowered the realized burden. Effective rates appeared to be around 12-14%. That is still the highest sustained level since the 1930s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Supreme Court ruled against the administration's use of emergency powers to levy most of the tariffs. While many expected the court's decision, reports suggested that some businesses sold their refund rights to hedge funds and non-bank financial institutions. The court sent the issue of refunds back to the lower courts. Shortly after the decision was announced, President Trump unveiled Plan B: a 10% across-the-board tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to address balance-of-payments problems. Without Congressional support for the tariffs, the president's authority is limited to 150 days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following day, Saturday, February 21, President Trump raised the general levy to 15%. The legality may be challenged. On one level, the US does not have a balance of payment problem. Under floating exchange rates, the current account is offset by the capital account in the balance of payments. Rather than the adjustment being made by transferring gold, the adjustment is made by capital flows to offset the broad trade deficit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We suspect the deterioration of the US net international investment position would pass legal muster, and it would take more than 150 days to exhaust a legal challenge. And it is not clear in the first place that the judiciary will challenge the executive claim of an emergency. The Supreme Court's ruling on the tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not challenge the emergency status but the power to tariff under it. Most of the other tariff authority will require the administration to work with Congress, but the Republican majorities are narrow, and there is little room for dissent in the ranks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then there is monetary policy. With the investigation into the Federal Reserve continuing, the confirmation process for Kevin Warsh may be delayed, but if all goes according to plan, the meeting he chairs will be in June, and the Fed funds futures market has a strong chance of a cut then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We suspect that a Warsh-led Federal Reserve will allow the administration to pursue two other transformative policies and will take some time to unfold. First, there is already speculation about a new Federal Reserve-US Treasury accord, which in some ways reverses the prevailing one from the early 1950s that recognized greater operational independence for the central bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, there may be an attempt to revalue gold, which is being carried at about $42.20 a troy ounce. In theory, it seems reasonable. However, setting such a volatile commodity at or near market prices does not seem prudent. And some decision-making rules to address revaluation or devaluation should also be part of the decision. The Treasury would present new gold certificates to the Federal Reserve, which would credit the Treasury's account accordingly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>United Kingdom: Political Premium Returns</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The UK has two vulnerabilities: politics and economics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prime Minister Starmer faces May local elections that will be read as an early referendum on fiscal restraint and incremental reform. Real incomes remain pressured. Public services are strained. Patience is finite.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the Labour Party, Starmer's challengers are on the left. The Greens carried the Gorton and Denton special election at the end of February. Poor results in the May elections could strengthen the left wing of the Labour Party's hand. If trying to outflank the UK Reform Party did not work, maybe product differentiation could. However, the markets may object and could take it out on the Gilts and sterling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The UK economy ended 2025 with little forward momentum. The economy expanded by 0.1% quarter-over-quarter in Q4 25. Unemployment reached 5.2% in the quarter, the highest since the pandemic. Regular private sector wage growth slowed to 3.4%, the slowest in over five years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Japan: Crowded Trades Break Fast</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan offered a reminder that positioning matters as much as policy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sanae Takaichi’s snap-election victory delivered the LDP its largest majority since World War II. The platform blended fiscal support with medium-term consolidation and a cautious approach to BOJ normalization. It was continuity with a stronger mandate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going into the vote, the consensus was clear: looser fiscal policy, gradual BOJ tightening, weaker yen, and higher JGB yields. The trade was crowded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When uncertainty evaporated and post-election messaging leaned toward sustainability, markets reversed sharply. The yen rallied. Long-dated JGB yields fell as shorts were squeezed. The one-way weak yen narrative cracked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The lesson is broader than Japan. When a trade becomes a proxy for a global regime assumption - in this case, that Japan would tolerate persistent depreciation - it becomes vulnerable to even modest political shifts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Politics is not interfering with fundamentals. It is a fundamental.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bannockburn's World Currency Index</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_monthly_20chart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bannockburn's world currency index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"286\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_monthly_20chart.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_monthly_20chart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bannockburn's World Currency Index, a GDP-weighted basket of the currencies of the dozen largest economies, rose for the fourth consecutive month. It eked out a minor gain of about 0.15% after the nearly 1% gain in January. It looks poised to move higher, consistent with additional dollar losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of the G10 components but the Australian dollar fell against the greenback in February. Encouraged by a hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian dollar gained a little more than 2.1% in February. Sterling was the weakest. It tumbled about 1.5%. The yen lost a little more than half as much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging market currencies in Bannockburn's World Currency Index rose in February, with the noted exception of the Russian ruble, which fell almost 1.6%. The Brazilian real's nearly 2.7% gain was the strongest component in the BWCI last month, followed by the Chinese yuan, rose for the eighth consecutive month, and its nearly 1.4% gain put it slightly ahead of the Mexican peso's 1.35% appreciation. The Indian rupee's 1.1% gain was its largest since last April. The South Korean won was slightly better than flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bannockburn's World Currency Index reached its best level since September 2024, around 92.25 in mid-February, before consolidating. The consolidation looks broadly constructive, and we expect it to continue to trend higher. At the end of last year, we projected potential toward 94.75-96.00 this year, a roughly 5-7% gain, reflecting our bearish US dollar view. That still seems broadly fair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>U.S. Dollar:</strong> The Dollar Index fell to four-year lows in late January, near 95.50. It recovered in February and stalled around 98.00. This met the technical retracement objectives, and the risk is a return to the February low, about 96.50. A break re-targets the January low. Sentiment towards the dollar remains fragile, and the preferences revealed by the administration's policies are consistent with a weaker dollar. Still contrary to the \"sell America\" mantra in the media, the Treasury's International Capital report states that foreign investors were net buyers of $1.35 trillion of US stocks and bonds in 2025, the most since 2022. Yet, studies suggest that the dollar exposure was hedged. Comments from numerous Fed officials have encouraged the market to push back the first cut until July. At the end of January, the Fed funds futures strip implied an almost 87% chance of a cut in June, which could be the first meeting Warsh chairs if the confirmation process were timely. It is being threatened by the ongoing investigation into the Fed's renovations of its headquarters. By the end of February, the odds slipped to about 63%. The futures market has about 60 bp of easing discounted for this year, up from 53 bp at the end of January. The March 17-18 FOMC meeting will see updated projections. In December, the median dot, which hid a wide dispersion of view, anticipated one cut this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Euro:</strong> After it appreciated more than 4.5 cents in the second half of January, the euro pulled back and consolidated for most of February. A base appears to have been forged in the $1.1745-65 area. It looks poised to move higher in March after violating the month-long downtrend line. Initial potential may extend back to the $1.1900-50 area in the coming weeks. Eurozone growth looks stable, even if not inspiring. Infrastructure and defense spending will contribute. The ECB meets on March 19. There is practically no doubt that policy is on hold. The new economic projections are likely to be little changed with the central bank anticipating inflation will hold below the 2% target this year and next. Speculation surfaced that the ECB President Lagarde may step down before her term ends (October 27). She seems to have denied this but, in any case, it is not imminent. Two German states hold elections in March. Baden-Wurttemberg's contest will be held on March 6. The Greens won in 2021 and formed a coalition with the CDU. The CDU is running a little ahead in the polls, and CDU-Green coalition looks to be the most likely outcome. Rhineland-Palatinate holds its election on March 22. The polls suggest a CDU-SPD coalition may replace the current SPD-Greens-FDP tie-up. Denmark has called for a snap election on March 24, ostensibly to secure a stronger mandate to resist US pressure on Greenland.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(As of February 27, indicative closing prices, previous in parentheses)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot:</strong> $1.1812 ($1.1850) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> $1.1900 ($1.1827) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> $1.1832 ($1.1867) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 5.9% (7.3%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Japanese Yen:</strong> The yen looks vulnerable. The two new nominations to the central bank board confirm the market's understanding that Prime Minister Takaichi wants an accommodative monetary policy in the face of the fiscal stimulus. At the same time, the BOJ's reluctance to tighten more aggressively pre-dates the ascendance of Takaichi. Core CPI peaked last May at 3.7%. In January, the latest print was at 2.0%, matching the slowest pace since March 2022. The economy practically ground to a halt last year. Q4 25 growth year-over-year was a meager 0.1%. Growth appears to be off to a stronger start this year. Still, the swaps markets see practically no chance of a hike at the March 19 BOJ meeting. A hike at the start of the new fiscal year in April seems reasonable. However, the risk of intervention has slackened, and the market appears eager to test official resolve. A return to the JPY158-JPY159 area in the coming weeks looks reasonable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot:</strong> JPY156.05 (JPY154.80) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> JPY154.00 (JPY154.40) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> JPY155.65 (JPY154.40). <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 9.2% (9.9%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>British Pound:</strong> Sterling was the weakest of the G10 currencies in February. It fell by about 1.7% against the dollar and 1.3% against the euro. The generally poor string of economic data, outside of retail sales, saw the pendulum of market sentiment swing toward a cut as soon as the March 19 Bank of England meeting. In the swaps market, the odds of a cut rose to nearly 80% from less than 20% at the end of January. The market has another cut fully discounted in H2, which would bring the base rate to 3.25%. The selling pressure on sterling does not appear exhausted. We suspect there is potential toward $1.3250-$1.3300 in the coming weeks. A rare piece of favorable news for the Gilt market may come after Chancellor Reeves' spring statement in early March. The Debt Management Office may announce a GBP59 bln (20%) decline in gross Gilt sales during the new fiscal year. Near GBP245 bln, it would be the least gross sales in three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot:</strong> $1.3482 ($1.3865)<strong> Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> $1.3600 ($1.3600) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> $1.3480 ($1.3585) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 7.2% (7.3%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Canadian Dollar:</strong> For the first time in four months, the Canadian dollar fell against the US dollar in February. The losses were minor (~0.35%). Its prospects look better in March. The US dollar stalled in the CAD1.3700-CAD1.3725 area last month. We suspect there is potential back toward the lower end of the recent range (CAD1.3480-CAD1.3500). While the economy has yet to find an even keel, the 0.6% annualized contraction in Q4 25 overstates the weakness. Inventories were drawn down aggressively and slashed 4.2 percentage points off the headline pace. The trade balance improved and the domestic private sector expanded. Despite weakness in house prices, household spending rose 1.7% (after falling 0.8% in Q3) at an annual pace. With price pressures still firm, the Bank of Canada is still very much on the sidelines. The USMCA continues to offer protection for Canada, but the USMCA review starting around midyear poses risks. At the same time, Canada is gradually diversifying its export markets away from the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot:</strong> CAD1.3650 (CAD 1.3620) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> CAD1.3700 (CAD1.3800) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> CAD1.3630 (CAD1.3585) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 4.9% (6.1%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Australian Dollar:</strong> Profit-taking after the Reserve Bank of Australia hiked its cash rate target on February 3 saw the Australian dollar test our downside objective of $0.6900. It did not stay there long. Within a little more than a week, it reached nearly $0.7150, a three-year high. The firm inflation readings and strength in the labor market suggest hawkish guidance at the March 17 central bank meeting, paving the ground for a hike at the following meeting in early May. Monetary policy divergence and Australia's commodity exposure, including critical materials, underpin the Australian dollar's attractiveness. The Australian dollar's nearly 2.1% gain in February led the G10 currency complex and brought the year-to-date gain to 6.5%. We initially thought potential toward $0.7200 this year seemed reasonable. Though more bullish than the consensus forecast, it is likely to prove too conservative. It may overshoot it in the coming weeks, but we are hesitant to recommend chasing as much good news appears already discounted. A 1-2 cent pullback may provide a better opportunity for those that can afford to be patient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot:</strong> $0.7118 ($0.6695) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> $0.7000 ($0.6700) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> $0.7120 ($0.6970)<strong> One-month implied vol: 9.3%</strong> (10.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mexican Peso: </strong> Last month, the dollar fell to a new low against the peso since June 2024, near MXN17.0865, but only after first slightly overshooting our upside corrective target (MXN17.50-55). The main forces that have lifted the peso by more than 4.5% in January-February remain intact. The yield pickup and relatively modest volatility, with 24-hour activity, it is attractive for dollar-based investors. Still, we recognize a regional theme, as five of the top eight performing emerging market currencies this year are from Latam. High rate and commodity exposure are a shared feature. While the dramatic shift in US policy was disruptive for Mexico, its exports to the US rose in 2025 and it remained the largest US trading partner for the third consecutive year. We suspect the market may be reluctant to take the dollar below the psychologically important MXN17.00 level while US President Trump continues to threaten to leave the USMCA. Mexico's central bank meets on March 26, and the extended pause is set to continue until at least closer to midyear. On the other hand, Brazil's central bank has signaled it will deliver its first rate cut at the March 18 meeting. The Selic rate is currently at 15%. Colombia's central bank meets at the end of March and is expected to hike 25 bp (to 10.50%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot:</strong> MXN17.2270 (MXN17.4605) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> MXN17.60 (MXN17.8685) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> MXN17.2765 (MXN17.5040) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 9.2% (9.5%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Chinese Yuan:</strong> Since the end of 2024, Beijing has allowed the yuan to gradually strengthen against the US dollar. Last year, the yuan appreciated in nine of the 12 months. It appreciated further in January and February this year to extend the streak to nine consecutive months of gains. It appreciated by almost 2% against the US dollar. It has appreciated by another 1.2% this year. The pace is too slow for Chinese critics, but the direction is clear. A stronger exchange rate achieves at least three policy objectives. First, on the margins, it may deflect some criticism over its huge trade surplus. Second, an appreciating currency is conducive to a foreign direct investment expansion strategy that is increasingly adopted by Chinese companies. Third, allowing the yuan to appreciate may also foster its greater use as an international currency. That said, the exchange rate target by Chinese officials is not known, and market participants need to stay vigilant, watching for cues. The PBOC announced two measures at the end of February that may steady the yuan in the short term, though we suspect it will continue to allow a gradual appreciation of the yuan. The central bank cut the required reserves for foreign exchange forwards, which makes them more attractive. It also boosted Chinese banks’ ability to provide yuan liquidity offshore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Spot: </strong>CNY6.8620 (CNY6.9570) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> CNY6.9250 (CNY6.9535) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> CNY6.8830 (CNY6.9625) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 3.4% (4.7%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.marctomarket.com/2026/02/march-2026-monthly.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

I have taken panic calls during Christmas holidays due to an integration failure caused by accident. I sat in meetings where executives grilled me with \"What if it doesn't work\" questions. I have seen projects delayed as customers could not complete the testing process in time. I understand the gravity of building and maintaining a reliable enterprise system—a reality many market participants currently take for granted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, Workday and other software leaders have been severely punished as the <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/video/workday-q4-earnings-why-software-183310253.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Software is being disrupted by AI\"</a> rhetoric took hold. In this hyper-emotional environment, the market seizes upon any flaw to punish the stock. However, I believe this sell-off is unwarranted. The market is underestimating the complexity, sophistication, and \"trust moat\" of the Workday ecosystem. I am assigning a \"buy\" rating to Workday, as the market is currently pricing in a structural decline that my professional experience strongly contradicts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Misunderstanding of the Enterprise SaaS Industry</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you ask any professional who works in the industry, you will certainly receive an answer that Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is an incredibly difficult business. It is not a college midterm where an 85% is an \"A\"; it is a statement of legal and financial liability that demands 100% accuracy and strict regulatory compliance. Workday is the System of Record—the ultimate \"truth\" of an organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"http://siliconangle.com/2026/02/24/workdays-stock-slumps-weak-guidance-ai-disruption-fears/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Critics claim</a> AI agents may soon code curated software systems to disrupt or replace traditional SaaS players, including Workday. This might work for a seven-employee car shop, but not for the mid-to-large enterprises Workday targets. These organizations are deeply risk-averse. A failed enterprise system is catastrophic; no executive will hand the responsibility of payroll and financial integrity to a \"smart but erratic\" AI agent. Using Workday provides a \"Peace of Mind\" insurance that an unverified AI cannot offer. As a result, I do not believe large clients would develop their own native agents to handle massive amounts of data, meeting tremendous reporting and regulatory requirements while accepting the risk of a system failure. This is equivalent to handing the fate of their careers to a casino.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Think about it: even before AI, why didn’t clients build their own internal software? Because they don't just pay Workday for code; they pay for integrity, reputation, and indemnity. Even if I, as an experienced Workday professional, could build a technically functional ERP in weeks, I would never replace Workday because I lack decades of built-up trust and reliability. This \"soft power\" is a moat that AI agents cannot easily cross. That is why many reputable AI companies, including the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/workday-ceo-says-anthropic-and-openai-use-his-company-s-software\" rel=\"nofollow\">developers of Claude</a>, also use Workday to process their sensitive data, despite having the ability to build their own enterprise software.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Market is Pricing in for the Worst</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Workday's Strength in AI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the most recent earnings call, I noticed several key highlights:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In FY26, Workday executed more than 1.7 billion AI actions.</li> <li>In Q4, Workday \"generated over $100 million in new ACV from emerging AI products\", double from Q4 of last year.</li> <li>Over 400 customers have adopted Workday's role-based agents.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I still remember the first time I implemented Workday AI features as a junior resource on a project several years ago. I led a mini project to use AI to scan red flags on expense reports. Now, Workday's AI capabilities have grown exponentially, and clients are excited about new features. My observations in the field support the claims from the management - that Workday's AI offerings are gaining momentum. As an incumbent sitting on an ocean of proprietary data, Workday is uniquely positioned to thrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am particularly excited about Workday Sana. According to the comment from its management:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Sana Core brings conversational AI directly into Workday, so employees can get answers and complete tasks using Workday agents. Sana Enterprise extends the same experience beyond Workday by connecting enterprise tools, like Outlook and Google Drive and so many more, so employees can find information, create agents and automate workflows all in one place. That will create an entirely new way for our 75 million users to engage with Workday.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I were a Workday customer, I would welcome a curated ERP system that promotes automation, streamlines business processes, and keeps the core infrastructure largely intact from large changes. In the world of ERP, \"lift and shift\" should be strictly avoided unless it is absolutely necessary. If I can conveniently enjoy all the reliable outcomes of AI while relying on a trusted infrastructure as my source of truth, why would I seek drastic replacements?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As stated above, I firmly believe that incumbents with excellent vision and execution skills will survive and thrive in the era of AI; those without a clear vision will become obsolete. Not all SaaS companies will survive, but I believe that Workday is well positioned to take on this challenge.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Irrationality</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having gone through ups and downs in the past, I believe that the market is so irrational that it assumes negative narratives about any incumbent software company. The presumption of guilt is what is behind the large catastrophe of software stocks, including Workday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-17721554090133226_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2600\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-17721554090133226_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Workday's Price vs FCF Margin\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-17721554090133226_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-17721554090133226_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-17721554090133226_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-17721554090133226_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Workday's Price vs FCF Margin <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At ~$130 per share today, Workday is trading at:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>13x Forward Non-GAAP P/E: A historical low for the company.</li> <li>0.5 non-GAAP PEG: It is rare to see a growing technology company with 95%+ retention rates trading at 0.5 PEG.

Considering that Workday continues to demonstrate strong cash flow growth, moderated but still robust revenue growth, and a strong FCF margin, it warrants a premium to the S&amp;P 500. If Workday is able to solidify its status as the AI-era ERP leader over the next several quarters, Workday should command a higher valuation premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, considering that most valuation multiples have contracted to historical lows, Workday is trading like a commodity stock with no growth prospects. There has been no material damage to any future earnings and cash flows of Workday, so its price action is largely attributable to the market sentiment. The market is correct to price in the risk of AI disruption, which warrants a contraction from historical norms, as new risks elevate the cost of debt and equity, resulting in a larger discount applied to its terminal value. However, the indiscriminate punishment across the sector has gone too far.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SBC Concerns</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While many argue that its massive stock-based-compensation (SBC) presents a problem (GAAP P/E stands at 40x), I believe that we should compare apples to apples. SBC is not a new problem. It has been a well-known fact since Workday's inception and has been factored into Workday's valuation throughout its history. It's not as if the market suddenly began to care about SBC this morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-1772095294294609_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-1772095294294609_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SBC impact in the past several years.\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-1772095294294609_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-1772095294294609_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-1772095294294609_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53707181-1772095294294609_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SBC in the past several years has stabilized. <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, the company has a buyback program that aggressively offsets its SBC. Last year, Workday repurchased 12.8 million shares, resulting in a net reduction of 1.5 million shares outstanding in the past year. Workday currently guides to 3.18 billion in free cash flow for FY27 - a 15% increase. I believe Workday will meet its guidance and provide new resources for further share buybacks. Should the stock remain suppressed, the company will be able to repurchase shares at a significant discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pessimistic sentiment presents a generational contrarian buy opportunity. Just under a year ago, MU was trading at $65 and NVDA was at $90 when the AI sentiment was low. The current skepticism around SaaS is repeating the same story, though it may take several months for the market to process the reality. Of course, there will be winners and losers, but my bullish stance comes from my professional experience in the ecosystem. I believe that many market participants have never navigated an enterprise system implementation and, as a result, deeply underestimate the stickiness and sophistication of Workday.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, Workday carries significant risks. The competitive landscape in the AI era has effectively produced a new S-curve, and Workday must prove it can execute its AI strategy to meet customer demands.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Headcount Pressure</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market assumes that a significant percentage of the workforce will be reduced due to AI automation. Since Workday's revenue still relies primarily on a per-seat basis, labor market uncertainty may cause per-seat revenue to stagnate. Recently, Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>) just announced a 40% reduction in headcount, citing AI tools as a catalyst; this triggered a new wave of panic in all software stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am personally skeptical of this announcement, as many companies use \"<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2026/02/19/sam-altman-confirms-ai-washing-job-displacement-layoffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI washing</a>\" to justify staff reductions, blaming layoffs on AI when they actually result from other business factors. However, in the long term, AI will eventually replace many jobs - especially entry-level roles. It is a part of an evolution that no one can avoid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I believe the concern is valid, Workday is actively adopting a new pricing model that charges clients based on usage instead of headcount. While total headcount may stagnate, the volume of transactions will not. Transactions will continue at scale generated by AI agents rather than human employees. AI will still require a source of truth and a reliable infrastructure to operate; Workday provides that \"playground\" for human-AI collaboration. While revenue growth may slow during this transition, I expect usage-based-revenue to normalize growth in the long run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not the first time Workday has leveraged new products to revitalize its narrative. Workday Finance, Prism Analytics, Accounting Center, and Adaptive were all introduced to drive revenue as the traditional HCM and payroll markets matured. The ability to integrate new revenue streams in a dynamic environment is a critical skill that maximizes Workday's chance of success.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Execution Risk</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ironically, while the market views Workday as vulnerable to AI disruption, the key risk could be the opposite - what if AI is overrated?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If so, Workday may have invested billions into a product trend that offers more risk than reward. While many software companies embrace AI as a \"politically correct\" necessity, there is a risk that Workday is trying to change a business model that shouldn't be overly generous to AI to begin with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, while I appreciate the boldness of Workday Sana, its potential damage is significant. In my experience, customers struggle more with \"what to do\" than \"how to do it\". As AI interacts with infrastructure to automate processes, a \"wrong order\" could result in \"automated chaos\" - incorrect tasks performed on a massive scale. Negative user experiences could cause risk-averse clients to retreat, damaging Workday's revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I previously mentioned, ERP is a conservative business. This protects Workday’s core infrastructure but may also diminish the return on AI investments. AI add-ons take time to build momentum, but a few bad incidents are enough to spook large customers. Therefore, the quality of execution is key. If Workday fails to deliver high-quality AI, two outcomes are possible:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Systematic Poor Returns: The ERP ecosystem may not be an ideal place for large-scale AI. If the market realizes this, Workday and its competitors will face margin compression and a poor return on AI spend.</li> <li>Competitive Displacement: If AI <em>is</em> a gift to ERP, but Workday’s offerings are less competitive than peers', the company will lose market share and face margin pressure.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As AI-embedded ERP products are in their infancy, it is difficult to predict which risk will prevail. Therefore, diversification is recommended. Investors seeking exposure to the ERP industry should diversify across several large players to minimize specific execution risks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At today's price, I believe that the market has priced in maximum pessimism. While short-term volatility is expected, long-term value will prevail as the narrative shifts over the next several quarters. Instead of panicking over the slight guidance miss, we should emphasize Workday's unique position and moat in the enterprise infrastructure space. I believe now is the time to accumulate quality software stocks, including Workday. If everyone was chasing it at $280, why wouldn't you want it at $130?</p>",

The reason I am not right now is because REITs are bad investments or bad choices; it's because a significant shift in USD/SEK FX made me leave most of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> those investments (that were at a profit) behind. Now that FX has normalized, I'm looking at what REITs to go into, and I've been investing in a couple of them again. Today, I look at Welltower (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WELL\" title=\"Welltower Inc.\">WELL</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and I'll show you why, in this case, I </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">have not</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> invested in this particular one.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I pick investments or even companies to cover, I focus on a couple of things. Fundamentals, profitability, and valuation are core among the qualities that I weigh heavily. I try not to rely <em>too heavily</em> on a company having to \"outperform\" the market or its own expectations. When a company's performance is, in fact, dependent on a specific, expected outperformance, I tend to be very dubious about investing in it. It's because even if we have solid accuracy ratios and forecasts (historically speaking), there's always a certain risk in investing in companies like this. To me, that risk is higher than investing in a company that is fundamentally undervalued for what it is at its heart, irrespective of future outperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To put it another way, I'd rather invest in a cheap-quality company that grows very slowly, or even sometimes not at all, than I would in a company that trades at expensive multiples, and that's because investment return success (mine, in turn) is predicated on outperforming significantly, or even at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the more \"tilted\" you are towards this tendency, the more of a value-oriented investor you can be argued to be. In this article, I'll be updating on Welltower following the company's recent bout of share price appreciation, following in turn the short decline we saw in November-December of 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Welltower - The Upside Here is Tricky</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Welltower is an A-rated healthcare REIT with an AFFO multiple of over 44x. During bad times, such as the GFC or even COVID-19, this company dropped to less than 13x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772266672184131_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"1308\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772266672184131_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T Graphs Welltower REIT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"493\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772266672184131_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772266672184131_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772266672184131_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772266672184131_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Welltower REIT (FAST Graphs)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I feel that this is a very good way to start out this article and updated coverage - to clarify that Welltower is currently at a multiple that it has never been at before (20+ years), and that is close to 3-4x the company's low end and more than 2x the typical average. Its closest peers in the industry trade at less than half the current P/AFFO and have better dividend yields, if not necessarily the same stellar credit rating as Welltower has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First off, let's clarify why the company has risen to these multiple levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has to do with the company's shift to a premium-to-pay model, coupled with a large portion of elderly individuals (the so-called \"Silver Tsunami\") driving demand for senior housing. But not just any senior housing - Welltower is focusing on that luxury senior housing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the pandemic and the decline of many of these healthcare REITs (you can go back to some articles and companies from back then to see what happened to companies like Omega (OHI)), there's been a very sharp decline in construction of new capacity in senior housing - correlated with the current state of US housing, by the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But of course, these demographic tailwinds and advantages alone could never explain why a SHOP REIT like Welltower (previously) is trading at these significant multiples. There's more to it than that. Wall Street, despite the company's rather \"nutty\" valuation multiple relative to historical levels, after all, still has the company at a \"BUY\". So what gives?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, a definite core part of it is also <em>that the company shifted its business model. </em>Typical SHOP/Healthcare/Senior operators <em>are passive landowners</em>. They lease out the land/assets to others who do the operating for them and pay a lease. However, for some time now, the company has moved to an active model of owner-operation. The company's Senior Housing Operating (or SHOP) is part of this, delivering consistent, superior relative returns to the market. The company enhances this with its own data analytics to identify performers and underperformers, allowing them to strategically target and rectify margin issues before they even become a problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its superior credit quality and debt metrics have allowed the company, relative to the BBB- (that's minus) rated companies in the sector, to buy up cheap properties <em>in a market where supply is scarce. </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, as of current demographic trends, these growth metrics or trends are not expected to slow down but to pick up further. The strategic shift to this \"luxury housing\" is certainly the core of what is driving Welltower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772267499068991_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2129\" data-height=\"1153\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772267499068991_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Welltower IR 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772267499068991_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772267499068991_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772267499068991_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-1772267499068991_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Welltower IR 2026</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent trends, reported about 2 weeks ago, confirm the continued growth with the 13th consecutive quarter of 20% NOI growth. Welltower, due to the assets it owns, has some significant pricing power at this time - and in recent results, operating margins have exceeded 30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is not only buying things, but it's also selling them. Its recent plan includes the disposition of its outpatient medical portfolio at $6.4B, which will obviously free up a considerable amount of capital for potential reinvestment into new properties and assets. Money is being used, as of late, to buy up all UK-located senior properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's hold there for a moment. The company is selling all of its outpatient medical, or OM, portfolio for capital recycling. The rationale for this move is obviously to buy other things for that money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I think this is a poor move. Why?</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because Welltower is selling \"crown jewels\" at what could be too-cheap (forward) prices in order to get deeper into SHOP. Welltower has spent many years becoming a solid OM operator. The sold portfolio had a more than 93% occupancy with very, very solid cash flows and much life left in it. I further like outpatient medical sectors because <em>they act as a hedge against a downturn. </em>Their sale represents Welltower giving up valuable diversification and income. It represents, as I see things, Welltower moving from a defensive income play into a very forward-looking, risk-taking growth player. Do we want that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, that would depend on the price, wouldn't it? I certainly wouldn't want to put my money in an overvalued player who wanted to overpay for SHOP assets with the explanation of \"demographics\" while, in my view, ignoring some of the downside risk and the qualities of the very assets that it's selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that I said \"overvalued\" in the paragraph above. Let's presume for a moment that Welltower traded at, let's say, <em>half of its current valuation. </em>Then it would be a different ballgame - I would probably be interested, or at least willing to consider investing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But right now, no matter how solid and how good the results, margins, cash flows, and other metrics are, it doesn't matter to me due to how much I have to pay to \"get\" those margins or returns. It's always about \"what you pay for what you get\". When there's a surge like this in a company, it's always extremely hard to see even the risk or potential for a turnaround of the company dropping once again. It has to do with complex trends - such as the risks of initial issues and risks being hidden by the \"waves\" of success that the company is going through - this has to do with cognitive bias on our part as investors. Confirmation bias is a \"big thing\" here. Too often I've heard investors or clients say, \"Well, the company is still doing well\". It might be, but that doesn't mean in a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The higher a company flies, the less it will take to start to make it tremble, metaphorically speaking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You want an example of this? Look at many people's darling, NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>). Despite what even Nvidia bears like me would describe as a record-breaking quarter in every single metric, the company fell 5% on the trading day. This is proof to me that not only are many of these companies flying so high we can start talking about \"Icarus flying too close to the sun\", but we should also be talking about exits and risks for many more companies than just Nvidia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is one of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Welltower had a superb previous result period, but to me, valuation is what matters. The valuation for the company is as follows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation for Welltower - Not Justifiable Going Into 2026E</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's start with the bull case. The company would, according to bull expectations, sustain its current expansion trajectory, margin growth, and earnings growth. They would have to \"compound\" the successes of 2025 into 2026 and work from there. I would argue that to make the bullish thesis work, the company must maintain double-digit NOI growth, and revenue must keep outperforming expenses. The company must also, in an attractive manner, execute on its pipeline and capital strategy. Growing at 44-45x P/AFFO would continue to drive a somewhat market-beating rate of return here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-17722685651757474_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1661\" data-height=\"1338\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-17722685651757474_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T Graphs Welltower Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"516\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-17722685651757474_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-17722685651757474_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-17722685651757474_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49836612-17722685651757474_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Welltower Upside (FAST Graphs)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's not that I believe that the company will fail with all of these things; it's that I think that the <em>risks aren't being properly considered.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What risks?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Think of it like a \"weight\" on the company. We've already seen the first significant tremble of the company under pressure - that was during November/December when the stock fell, only to now recover at earnings. Based on this, I say that if the company can keep the recent results trends up, I think it might outperform (even at just 15.11%, about 0.11% above my requirement).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For risks, we have a few.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned above, the company is leaving OM behind. Why? There's, to my mind, no good reason for this move (aside from capital recycling - but the company could have tapped equity or debt, easily, to handle this capital need.) The OM segment is growing. There's a structural shift from hospital to outpatient, <em>driven by exactly the same demographic trends the company is citing. </em>The need for OM will be higher, not lower. Yet WELL is, in my view, leaving \"safe money\" on the table here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's new operating profile lacks diversification. Senior housing operations are further correlated to significant volatility due to the reliance on labor, occupancy dips, and other factors, unlike OM, which is much easier to continually fill and work with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, by leaving the sector entirely, WELL is disregarding a multi-decade expertise that they've built up in OM. Over 150 people are leaving the company, people that the company trained and worked with. That's losing skill/expertise, and that's not positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I argue that Welltower should view <em>the healthcare sector for seniors like an ecosystem. </em>In doing what the company is doing, Welltower <em>is giving up a core part of that ecosystem willingly</em> and without really needing to do so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then there are fiscal considerations. The company is getting money for its OM portfolio and cycling it into what are now <em>expensive assets</em>. I believe there's a real risk that Welltower is selling solid-performance assets at what will be discounts to future cash flows while overpaying for assets that will be more volatile than the company expects them to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this, I view the company as being unfavorably valued here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My outlook is bearish. I give the company a premium to long-term AFFO at 25x, but that's as high as I can go for the FV. That comes to $180/share, with a PT of $155/share or lower. This target <em>includes the assumption of future growth</em>, just not as much growth as the market seems to be expecting. My share price targets include a significant correction from these overvalued tendencies over the coming 2-3. I believe we'll see a risk from rising costs relative to revenue growth, as well as the slow introduction of interest rate pressure. I believe that <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/uks-largest-retirement-home-builder-commits-to-40-new-mmc-developments-74143#:~:text=UK's%20largest%20retirement%20home%20builder%20commits%20to%2040%20new%20MMC%20developments,-Home03.02.22&amp;text=The%20UK's%20largest%20retirement%20housing,in%20the%20next%20two%20years.&amp;text=McCarthy%20Stone%2C%20which%20operates%20475,retirement%20communities%20using%20this%20method.\" rel=\"nofollow\">senior housing supply will, in fact, grow now that the supply situation is clear.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once this supply and similar trends become clearer, this premium will, I believe, deflate. I believe this will result in missed growth metrics going forward and a lower AFFO on a per-share basis than expected. This also represents a failure for the company to deliver on its capital acquisitions because they're made at \"too high\" prices. If you want to adjust my targets, the variables are there for you to remove or edit. The shift in any of them towards the positive side would result in a higher FV/PT, ultimately towards the end the $240-$350/share target that some analysts have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not one of them, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My thesis for Welltower for 2026 is as follows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Welltower is a very solid REIT, with what some might argue are best-in-class fundamentals with significant upside. However, the company's strategy does not convince me that the upside for 2026-2028E will be as high as it is expected, and I believe the company's plan to succeed is flawed in terms of risk/reward at this particular valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view the move from the solid OM segment as the wrong move as a justification for the capital recycling strategy. What I would have liked to see is a hybrid approach or an entirely equity/debt approach to fund this move - perhaps with more care and consideration as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the risks are now higher than before and, coupled with the valuation, are unsustainably high. For that reason, I update with an FV of $180/share and a PT of $155/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (<em>in italics</em>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</em></li> <li><em>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</em></li> <li>This company is currently cheap.</li> <li>This company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators and 0 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 3/5 \"stars\" here, which typically isn't enough. Based on this and a valuation target of $155/share, I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a \"Hold\" rating as of February 2026.</p>",

But Permian Resources (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PR\" title=\"Permian Resources Corporation\">PR</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) is a much smaller company located in the Permian. Therefore, this company has long elected to pursue growth by purchasing small parcels and combining them with the leases it already has to create value for shareholders. This type of growth is likely to be able to be executed for a very long time. It seems like there are always small positions that are hard to market available for purchase. Additionally, the costs of this strategy are often far less than the traditional acquisition strategy.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-1772234506910857_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Permian Resources Fourth Quarter Acquisition Strategy Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-1772234506910857_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-1772234506910857_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-1772234506910857_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-1772234506910857_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Permian Resources Fourth Quarter Acquisition Strategy Summary <span>(Permian Resources Corporate Presentation Fourth Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://permianres.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PR-Q425-Earnings-Presentation.vFF_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">average purchase price</a> shown above is dirt cheap compared to a lot of acquisitions that cost up to $65,000 an acre. This affects the location cost of a well. For investors, enough of these purchases will show as above-average company profitability because it does not require as much capital per well location as the far more traditional acquisition strategy does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should also be noted that the location cost shown above has two significant variables. Those variables are acreage cost and the choice of well spacing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722348452095027_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Permian Resources Overall 2025 Acquisition Program Accomplishments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722348452095027_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722348452095027_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722348452095027_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722348452095027_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Permian Resources Overall 2025 Acquisition Program Accomplishments <span>(Permian Resources Corporate Presentation Fourth Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ability to do this likely makes the company a bit pickier about large acquisitions. After all, 30,000 net acres (roughly) is significant for many companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many times, acquisitions like this are accretive because the combined acreage offers more profit potential than do two separate holdings. This consideration is completely different from the benefits of the low prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, there are several ways to win with a rollup strategy. But very few managements of the companies that I follow bother with such a strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most managements prefer an acquisition that \"moves the needle\". But this strategy, over time, can prove to be a very significant profit enhancement idea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, such a program is a sign of detail-oriented management that is very important to the commodity business. Any time a company can be extra profitable compared to the competition, that \"extra profitable\" becomes a competitive advantage that can last a while. Sometimes a strategy like this is very similar to a competitive moat as long as it continues to be well executed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last Article</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last article noted the disciplined nature of the acquisition strategy here. This company is not as dependent upon large acquisitions to grow, even though it has made large acquisitions in the past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More than a few companies have announced intentions to grow by exploring new intervals. Much of the Permian is a stacked play with multiple intervals. There are plenty of those intervals that are either still to be developed or are older plays revolutionized by ongoing technology improvements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Probably a big difference here is that this company has so far not joined the \"mad rush\" to the Midland Basin. This is where many companies have chosen to grow their business in recent years. Instead, the focus here remains on the Delaware Basin (at least for the time being).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554612-permian-resources-shareholder-alignment\">Keep in mind</a> that Permian Resources has only really been around since fiscal year 2023. The management that is running the company had a lot of success building and selling private companies before this attempt. This is the first attempt at building and probably selling a public company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes the acquisition strategy a key part of putting the company together for an eventual sale. However, the market often demands a period of time necessary to form a few years of a track record of the company as it is currently composed. Therefore, shareholders may well expect better valuation of this company ahead as acquisitions play a progressively smaller part of the company's growth in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is beginning to get consideration for an investment-grade debt rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722359643966365_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Permian Resources Debt Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722359643966365_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722359643966365_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722359643966365_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1102834-17722359643966365_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Permian Resources Debt Summary <span>(Permian Resources Corporate Presentation Fourth Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the reasons for the low debt ratio is the ongoing program to purchase small lease holdings at a big discount to the market. That often makes the production that follows on this acreage more profitable due to the lower location costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other thing is that this is that rare company with a prime Permian location in the Delaware Basin. Very few companies accomplish a locational advantage like this. Fewer still manage to grow in an area that is a focus for much of the industry. Most companies this size and smaller are outbid for acreage in an area like this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But now, with one ratings agency basically giving this company an investment-grade rating and another one (S&amp;P) getting very close to the same conclusion, it would appear there will be an interest rate advantage to that low debt as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Probably the big deal is the increase in the base dividend. This company will repurchase stock with some more money so that if there is something that needs to stop (due to weak commodity prices), the first thing that stops is the stock buyback program. That makes the dividend far more defensible than one would normally think for an upstream company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1102834-17722607027515593_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Permian Resources Summary Of Fiscal Year 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1102834-17722607027515593_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1102834-17722607027515593_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1102834-17722607027515593_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1102834-17722607027515593_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Permian Resources Summary Of Fiscal Year 2025 <span>(Permian Resources Corporate Presentation Fourth Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company has a darn good cost structure for a company of this size. Part of this is due to the geology where the company is located. Of course, then it is up to management to make the best of the situation. I have covered companies in this area that settled for \"good enough\" because the geology was that good. This does not appear to be one of those companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management states that the dividend is covered down to roughly WTI $40. That is far better than many competitors that have replied to the<a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2501\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Dallas Federal Reserve Energy Survey</a> that they need WTI in the upper $60 range to drill new wells (let alone pay a dividend).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, it looks like Permian Resources is beginning to slowly cross a ratings border towards investment grade. This company is a good deal smaller than many of the companies I follow that make investment grade. If it happens that all the ratings companies eventually consider this investment grade, it is a tribute to management that it happened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, this company is continuing its growth story by acquiring \"bolt-on\" small, suboptimal parcels. These parcels border on leases that the company already has. The combination of the two holdings is often more profitable than was the case when they were separate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This management has built and sold companies before. For me, this remains a strong buy idea that I would hold until management sells the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is always a risk that the growth story changes or fails to provide the positive results seen in the past. Should something like that happen, I would probably re-evaluate the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A severe and sustained commodity price decline could materially change the company outlook. Now it would appear that this company has breakeven costs that allow a very low WTI price to support the dividend. Therefore, a lot of companies would suffer far more than this one in any cyclical downturn.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Any management that builds and sells companies is a subset of the managers qualified for the various jobs in this company. A replacement of a key manager could prove to be quite a challenge because very few senior managers can build and sell companies. Therefore, the loss of services could set back the company or materially change the company's future.</p>",

Management’s outlook for its data center business was extremely high-caliber, projecting a 3.5x increase in data center revenues, leading me to adopt a bullish view on AOI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there is enough precedent to show investors must mix elements of caution in their bullishness on AOI as highlighted in the risk section.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand For Laser Products In Datacenters Is Too High</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AOI competes directly with Lumentum (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LITE\" title=\"Lumentum Holdings Inc.\">LITE</a>) and Coherent (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COHR\" title=\"Coherent Corp.\">COHR</a>) but is much smaller compared to both its larger peers. I just wrote about the difference between Lumentum and Coherent, which should be somewhat useful for investors in the context of AOI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike Lumentum but similar to Coherent, AOI is a highly vertically integrated company that manages and controls the entire manufacturing &amp; production process of making its optical products, including manufacturing semiconductor laser chip components to assembling the final product(s)—turnkey modules and equipment like optical transceiver modules, which are mostly sold to hyperscalers. Outside of the DC (data center) market, AOI also manufactures 1.8 GHz HFC (Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial) amplifiers that are deployed in CATV (cable TV networks).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, CATV and DC are two major end markets for AOI, and in CY25, CATV was the growth vector for AOI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the recent<a href=\"https://investors.ao-inc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/applied-optoelectronics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-5\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Q4 results</a>, AOI reported a 34% increase in Q4 revenues worth $134.3M, beating expectations by 4.7% or $6M. For the full year, CY25 revenues came in at $455.7M, accounting for 54% of AOI’s CY25 revenue base, implying the CATV revenue segment surged 2.8x over its CY24. DC revenues accounted for 43% and grew 32% over CY24, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852595430174_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1544\" data-height=\"818\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852595430174_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit A: AOI’s revenues per year split by end markets.\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"339\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852595430174_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852595430174_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852595430174_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852595430174_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exhibit A: AOI’s revenues per year split by end markets. <span>(Company filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s really management’s outlook on its DC business that worked its charm on markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management expects to touch a billion dollars in consolidated revenue this year, and its hyperscaler customers are expected to account for 70% of the CY26 $1B revenue projection, which represents an astounding leap of revenues projected in the DC market for AOI. Per my estimates based on management’s projections, DC revenues should be jumping 3.5x to ~$700M in CY26, which is extremely powerful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most of the DC revenues this year came from sales of AOI’s 400G optical transceiver modules, and the momentum in 400G modules is expected to continue in Q1 CY26. But from Q2 onwards AOI’s 800G optical modules will become the majority revenue growth driver, and the ramp is expected to stay robust throughout the year. Also, AOI expects 1.6T optical modules to ramp up later this year, with 1.6T modules becoming the major revenue driver next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is very promising for AOI because as the company ships higher-speed modules (400G to 800G to 1.6T), the opportunity for gross margins significantly increases. That’s exactly what markets want to see. Gross margins in Q4 came in at 31%, and management sees a strong path to 40% margins by the end of next year if they can continue to move customers up to the 1.6T optical modules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management revealed that their lead hyperscaler customer, Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), is already engaging with them to ramp up on 800G optical modules, and one other hyperscaler should join Microsoft as their two largest hyperscaler customers in CY26. AOI is also engaging with two other hyperscaler customers for 800G optical modules, with the fourth potential hyperscaler customer also looking at deploying AOI’s 1.6T optical modules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most encouraging sign here is that management has been deploying its capex with the sole goal of sourcing more raw materials and building more manufacturing &amp; assembly capacity. As seen below, AOI’s capex has been growing at ~4x rates per year since CY23, with CY25 capex standing at $210M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852858112214_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1784\" data-height=\"648\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852858112214_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit B: Comparing AOI’s annual revenue growth and capex growth vs capex % revenue.\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852858112214_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852858112214_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852858112214_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722852858112214_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exhibit B: Comparing AOI’s annual revenue growth and capex growth vs capex % revenue. <span>(Company filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And management believes they’re still capacity constrained. Assuming they deploy more capex and follow a rigorous discipline of shipping their optical modules on time to customers, AOI easily has a path to grow revenues beyond the $1B mark while expanding gross margins beyond the 31% Q4 gross margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that case, AOI’s shares look extremely cheap from a valuation standpoint.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AOI’s Revenue Multiple Signals Explosive Upside</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consensus estimates point to AOI’s revenues growing to $856M, an ~88% growth over CY25 revenues. That’s under the CY26 $1B revenue guide that management gave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if I consider $856M in analyst’s CY26 revenue expectations and factor in AOI’s enterprise value of $5.8B, that gets me to a forward revenue multiple of 6.8x. In my opinion, that still leaves room for AOI’s forward revenue multiple to expand to ~8.5x as it did last year on the hopes of CY25 revenues doubling. This implies ~23-25% upside from current levels for AOI’s shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-1772285365586598_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1992\" data-height=\"1278\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-1772285365586598_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit C: AOI's forward revenue multiple shows potential for strong upside\" width=\"640\" height=\"411\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"411\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-1772285365586598_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-1772285365586598_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-1772285365586598_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-1772285365586598_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exhibit C: AOI's forward revenue multiple shows potential for strong upside <span>(yCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If investors consider management's CY26 $1B revenue expectation, the forward revenue multiple can be estimated to be ~5.8x. Assuming the exit multiple of ~8.5x, this implies an upside of 45% in AOI’s shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the outlook looks very strong. But before turning extremely bullish, investors must consider the risks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks On Staying Permanently Bullish On AOI</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AAOI has some painful history during CY16-CY18, the years when optical networks were ramping from 40G to 100G speeds. You can take it from me, because I learned it the hard way why I should adopt a tactical bullish view on AOI, keeping in mind the risks of investing in AOI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2017, AOI’s shares had surged in advance of a strong outlook announced in Q1 CY17. At the time, management revealed that they had secured large orders from major hyperscalers who were upgrading their networks from 40G speeds to 100G speeds. But execution risks eventually played out that year, and by the end of CY17, shares were crashing because revenues that were expected from the 100G ramp-up were strangely contracting in CY17.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This can also be seen in management’s capex plans, which largely remained contained at ~$21-22M between H2 CY17 and CY18, despite AOI’s revenue accelerating at ~2x pace rates. Management’s unusually tight capex plans at the time eventually led to inherent demand loss, severely impacting revenue growth versus prior guidance ranges. And I believe this created extreme lumpy volatility in AOI’s growth rates as well as customer base at the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722854070508828_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1988\" data-height=\"1386\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722854070508828_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit D: Comparing Applied Optoelectronics’ revenue growth vs capex plans in 2017-2018.\" width=\"640\" height=\"446\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"446\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722854070508828_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722854070508828_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722854070508828_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59636229-17722854070508828_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exhibit D: Comparing Applied Optoelectronics’ revenue growth vs capex plans in 2017-2018. <span>(yCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4149218-applied-optoelectronics-aaoi-ceo-thompson-lin-on-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript\"> AOI’s Q4 CY17 call</a>, management said that the issue in their revenue miss in that year was <em>“customer specific,”</em> in response to an analyst's question around why AOI’s <em>“100 gig revenue was down.”</em> AOI had execution issues in planning and building enough capacity to meet the demand surge. This led to loss of orders, probably even losing Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) entirely as a customer.<a href=\"https://investors.ao-inc.com/static-files/0771159e-3733-47ba-baac-9a2f8051671a\" rel=\"nofollow\"> In CY17</a>, Microsoft, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), and Meta Platforms were AOI’s three major hyperscaler customers, accounting for ~78% of AOI’s revenue in that year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the years, only Microsoft remained as AOI’s long-time hyperscaler customer, with Amazon maintaining a cyclical business relationship with AOI. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms moved over its business entirely to peers like Lumentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per<a href=\"https://investors.ao-inc.com/node/16686/html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> AOI’s CY25 10-K</a>, Microsoft continues to be a major hyperscaler, accounting for ~29% of AOI’s revenues, while Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) has also become a meaningful AOI customer, accounting for ~12% of AOI’s revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With respect to Microsoft’s contract, there is potential for execution risk to occur, which might make AOI lose out on Microsoft’s 800G program. AOI hinted that the firmware in their 800G modules for Microsoft faced glitches causing AOI to optimize firmware. This impacted the overall revenue targets of AOI’s 800G program in Q4, causing 800G sales to come under the $4-8M target range that AOI had initially projected and leading to a situation similar to CY17, where 400G module sales grew faster than the higher-margin 800G module sales. Management has said that they should be completing firmware optimization on these 800G modules for Microsoft next month. But the firefighting management had to do with updating 800G module firmware, meaning management expects very little revenue from 800G shipments in Q1 CY26, while 400G modules will account for most of the transceiver module revenues in this quarter. 800G transceiver modules are expected to ramp in Q2 CY26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me circle back to Amazon as a customer for AOI because it is a point of contention between bulls and bears. Although Amazon has not been a major customer for AOI in CY25, AOI has an active<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1158114/000168316825001580/appliedopto_ex0401.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"> share warrant agreement</a> (issued in October ‘25) in place with Amazon that vests only after Amazon buys $4B worth of AOI’s product over the next 10 years or ~$400M per year worth of forward revenues. AOI’s revenues in CY25 were $456M, so that gives investors some perspective of the scale of the Amazon warrant in case Amazon decides to pursue the share warrant’s revenue goals. There are a few speculative short reports issued early last year stating that AOI botched its manufacturing &amp; delivery timelines with Amazon. But at the same time there are also many speculative bullish reports that use the October share warrant to explain why Amazon may ramp up purchases at AOI. Either way it's best to stay focused on management’s guidance and cross-reference that to its capex and inventory levels. But the whole point of the risks section so far is to illustrate meaningful execution risks similar to CY17-18.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, outside of AOI’s hyperscaler customer segment, AOI has a deep and long relationship with Digicomm International, who acts as a system integrator on behalf of AOI. Digicomm usually integrates AOI’s optical components and products in the cable TV network domain outside the purview of AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In CY25, Digicomm alone accounted for 53% of AOI’s revenues. Add Microsoft’s contribution of 28.8% and Oracle’s contribution of 12.4%, and we arrive at this fresh new perspective on AOI’s CY25 revenue base, where 94% of AOI’s revenues came from just 3 customers. The significant revenue contribution from Digicomm explains why AOI’s CATV revenues jumped 2.8x in CY25. That's a significant concentration risk not only from a very few customers but also from just one customer too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the call, management did provide some very interesting color on how the nature of their customer concentration may be changing in CY26 to account for 70% hyperscalers (DC end market) vs. 30% cable TV (CATV end market):</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p><em>So if you break down the revenue, right, you just take a round number of $1 billion, right? -- subtract the $300-ish that we have in cable TV, that gives you $700 million-ish left over. Right now, I would expect that's going to be dominated by -- most of that is going to be 2 large hyperscale customers.</em></p> <p><em>And they'll probably be roughly equivalent exiting the year. We'll see how that plays out. It's pretty early to say exactly how the timing on that is going to go. But I would expect at least 2 [hyperscalers] to be sort of comparable in size, let's put it that way. And then obviously, the third one that would be smaller in scale, but still significant.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If AOI gets it right this time, the company actually could use customer concentration to its advantage, significantly boosting potential for further upside. But it doesn’t take away the execution risk, which we saw a glimpse of in Q4 based on their module firmware issues creating a volatile situation similar to CY17-18.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">History is not fully on the side of AOI. But, this time around, I do feel encouraged by the ramp-up in capex this time, which does give me some hope that AOI might have capacity in place to meet demand this time around, giving the ‘reward’ a slight edge in AOI’s risk/reward profile, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why I’m sticking to a bullish call on AOI but advising investors to be extra careful with their positions. Investors must invest in AOI according to their risk appetite or use hedging tools accordingly to mitigate risk.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AOI’s outlook for CY26 shows just how much demand there is for laser components, products, and optical transceiver modules, especially from hyperscalers. The risks for AOI to get it wrong are meaningful, but should they get this right, unlike the CY16-CY18 years, AOI could benefit from incredible upside.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am bullish on AOI’s outlook for now.</p>",
