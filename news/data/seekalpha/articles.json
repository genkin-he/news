(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUDC\" title=\"AudioCodes Ltd.\">AUDC</a></span>) in February of 2024, when we doubled down on our cautious stance (Hold rating) in the voice AI software-related Israeli company. Shares at the time looked like they were undergoing<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a bottoming pattern, as demonstrated by a crossover of the popular long-term MACD indicator just a few months previous. AUDC stock, as we see below, topped out in mid-2020, so it was tangible that buyers were finally stepping in, given the improved </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUDC/valuation/metrics\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">valuation</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on offer. Suffice it to say, although requiring more bullish evidence (primarily concerning growth rates, which would be revealed in earnings reports that followed), downside risk seemed limited in AUDC some 21 months ago.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as we see below, AUDC stock failed to gain traction since then, with the stock actually losing approximately 17% in the process. From a technical standpoint, initially, it must be stated that the long-term death cross (crossing of the 10-month moving average beneath its 40-month average) in mid-2022 trumps any other technical indicator, including the long-term MACD. That moving-average death cross confirmed that AUDC entered a long-term bear market at that time. The opposing subsequent bullish MACD crossover can act as a precursor to a turnaround, but it should never be acted on solely, especially against the prevailing trend. Therefore, this is why, from an initial technical standpoint, we stood pat on our cautious stance 21 months ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"1277\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AUDC Long-Term Technicals\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"826\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AUDC Long-Term Technical Chart (<span></span>StockCharts)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Continue to Disappoint</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a fundamental standpoint, AudioCodes' quarterly earnings results have been disappointing, with the company missing EPS expectations in five out of the last six quarters. Although the company's second-quarter revenues ($61.08 million) this year beat the consensus, GAAP earnings were barely profitable ($0.01), missing the estimate by $0.06 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Irrespective of the rise in revenues, both compared to Q2 last year and Q1 this year, operating profit ($2.6 million) and GAAP profit ($0.3 million) both trailed their quarterly counterparts by some margin. This really is the issue with AUDC in that approximately $1 million in tariff-related costs hit the income statement in Q2, with up to $4 million expected to be the full-year tariff-related figure before all is said and done.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs Exacerbating Profitability Headwinds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Suffice it to say, irrespective of AUDC's attractive valuation, it looks like tariff-related costs are only going to exacerbate the company's poor profitability trends and forward-looking growth rates alike, most likely suppressing share-price appreciation in the process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why investors should not solely focus on the likes of AUDC's growing services revenues ($32.6 million in Q2), which will keep growing recurring revenue streams over time. When it boils down to it, AUDC needs much better top-line growth rates because positive fundamentals in certain parts of AUDC's business continue to be drowned out by elevated tariff-related costs and muted growth, all things remaining equal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Internal Growth Engines Not Showing Up in Overall Numbers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, with annual guidance remaining on hold due to ongoing uncertainty, the 6%+ Q2 growth, for example, in the <a href=\"https://www.uctoday.com/ccaas/audiocodes-voca-cic-now-supports-microsoft-teams-phone-extensibility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Teams</a> business, is not enough, you feel, to change sentiment here. Furthermore, how much of the projected 40% growth in CX's <a href=\"https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AUDC/audio-codes-expands-voice-c-paa-s-offering-with-ai-vtqmyalnovkh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conversational AI</a> business next year will end up dropping to the bottom line? Moreover, whilst fresh certification approvals may open up connectivity with other platforms, how are we to gauge these developments when management fails to provide forward-looking annual visibility whilst growing its own controlled costs (SG&amp;A) in the process?</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses rose to $35 million, up from $32.5 million in the year-ago period. The higher expenses are primarily attributable to higher investments in marketing and sales resources as part of our conversational AI investment. As to the guidance, as mentioned in our previous quarter's discussion, we will postpone issuing a financial outlook until we have a better and clearer understanding of the resolution regarding tariff rates.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Expected Earnings Look Like More of the Same</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consensus for the third quarter (expected to be announced 11/4/2025) is expecting $0.01 in GAAP earnings on revenues of $60.8 million (1.2% expected growth). Again, we see here that these growth rates are not strong enough (GAAP earnings of $0.09 per share were reported in Q3 last year) when attempting to shift investor sentiment in earnest.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Discount Model</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, when we have a stock that is technically in a long-term bear market, has profitability headwinds, yet still pays a dividend, we like to run a dividend discount model to try and stamp an accurate valuation on the company. The formula we will use is the following</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-17618235258163922.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Discount Model Formula\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend Discount Model (<span></span>WallStreetMojo)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">where EDPS is 'Expected Dividend Per Share.' CCE denotes 'Cost Of Equity,' and DGR refers to AudioCodes' 'Dividend Growth Rate'.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To initially calculate AudioCodes' DGR, we multiply the company's GAAP retention ratio (21.74%) by its return on equity (7.32%). DGR = 1.59%. Therefore, we can state that our EDPS equals the current annual dividend ($0.40) multiplied by 1.0159 = $0.41 per share</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To calculate AUDC's cost of equity, we use the formula below. Cost of equity is denoted as the rate of return investors require from a long investment in AUDC. We will use the current US 10-year treasury yield as our risk-free rate (4.06%), volatility instrument beta comes in at 0.96, and '<a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equity Risk Premium</a>' (4.33%) (denotes minimum expected return on a long investment in AUDC).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost of equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta) x (Equity Risk Premium)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost of equity = 4.06 + (0.96)(4.33) = 8.22%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, the fact that COE comes in higher than ROE demonstrates that value is not being created for shareholders but actually being destroyed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging all of our numbers into the dividend discount model above, we get</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Value of AUDC = $0.41 / 0.0822 - 0.0159 = $6.18 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, to sum up, based on AUDC's struggling profitability, lack of annual guidance from management, and dividend discount model result, we are downgrading our rating in AUDC to a 'Sell' until further notice. Many times, binary events such as quarterly earnings reports have the potential to change sentiment for the better, but constrained profitability trends point to us that all the risk remains to the downside. We look forward to continued coverage.</p>",

While I really like the company a lot, the current valuation is a bit discouraging. The company has been growing fast and has a lot more room to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> grow, both on the top line and the bottom line. However, the problem is that to justify buying at the current valuation, it would need to grow above 20% CAGR for ten years, and it requires a pretty high net margin of 18% in the tenth year. While I believe the company could hit those numbers, it's a scenario that's tough to pull off.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hesai is a Chinese leader in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lidar </a>(Light Detection and Ranging) technology. To analyze the whole business, we can break down its operations into three main markets. First, in the automotive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">ADAS</a> (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). They supply major global Chinese OEMs, helping them create advanced cruise control and semi-autonomous driving. Second, they're the leading provider of Lidar sensors required for fully automated vehicles (<a href=\"https://www.sae.org/news/blog/sae-levels-driving-automation-clarity-refinements\" rel=\"nofollow\">level 4</a>) used in both robotaxis and roboshuttles. Third, they're developing and supplying robotic and industrial applications, including warehousing, logistics, and mapping.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://investor.hesaitech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hesai-group-reports-second-quarter-2025-unaudited-financial\" rel=\"noopener\">last quarter</a>, the company reported triple-digit Y/Y shipment growth, showing an impressive change over the last year. Plus, it's starting to show profitability, which is another bullish indicator worth highlighting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"862\" data-height=\"213\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"hesai key metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Key metrics <span>(Author's using company's fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/lidar-industry-enters-mass-adoption-phase-hesai-remains-leader-in-global-market-share/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yole Group</a>, Hesai, despite maintaining dominance of the lidar automotive market, has dropped by 5% (500 basis points) between 2023 and 2024. It's important to note two aspects that create a lot of uncertainty regarding Hesai's market share and sales growth. First, the technological factor: any player could come up with a new technology and really threaten the sales and market share of everyone else. Second, given that ADAS and robotaxis are so sensitive, particularly due to the potential for hitting a pedestrian, the regulatory landscape is likely to shift rapidly in any direction. Therefore, we should be cautious when making sales and margin projections, especially when we consider the market share variations between Hesai and Huawei, as shown in the following chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://medias.yolegroup.com/uploads/2025/04/IMG-LIDAR-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-2024-vs-2023-market-share_YG_Apr2025-1024x662.jpg\" alt=\"market share lidar hesai yole\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Yole Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the last few months clearly show a strong rebound. According to Gaishi Auto Research in August 2025, they held a 46% Automotive LiDAR <a href=\"https://www.itiger.com/news/1153102953\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">market share</a>, which is 1.5 times that of the second-ranked competitor and 2.4 times that of the third. The monthly installation volume has almost tripled since January, soaring from 33,485 units to 97,583 units. It's also worth noting that the bar is getting higher in the automotive industry; features once considered luxury are now becoming standard. For example, the Lidar sensors are now being called \"the invisible airbag.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-lidar-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordor Intelligence</a>, the Lidar industry is expected to grow 18.85% until 2030. The main driver is the potential breakthrough of solid-state, less than $500 sensors for mid-tier models instead of premium ones, in other words, the potential acceleration of mass adoption of the LiDAR technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In August, the company reported achieving a \"<a href=\"https://investor.hesaitech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hesai-group-reports-second-quarter-2025-unaudited-financial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">C-sample phase</a>\" for a top European OEM. In short, the \"A phase\" is about quick prototyping; the B phase focuses on functionality and final design. The C phase is about demonstrating the capability for high-volume quality required by the OEM. Then the D phase is the start of production. In other words, sales are going to be spiced up by expanding into Europe. Also, they announced a joint venture with Toyota based in China, with mass production beginning in 2026. In the domestic Chinese market, they led the creation of a \"<a href=\"https://www.codeofchina.com/standard/GBT45500-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">standardization</a>\" of sensors, along with 50 other manufacturers, to accelerate the mass adoption of ADAS and lidar technologies. This has two advantages for Hesai: First, it could accelerate sales (through mass adoption), and second, it creates barriers to entry for small competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The robotics and \"physical AI\" segment can be framed as a call option, where the downside risk is somewhat limited to R&amp;D costs, but the upside has almost no ceiling given the vast range of potential applications ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to valuation, it may be somewhat tricky for two reasons: First, the company is growing revenues fast at 38% TTM Y/Y in USD; and secondly, the margins are improving fast. In both cases, to approach valuation, it requires making assumptions in order to reach a figure and draw our conclusions about whether it is cheap, expensive, or fairly valued. Also, this is not done without a high level of uncertainty about the growth rate and the margin performance ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenues growth assumptions hesai\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"404\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Revenues growth assumptions <span>(Author's)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here, the first three years are projected in line with the analyst consensus estimates. However, even after doing that, the rates are very optimistic. For example, when Mordor Intelligence expects an 18% CAGR in the next 5 years, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSAI/earnings/estimates\">analyst consensus</a> implied rate is 37% CAGR between 2025 and 2030. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">((2230/452)^(1/5))-1 = 37.60%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my case, I decided to go for a more conservative approach, using the native Excel function to forecast. It's still on the upper end of the optimistic forecast, but more realistic. To reach such a figure, I'm assuming the company will be able to do two things. First, it will maintain its current market share (in relative terms), but on a \"bigger market\" (growing in absolute terms), when mid-tier vehicles would adopt Lidar technology in bulk. Second, I assume the company will have some success developing and commercializing new robotic models for industrial applications, outside of the automotive segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following valuation model is based on 4 key variables: revenue growth, net margin at the tenth year, a P/E representative of fair value for this company, and cost of equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I already discussed potential revenue growth. Regarding net margin, it is the most uncertain part of this, especially looking at the 10 years ahead. However, I'm modeling not only to \"project,\" but also to \"<a href=\"https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/reverse-dcf-model/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reverse value</a>\" the company - in other words, how much it needs to reach in net margin terms to justify the current valuation. As we see in the sensitivity analysis, Hesai will have to grow at a CAGR rate of around the 20s, combined with reaching a net margin of at least 18% in the tenth year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1302\" data-height=\"457\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"hesai fair valued cheap expensive\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's assumptions</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the P/E ratio, I just used 17x, which is the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSAI/valuation/metrics\">median</a> sector in SA. There are two sides here. The company may be significantly above the median discretionary sector because of its dominance and high level of innovation, but on the other hand, it is a Chinese company, which has additional risks compared to an American one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the cost of equity, as I discussed in previous articles (especially in other Chinese companies, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815623-qfin-holdings-poor-3q-2025-guidance-weakens-the-bullish-thesis\">such as</a> Qfin (QFIN)), I'm somewhat skeptical about the CAPM model. The Chinese <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/government-bond-yield\" rel=\"nofollow\">10y rate</a> now is at 1.75%; it doesn't make a lot of sense to discount to that rate, which translates into a measure of risk lower than an average US company. Instead, I used the US rate, so it resulted in something slightly above average, which I believe is more representative of Hesai.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are several risks to note, I will discuss the two I consider the most important: competition and political risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to competition, despite their dominance in the market, there are other fierce competitors, such as Robosense (the main Chinese competitor), Luminar Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAZR\" title=\"Luminar Technologies, Inc.\">LAZR</a>), Quanergy Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QNGYQ\" title=\"Quanergy Systems, Inc.\">OTCPK:QNGYQ</a>), and Innoviz Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INVZ\" title=\"Innoviz Technologies Ltd.\">INVZ</a>). We should consider competition from three different perspectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, Hesai's strategy is to lower prices in order to accelerate massive adoption; in that case, they would win not by a high margin but instead by high volume sold. However, the downside of this strategy is the potential price war that could erupt and really compress the company's profit margins. In a price war scenario, the companies with the most volume produced/sold will most likely survive, and the small ones will be hurt the most. So despite being somewhat bad, I believe it is not \"so bad\" for Hesai. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, they have a significant client concentration risk; losing only a few contracts/clients could show a substantial difference in total revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, because we're dealing with a relatively new technology, there is a significant level of uncertainty. A competitor could find a way to develop a superior product—one with better value for money—and really challenge Hesai.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding political risks, there are two to highlight. First, the Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/pentagon-removes-lidar-maker-hesai-us-list-firms-alleged-help-beijings-military-2024-10-16/\" rel=\"noopener\">re-included Hesai</a> on its list of Chinese military companies. After Hesai filed an appeal, a U.S. District Court <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/news/us-court-keeps-chinese-lidar-maker-hesai-on-pentagon-blacklist\" rel=\"nofollow\">upheld</a> the decision of the Pentagon. I believe the company will be fine as long as they avoid colluding with the Chinese military, of course. Given that case, the Pentagon, Europe, and others will be a ceiling in revenues for this company. I don't think Hesai's management has the incentives for doing that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, there was the risk of delisting Chinese stocks by the U.S. government. However, this risk has lowered over time. Regarding these two issues, the company has been primarily listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In other words, the company achieved a <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/hesai-successfully-listed-on-the-main-board-of-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow\">double primary listing</a> condition, and, therefore, its stocks are fungible. This means that, in the event of a US delisting, investors can easily convert their US-listed shares to the fungible shares traded in Hong Kong.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last months, things changed for good for Hesai. First, the delisting risk from the US government (which was somewhat small) has been further lowered by the double-primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Revenue in 2026 is highly likely to be spiced up by the European OEM, along with the joint venture with Toyota in China. Also, the potential in the robotics segment, while it's uncertain, is very appealing to me because the upside could be huge. From an <a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/ansoff-matrix/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ansoff Matrix</a> point of view, this segment was a question mark, but if the trend continues, it appears that it will become the star segment. All this, of course, without taking anything away from the ADAS and robotaxis/roboshuttles segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the risks, competition, the potential price war, and the political issues are somewhat manageable as of now. So, at first glance, it may not jeopardize the company. However, at the end of the day, the key metric for every company is forward earnings. From a reverse valuation point of view, the requirements of revenue growth and margins are pretty high at the current valuation. As for me, I'll wait on the sidelines for this great company; if there is a 20-30% drop in prices and no substantial change in the fundamentals, I will consider buying.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

            "description": "<p><figure class=\"getty-figure\" data-type=\"getty-image\"><picture><img src=\"https://media.gettyimages.com/id/166835123/nl/foto/close-up-of-pacific-islander-womans-eye-with-mechanical-lens.jpg?b=1&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=HcOtDRdvU0vBV1-6CkdPKH3BRxQgA_-_VIDvPxtE7Z8=\" alt='Close up of Pacific Islander woman\"s eye with mechanical lens' data-id=\"166835123\" data-type=\"getty-image\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-credits\">Colin Anderson Productions pty ltd/DigitalVision via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"inline_ad_placeholder\"></div> <p>In January, I concluded that a vision did not translate into actual results in the case of <strong>Cognex (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGNX\" title=\"Cognex Corporation\">CGNX</a></span>)</strong>. The company has been struggling to live up to its potential for years, posting<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stagnant results, but shares still commanded premium valuation multiples in the meantime.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a further fall earlier this year, shares traded at similar levels as January, yet valuations are still very demanding, even if the company returns to post historically high margins, all of which is making me very cautious.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">All About Machine Vision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cognex has a mission to make advanced machine vision easy, which in itself is a hard thing to do. The company describes itself as the clear technology leader within advanced machine vision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps this is best described by comparing the link between the human brain and eyes being applied to machines with optics taking the role of the brain and vision software the role of eyes. This allows machines to guide, identify, and inspect items in various industrial, logistics, and manufacturing environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company employs about 3,000 workers, who generate just shy of a billion in revenues here, with the competitive positioning supported by nearly 1,500 patents issued and patents pending. In terms of geographical coverage, the business is extremely well diversified across the globe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automotive is a key end market, with other markets including logistics, electronics, packaging, and, to a smaller extent, semiconductor applications as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the 2010s, the company more or less tripled sales, with revenues just surpassing the billion mark in 2021. Revenues have been stagnant in the years thereafter due to overinvestments during Covid, more challenging macro conditions (certainly within automotive), and perhaps some execution issues as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boom and subsequent period of stagnation have been seen in the share price as well. A $10 stock in the early 2010s saw shares peak around the $90 mark in 2021, but ever since, shares have come down to the $40 mark at the start of the year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gauging Expectations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, 2023 turned out to be a very tough year, with sales down 17% to $837 million, with adjusted earnings reported at just $0.73 per share. Following the announcement of Japanese-based Moritex and a recovery amidst easy comparables, growth was returning in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full-year results for 2024 were not yet known in January, but it was fair to say that adjusted earnings for the year were only seen around $0.75 per share, flattish compared to 2023. With net cash holdings down to just over a dollar per share, a $40 stock at the start of the year commanded very premium valuation multiples, around 50 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q4-24.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a 9% increase in 2024 sales to $915 million, in between organic growth reported and the contribution of Moritex. So far the good news is that adjusted earnings only rose by a penny to $0.74 per share, with margins lagging here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company failed to issue a full-year guidance for 2025 but only provided a guidance for the first quarter, with sales seen between $200 and $220 million, as EBITDA margins were seen between 12% and 15% of sales.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025: Mixed Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hurt by some currency headwinds, first-quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q1/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q1-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by just 2% to $216 million, although margins were much stronger, with adjusted earnings up five cents to $0.16 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q2/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q2-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">were</a> up 4% to $249 million as adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share look solid but rose by just two pennies on the year before. Over the summer, the company <a href=\"https://investor.cognex.com/news/news-details/2025/Cognex-Announces-New-Leadership-Team-to-Drive-Strategic-Growth-and-Innovation/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a new leadership team under new CEO Matt Moschner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the ambitions, the company saw mixed results as activist investor Engaged Capital <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506284-cognex-gains-after-activst-engaged-capital-reports-stake\">reported</a> a stake in the business in the fall, citing potential for huge upside in the shares, believing that new management could boost margins by 1000 basis points over time, in line with previous performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of October, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q3/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q3-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> an 18% increase in third-quarter sales to $277 million, yet the results benefited from a one-time contribution from a commercial partnership with a medical lab automation channel partner, with revenues otherwise up 13%. Adjusted earnings rose from twenty cents to $0.33 per share, or to $0.28 per share if we adjust for the commercial partnership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Somewhat disappointing is that stronger momentum is set to slow down dramatically in the fourth quarter, which is surprising after the stronger momentum and new leadership being in place. Fourth quarter sales are seen between $230 and $245 million, suggesting a flattish to 7% increase in sales on an annual basis, with adjusted earnings of $0.19-$0.24 per share, largely in line with a $0.20 per share number reported in the final quarter of 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Cognex fell from $47 to $40 upon the release of the results, with the fourth quarter outlook feeling a bit soft. Right now, realistic earnings are seen just shy of a dollar per share this year, a dramatic improvement from 2024 numbers, but still translating into demanding multiples around 40 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net cash holdings stand at $600 million, and with 170 million shares outstanding, net cash holdings stand around $3.50 per share. Down to the $40 mark, operating asset valuations stand at $36.50 per share, for a 37-38 times earnings multiple. Operating assets are here valued around $6.2 billion, and with sales seen close to a billion, sales multiples are seen around 6.5 times sales here. In part to undoubtedly please investors, the dividend was hiked by 6%, now payable at $0.32 per share each year, for a yield below a percent here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, Cognex has seen somewhat of a more resilient performance in 2025. While revenue and earnings growth is seen, and valuation multiples have come in, overall valuations remain very demanding. The risk-reward proposition still is not looking too favorable here despite long-term drivers in place related to labor shortages, inflation, and the need for automation, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its peak, Cognex managed to post operating margins around 30% of sales. If that happens on a current one billion revenue base, after-tax earnings could come in around a quarter of a billion, equal to earnings around $1.50 per share.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if this becomes a reality, it still is hard to justify the current valuations of the operating assets at a mid-twenty times earnings multiple. All this makes me continue to bark at current valuations, even if down over half from the highs in a post-pandemic environment.</p>",

CoreWeave added a $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI and a massive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500180-coreweave-pops-amid-new-14b-deal-with-meta-for-ai-power\">$14.2 billion deal</a> with Meta Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), both of which indicate Core Scientific could land an expanded contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While approval of the deal could release CoreWeave to trade higher and provide more value to Core Scientific shareholders, the best solution is probably to just cancel the merger and let the stock prices adjust to market values. After all, both IREN and TeraWulf have tripled since July 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that the timing of the CoreWeave planned acquisition of Core Scientific didn't make a lot of sense. With CoreWeave facing a major lock-up expiration right after the deal announcement and the natural distraction from the major AI data center growth opportunity, the stocks haven't performed well during this period.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific has already rallied into the shareholder vote on October 30, but the stock would appear to have more upside. Not to mention, the company appears past due for additional contracts that would juice the stock.</p>",

It also provided a tailwind for the convertible market, where issuers tend to be small- and mid-cap focused companies. This cohort stands to benefit as equity market leadership broadens beyond mega-cap technology stocks—a development we believe represents a significant opportunity, supported by both fundamental momentum and the historical benefits of rate-cutting cycles for these types of companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, we anticipate continued pro-growth fiscal policies combined with a data-dependent but increasingly accommodative monetary policy framework. Markets have advanced strongly from the tariff-induced concerns earlier in the year and may experience periods of volatility into year-end as investors debate the magnitude of recent gains. Nevertheless, we believe risk assets can continue to benefit from strong fundamental momentum across our core investment themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hybrid structure of convertible securities—combining equity-like growth potential with bond-like risk-mitigation characteristics—offers an attractive risk-reward proposition in this environment. We believe active management remains essential, as each convertible security offers unique structural features that can evolve over time, making disciplined security selection and ongoing portfolio management critical to optimizing return profiles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jon Vacko, CFA</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>SVP and Senior Co-Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joe Wysocki, CFA</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>SVP and Senior Co-Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">October 2, 2025</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strong equity market performance in the third quarter contributed to convertibles with the most equity sensitivity (+11.5%), outperforming convertibles with total-return attributes (+10.4%) and those with the most bond sensitivity (+5.1%). At the end of the quarter, convertibles with total-return attributes (39% of the market) exceeded convertibles with the most bond sensitivity (35%) and equity-sensitive attributes (26%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All economic sectors within the US convertible market delivered positive results in the third quarter. Leading sectors included materials (+50.6%), real estate (+21.3%), and industrials (+21.2%). The sectors that lagged the index by the most included consumer staples (+1.0%), communication services (+3.0%), and financials (+3.9%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unrated convertibles (+10.1%) outperformed speculative-grade rated (+5.7%) and investment-grade rated (+4.6%) issues. According to ICE BofA, roughly 79% of the US convertible market was unrated on average at the end of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global new convertible issuance totaled $54.4 billion in the third quarter. It represented one of the most robust third-quarter volumes in recent memory, catapulting the year-to-date total above $125 billion. This strength reflects how companies strategically use convertibles as a cost-effective tool for capitalizing on growth opportunities and refinancing other forms of debt. We expect this favorable issuance environment to persist into year-end and beyond.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CICVX\" title=\"Calamos Convertible Fund Institutional Class\">CICVX</a></span>) returned 9.11% (Class I shares at NAV) versus the ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index return of 8.58%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Positive Influences on Performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Information Technology</strong>. The fund’s leading security selection in information technology helped buoy relative performance. Technology hardware, storage &amp; peripherals notably helped, as did communications equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer Discretionary</strong>. Favorable security selection and an average underweight position in consumer discretionary added to returns, especially in the broadline retail and homefurnishing retail industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Negative Influences on Performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Real Estate</strong>. Security selection and an average underweight allocation within the real estate sector weakened returns. Specifically, data center REITs and our lack of exposure to real estate services held back relative results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Communication Services</strong>. Security selection and an average overweight position in communication services lost ground on a relative basis, specifically in the movies &amp; entertainment and alternative carriers industries.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Holdings - Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bloom Energy Corp.

Its flagship product, the Bloom Energy Server, converts fuels like natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen into electricity through an efficient electrochemical process without combustion. The company serves customers in healthcare, data centers, manufacturing, and utilities with reliable, low-emission energy technologies. Bloom Energy was incorporated in 2001 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bloom Energy’s stock and convertible securities advanced significantly during the quarter, driven by surging demand for its fuel cell technology to power AI data centers, as highlighted by its major partnership with Oracle. Additionally, bullish analyst upgrades and price target hikes—some more than doubling prior estimates—fueled investor enthusiasm, while strong Q2 earnings and revenue growth reinforced confidence in the company’s operational momentum. We view Bloom Energy as a rapidly scaling clean energy leader, combining upside exposure to AI-driven power demand and hydrogen innovation with downside protection through its fixed-income characteristics of its convertible, which offers the opportunity to participate in Bloom Energy’s common stock with a favorable yield advantage over the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western Digital Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.00% Convertible due 2028 | 1.8% of fund as of 09/30/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Western Digital Corporation is a leading global provider of data storage solutions, specializing in hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and flash-based memory products. The company designs and manufactures devices used in everything from personal computing and mobile devices to data centers and enterprise infrastructure. It was founded in 1970 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Western Digital’s stock and convertible securities advanced during the quarter, fueled by surging demand for AI and cloud storage infrastructure, which drove strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The rally was further supported by bullish analyst upgrades, a strategic HDD-Flash business split (Sandisk), debt reduction, and shareholder-friendly actions like buybacks and dividends. Western Digital is now a pure-play hard disk drive provider following the separation of its Flash business, allowing for a more focused strategy and streamlined operations. Its leadership in advanced UltraSMR technology and an aggressive product roadmap position it to benefit from accelerating AI-driven infrastructure and storage demand growth. Western Digital’s balance sheet is improving, and the convertible offers participation in the underlying stock tied to accelerating AI and cloud storage demand with a favorable yield advantage compared to the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Holdings - Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategy Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR\" title=\"Strategy Inc\">MSTR</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.00% Convertible due 2030 | 2.4% of fund as of 09/30/25 0.875% Convertible due 2031 | 1.3% of fund as of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Strategy Inc., together with its subsidiaries, advances bitcoin Treasury related strategies that provide varying degrees of economic exposure to cryptocurrency. In addition, the company provides artificial intelligence-powered enterprise analytics software and services globally. It was incorporated in 1989 and is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> During the quarter, Strategy Inc.’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR\" title=\"Strategy Inc\">MSTR</a>) stock and convertibles declined partly due to investor debate around the company’s leverage and dilution risk. Additionally, Bitcoin experienced a period of consolidation after strong gains in the prior quarter. Despite this, the company continued to successfully access the capital markets with its fourth, and largest, preferred security issuance this year. We view investing in the convertible bonds issued by Strategy Inc. as a means of participating in the potential equity upside with measured downside risk and hold a favorable view on their positioning within the overall capital structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Axon Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.25% Convertible due 2027 | 0.8% of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Axon Enterprise, Inc. is a public safety technology company that develops and sells conducted energy weapons under the TASER brand, along with body cameras, in-car video systems, and cloud-based digital evidence management platforms. Axon serves law enforcement, military, corrections, and private security agencies across more than 100 countries. Its mission is to protect life and accelerate justice through a connected ecosystem of hardware and software solutions designed to enhance transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency. Axon Enterprise was incorporated in 1993 and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Axon Enterprise’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>) stock and convertible securities declined during the quarter, primarily due to some investor concerns over its acquisition of Prepared, an AI-powered 911 communications company, which raised questions about the acquisition’s fit, the price paid, and the revenue impact, none of which were disclosed. We maintain a constructive view on AXON given its dominant position in TASERs and the fact that it has transformed itself from a TASER-focused business into a differentiated provider of integrated public safety hardware, software, and services with high and growing recurring/subscription/software as a source of revenues. AXON sells into a large and growing market, and its strategy is to further embed customers into the AXON ecosystem through cross-selling body/fleet cameras. As AXON continues this mix shift into software and services, and increasingly incorporates AI into its products, its installed base, margins, and free cash flow should continue to rapidly increase. The convertible offers an opportunity to participate in any continued upside in AXON stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning and Portfolio Changes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our portfolio positioning remains focused on companies poised to benefit from transformative secular and cyclical trends. The AI-related theme continues to be among the strongest across capital markets, impacting virtually every economic sector. These opportunities also align with America-First fiscal policies aimed at rebuilding domestic infrastructure and promoting technology leadership. We continue to selectively identify attractive beneficiaries of these themes, and we believe our strategy of leveraging convertibles to pursue asymmetric payoff profiles (i.e., more exposure to equity market upside than downside) is particularly appropriate for the current environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding economic sectors, the largest portfolio weights are in information technology and industrials on an absolute basis. Conversely, consumer staples and energy represent the smallest absolute sector weights with holdings. On a relative basis, the largest industry overweight positions are systems software and movies &amp; entertainment. The financials and health care sectors constitute the most significant relative underweights. With respect to these sectors, consumer finance and health care equipment are among the underweight industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Allocations to industrials and energy rose during the period with increased weights in heavy electrical equipment and coal &amp; consumable fuels. By contrast, allocations to communication services and health care decreased over the period with reductions to movies &amp; entertainment and health care equipment.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>For additional information or to download a fact sheet, please visit the fund’s profile page:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.calamos.com/funds/mutual/convertible-cicvx/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> CICVX - Convertible Mutual Fund | Calamos Investments</a></p> <p><em><strong>Before investing carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

The rally reflects investor confidence in the company’s expanding aerospace and defense sales<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and execution on its margin expansion strategy. With Ducommun positioned as a Tier 1 supplier benefiting from both defense spending tailwinds and the commercial aerospace recovery, I believe now is an ideal time to reassess the upside potential.

The Commercial aerospace market accounts for 40% of sales while military &amp; space accounts for 57% of sales. Another 3% of the revenues is generated in the industrial markets, but with 97% of sales in the aerospace and defense segment it is a near pure-play aerospace and defense company. The company has content on major commercial airplane programs such as The Boeing Company's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>) Boeing 737, Boeing 787 and Airbus SE's <span>(</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSF</a><span>) </span>Airbus A320 and Airbus A220. Production ramp-ups are not necessarily smooth, and we have seen the ramp-up trajectory being delayed for several programs. Most recently, Airbus <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-delays-some-a220-output-narrowing-window-reach-2026-target-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pushed back</a> the ramp-up schedule for the Airbus A220. However, the clear growth driver is higher production rates as seen on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo and Boeing 787 program and all of those programs have a significant ramp-up schedule ahead. The company can <span>also </span>count the major manufacturers of business jets among its customers such as Bombardier Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDRAF\" title=\"Bombardier Inc.\">OTCQX:BDRAF</a>) and Gulfstream, which is part of General Dynamics Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GD\" title=\"General Dynamics Corporation\">GD</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the defense segment, the company has again Airbus, Boeing and General Dynamics as its customers, but also other names such as General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>), RTX Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC\" title=\"Northrop Grumman Corporation\">NOC</a>) as the company provides solutions for missiles, radars, drones, fighter jets, bombers, war ships and submarines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company does face some transient pressures as OEM destock on balked production ramp-ups, but overall there is a rather positive growth outlook for the company driven by both of its end markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company gets 55% of its sales from electronic systems, which I believe are becoming increasingly more critical for defense markets and 45% comes from aerostructures. Besides revenue growth opportunities, Ducommun is also working on expanding its margins beyond improved operating leverage. The company has shut down facilities in Monrovia and Berryville, which should drive $11-$13 million in annual savings as the company concentrates production in New York and opts for a low-cost footprint expansion in Mexico. Additionally, the company has targeted 25% of revenue to be generated from engineered products, which should come at better margins and higher aftermarket sales. The company is also tracking well on that. Engineered Product sales grew from 9% of sales in 2022 to 23% in 2024 with a target of 25% in 2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Limited Tariff Problems For Ducommun</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1301\" data-height=\"732\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the Ducommun sales and manufacturing exposure.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ducommun</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a facility in Mexico, it is also important to assess the risk and the reality is that the risk is manageable. That is because Mexico represents less than 5% of the manufacturing footprint and sales are highly concentrated in the US with 85% of all sales going to the US distantly followed by 7% for Europe, China at less than 3% and Mexico and Canada representing less than 2% of sales. We also note that aerospace and defense products tend to be excluded from tariffs by default and USMCA compliance can be leveraged to avoid tariffs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street Expectations For Ducommun In Q3 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ducommun will report Q3 2025 earnings on the 6<sup>th</sup> of November. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCO/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">consensus estimate</a> on revenues is $211.9 million indicating 5.2% growth and earnings per share of $0.95 indicating a 3.8% decline likely reflecting some of the transient pressures I mentioned earlier. The estimated range on revenues is $211.3-$212.3 million and for EPS it is $0.89-$1.01. We note that there have been no major revisions over the past three and six months for revenues, but estimates on EPS have come down by 11% over the past three months and 6.9% over the past six months. The company does not have a perfect track record of beating Wall Street estimates. Over the past two years, the company missed estimates on revenues once and twice on EPS.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ducommun Has Significant Upside Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To determine multi-year price targets, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">The Aerospace Forum</a> has developed a stock screener that uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data.

That easy upside was the simple fact that the company was trading at levels that did not value the expected earnings in 2025 or the realized earnings in 2025. At current prices, the stock is more or less fairly valued for 2025 earnings. As we are heading into 2026, I believe we should look at the earnings for 2026 which provide a $112 price target indicating 19% upside. I feel that it is still justified to maintain a strong buy rating as I typically set stock price targets based on earnings a year ahead and as we head into 2026, we normally are looking at target levels for 2027. For Ducommun, even without doing that we see upside and the stock is substantially undervalued against peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On EBITDA estimates, there have been no major changes. For this year, estimates rose 1.4% and for 2026 by 2.6% and a small reduction in expectations of 0.4% in 2027. This provides a total uplift in EBITDA between 2025 and 2027 of 1.3% and a slight CAGR contraction measured from 2024 from 13.7% to 13.5%. On free cash flow, we see a 6.5% upward revision for 2025, but it's down 1.6% in 2026 and 10% in 2027. That is a total reduction to the estimates of 4.6%, but CAGR still stands at 54.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2305\" data-height=\"1309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the key metrics for Ducommun by The Aerospace Forum.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Aerospace Forum</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the key metric, we see a promising trajectory. Sales are expected to grow 6.5% annually, but perhaps more importantly, EBITDA margins are expected to improve substantially from 13.4% to 18% by 2027. We also see better cash conversion and capital expenditures as a percentage of operating cash flow coming down substantially. The company should be able to bring down its debt substantially and by 2027, the leverage should come down substantially. The company does not pay a dividend and it also does not repurchase shares but with a healthy leverage it could opt to return cash to shareholders. Currently, that is not baked into my estimates but we do see a substantial improvement in the financials that could enable it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Ducommun Remains Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that Ducommun remains attractive. We note that there may be some transient pressures driven by delayed production ramp-ups and facilities going through learning curves. However, we see strong end market growth in commercial aerospace and defense that the company serves through aerostructure and microelectronics. In my view, that is a very nice business to be active in right now and Ducommun is a supplier to almost all original equipment manufacturers in aerospace and defense which provides them with a wide array of growth platforms for which growing demand could lead to potential outsourcing of work to Ducommun and the company has increased its focus on engineered products which come with less competition and actually no competition since Ducommun owns the IP rights and higher margins. So, I remain positive on the company’s prospects going into 2026 and reiterate my strong buy rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Revenues are projected to rise another 3 to 4<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> percent in 2025, showing the continued strength of a sector that grows even as broader media habits shift. What drives this momentum is accessibility, digital connectivity, and cultural ubiquity. Gaming today spans generations, with nearly half of players identifying as female and a rising share of older adults now playing weekly. It is no longer just a pastime; it has become a primary channel for entertainment, creativity, and social interaction.</span></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s Not Just Kids Playing Video Games</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/fe641a483cde4f03942461c0dc5a758c/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-1_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"It's Not Just Kids Playing Video Games\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: theesa.com as of 02.2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, the gaming business model has matured. Mobile now accounts for about half of global industry revenues, and in-game spending has become the dominant source of monetization. The shift from one-time purchases to ongoing digital transactions has created more predictable revenue streams and stronger engagement cycles. As studios continue to extend the lifespan of popular titles through updates, expansions, and live events, gaming has become a recurring digital economy rather than a series of standalone releases.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/32286833de3e4a9b9d4246baabc0a431/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-2_2025-10_v1.svg\" alt=\"In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Statista, as of 06.2025.

Over the past year, strong results from Nintendo, Roblox, and NetEase show how publishers are finding new ways to expand engagement and monetize their audiences. AppLovin was a standout contributor, as its AI-driven ad platform helped developers optimize user acquisition and improve profitability. Tencent also added to returns through steady performance across its global gaming operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of these names, including AppLovin, Tencent, and AMD, are no longer part of the index due to ESPO’s strict requirement that at least half of company revenue come from gaming and esports. This approach ensures exposure stays pure and aligns with the industry’s long-term growth drivers, not broader tech trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key themes behind performance include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expansion of mobile and in-game revenue models supporting recurring growth.</li> <li>Strong content pipelines from global publishers extending franchise longevity.</li> <li>Increased use of AI tools in development, marketing, and player engagement.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Acceleration Moment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Artificial intelligence is emerging as the next major catalyst for gaming. In his recent appearance on the Thoughtful Money podcast, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck discussed how <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/investment-outlook/jan-van-eck-q4-2025-outlook-escaping-the-reckoning/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"Q4 2025 Outlook: Escaping the Reckoning?\">AI may be undervalued</a> by markets when it comes to creative industries. He noted that the leveraged buyout of Electronic Arts highlights how investors may be missing the intersection between AI and gaming’s potential for innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming companies are poised to embrace AI faster than many other industries because experimentation and rapid iteration are already central to their culture. AI streamlines every layer of the value chain, from how games are made, to how they are played, to how they are marketed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Developers are using AI to build and test new worlds in days instead of months. Gameplay is becoming more adaptive, with storylines and NPCs that respond to player behavior. Studios are marketing smarter, using data to target players and personalize content. Together, these advances are reshaping production cycles, improving engagement, and expanding profitability potential across the ecosystem.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/7ea254e910a340fa9a339851ce013e5b/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-3_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Konvoy, as of 2025. For illustrative purposes only.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming’s New Playbook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The intersection of gaming and AI represents one of the most compelling growth frontiers in digital media. As AI tools lower production costs, enhance storytelling, and deepen engagement, gaming is positioned to remain one of the most globally connected and innovative industries. Leadership within the space will evolve, but the underlying growth drivers, including scalable intellectual property, recurring digital revenues, and expanding player engagement, remain firmly intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck ESPO ETF captures this evolution through a focused portfolio of companies at the heart of the video gaming and esports ecosystem. By maintaining strict inclusion criteria and global diversification, it offers exposure to a sector that is not only growing but redefining how entertainment, technology, and digital identity intersect.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Approaching the Video Gaming and eSports Opportunity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, gaining exposure to this fast-changing sector requires focus. The video gaming and esports industry spans publishers, hardware manufacturers, and software platforms that directly generate revenue from interactive entertainment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF tracks the MVIS Global Video Gaming and eSports Index, which includes companies deriving at least 50 percent of revenue from gaming and esports-related activities. This rule ensures that the portfolio remains centered on companies truly driving industry growth rather than broader tech conglomerates with peripheral exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By combining exposure across publishers, developers, and hardware makers, the <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/video-gaming-esports-etf-espo\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"ESPO - VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF - Overview\">VanEck ESPO ETF</a> provides a comprehensive view into one of the most creative, innovative, and high-growth corners of global media.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT\" title=\"Caterpillar Inc.\">CAT</a></span>) this year. By now, it appears that I've likely missed something as the stock has rallied ~40% since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4820597-caterpillar-tariffs-continue-to-wreak-havoc-on-profitability\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">my latest article.</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> In that analysis I found signs that tariffs were wreaking havoc on the company's profitability and with the valuation being elevated I thought the risk/reward was unattractive. Caterpillar seems to have found a new catalyst: AI.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the analysis <span>below</span>, it is shown that AI is powering strong results in their Energy &amp; Transportation segment. While that's great news, tariff headwinds are alive and well. Profitability was significantly eroded with operating profit and EPS both declining YoY despite good demand. While there should be some optimism as a result of AI tailwinds, I believe the forward P/E's rapid expansion since the middle of the year shows that there has been too much exuberance with no easy fix for the company's profitability woes. The stock trades at a hefty premium and since there seems to be overvaluation, I have decided to stick with my sell rating for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"649\" data-height=\"233\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rating History\" width=\"640\" height=\"230\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand Is Picking Up</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"670\" data-height=\"421\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"402\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"402\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caterpillar reported <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/3q25/3q25-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2025 Q3 earnings</a> just very recently on October 29th and top-line results show signs that demand is starting to pick up. We'll go into more depth regarding where this strength is coming from a bit later but for Q3, the company as a whole reported sales and revenues of $17.638 billion. This is a fresh all-time record for Caterpillar and it represents growth of 10% YoY. That is a major bounce back after <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/2q25/2q25-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 1% decline in sales and revenues</a> in their Q2 and so business activity has taken a major turn for the better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, they smashed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT/earnings\">consensus expectations</a> as they beat them by a whopping $864.15 million. Even for a company of their size, that is a substantial beat and so their top line was a pleasant surprise for sure. <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/358376879/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/3Q-2025-Analyst-Slide-Deck-vFinal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the above chart</a> you can see that sales volume was the major driver for growth, again indicating that business activity has improved significantly. There was some minor weakness in price realization that may be an indication of an unfavorable mix but the effects are really negligible when compared to the considerable increase in volume. Lastly, as another sign that demand is becoming robust, Caterpillar reported that their backlog has hit $39.8 billion, a fresh all-time record. Of course, this is welcome news for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy &amp; Transportation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"719\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Energy\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As promised, let's see where all the top-line strength is coming from. Their Energy &amp; Transportation segment is currently their largest segment both by sales and profit and in Q3, it saw by far the strongest results. This is the segment that's directly involved with AI since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510198-caterpillar-stock-jumps-as-ai-fueled-energy-demand-lifts-earnings\">AI data centers use</a> Caterpillar's battery storage systems and backup generators. I, for one, did not foresee AI providing significant tailwinds to their business but here we are and it really acts as a saviour to the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see above, total sales jumped by 17% YoY as they reported strong sales volume. Their Construction segment saw growth of just 7% while their Resource segment had just 2% growth. The importance of their Energy &amp; Transport segment doesn't end there, however. While profit margin expanded by 10 basis points in this segment, the other two segments saw considerable margin contraction and so in addition to driving top-line growth, AI tailwinds seem to be doing the heavy lifting in terms of the company's profitability. Overall, with AI data center construction showing no signs of slowing down, Caterpillar seems well-positioned to continue benefitting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs Still A Headwind</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tariffs\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"280\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the above chart, the factors affecting operating profit are shown. Despite a healthy growth rate for the top line, operating profit actually fell 3% YoY to $3.052 billion. As you can see, the sales volume strength and price realization weakness carried over from their sales and revenues figures but the main cause of profitability weakness was due to manufacturing costs. In their earnings release, Caterpillar stated that \"unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs.\" This shows that despite the AI tailwinds they are benefitting from, the tariff headwinds that I highlighted in my previous article are still alive and well. If it weren't for the margin strength in their Energy &amp; Transportation segment, things could have been much worse for their profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of profits, Caterpillar reported an adjusted EPS of $4.95 for Q3, representing a 4.26% decline YoY. While that's still undesirable, do note that in Q2, they experienced a 21.2% decline for EPS and so there has been notable improvement. In addition, they managed to beat expectations by $0.43 to show outperformance and so despite the YoY decline, results were still better than feared.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Flows &amp; Capital Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the profitability weakness, Caterpillar managed a nice improvement in cash flows. The company reported ME&amp;T free cash flows of $3.2 billion, representing an ~$500 million increase over the prior year period. While this is, of course, good news, shareholders may not be too thrilled that capital returns actually dropped YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Caterpillar distributed a total of $1.1 billion, ~$700 million in the form of dividends and ~$400 million in the form of share repurchases. While total dividend payout remained relatively stable <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/3q24/3q24-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the year-ago quarter,</a> stock buybacks dropped significantly YoY from ~$800 million. Therefore, while FCFs improved, the company doesn't seem too eager to share the cash with shareholders. That could be a sign of cautiousness from management.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caterpillar provided limited numeric financial guidance but still gave some broad ideas of how the outlook is shaping up. For full year 2025, they now expect sales and revenues to be modestly higher than in 2024. This is a change in language from \"slightly higher\" and so in essence, they have raised their guidance. For Q4 in particular, they are expecting \"strong\" sales and revenue growth and so it appears that the AI tailwinds are indeed going to continue for their Energy &amp; Transportation business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With or without tariff effects included, Caterpillar expects the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be in their annual target range. However, without tariffs, the figure would be in the top half of the range while with tariffs, the figure would be in the bottom half. Therefore, for 2025 as a whole, tariffs will be a significant drag on the company's profitability. Overall, I would say there are not many surprises in their outlook as the AI boost to sales and profitability weakness were already seen in their Q3.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors May Be Overoptimistic</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see in the chart above, Caterpillar's forward P/E ratio has been in a quite steady uptrend over the past few years. Since the middle of this year, it seems the expansion has picked up speed, and I believe the current reading of 31.45 shows excessive optimism.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, investors should definitely cheer the arrival of AI tailwinds. I, personally, did not foresee AI data centers having such a profound impact on their Energy &amp; Transportation business and so it's a pleasant surprise. However, the company is not out of the woods. Growth in their other two segments is still relatively sluggish and more importantly tariffs are weighing heavily on profitability. It is unlikely to be an easy fix for profitability as tariffs are really beyond the control of Caterpillar and so while overall demand is back on a good trajectory, headwinds are eroding that positivity as seen by the decline in operating profit and EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I believe investors who are piling into the stock due to the new association with AI have become overoptimistic regarding their outlook. Note that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha shows</a> the stock is trading at a nearly 50% premium to the Industrials sector according to the non-GAAP forward P/E ratio. Therefore, I would be very cautious about the current valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Remarks</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are some good signs for Caterpillar, in my view investors have gotten ahead of themselves. The elephant in the room was the big boost provided by AI tailwinds but while many are focusing on the resulting improved demand, I believe overlooking the profitability woes would be a mistake. Despite all the optimism, the company's profits actually shrank YoY due to tariffs and with no easy fix to this issue, I would say the outlook is still only mixed. Meanwhile, as shown above, the forward P/E has roared to a multiyear high and is at a major premium to the sector. I believe this shows investors have become a bit too exuberant on the stock. With Caterpillar being overvalued, I have decided to maintain my sell rating at this point.</p>",

Furthermore, unlike many of its peers, it<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> has not been suffering from excessive or overly high valuation levels.

So am I. The company has declined despite what I believe to be a significant improvement in prospects and also somewhat in fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's look at what we have here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plenty to like, even if the valuation isn't as great</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infineon is, in large part, a play on things like automotive chip/semiconductor markets. That means if you're bearish or not excessively bullish on the EV trends currently permeating the market, you should (like me) take a somewhat more conservative stance on the company and its potential. Not that it's going to go negative or anything - just not as bullish as some perhaps tend to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's wrong, however, to say it's <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>just<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> EVs. Even the new generation of ICE vehicles needs all manner of sensors - voltage chips and the like, which are supplied by a market leader like Infineon. As I've mentioned earlier, the company is a great player in power efficiency in general, and if you notice what industries across the world are doing, power conservation is definitely part of this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High-level risks to a legacy, Europe-located company such as this are very macro-oriented. We could mention the fact that China seems very set on developing its own chip industry in the country, but this also needs consideration that Infineon is actually a business that focuses on discrete power, rather than analog power management ICs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"995\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Infineon 3Q25 IR Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Infineon <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what the heck is the difference?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, the former, which is Infineon's focus, are things like transistors and resistors - while the latter are things like so-called PMICs, that combine functions in a single <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>die<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>.

Also, it forces Infineon to have manufacturing capacity different from its peers, leading to higher fixed costs in a scenario where supply exceeds demand. Because much of the demand comes from the automotive industry, this means that you should be prepared for volatility. Infineon has actually, as of the last few years, focused more on its automotive and industrial sectors, essentially increasing its exposure to that volatility in turn (divesting smaller business parts).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while arguments in its favor are healthy growth from increases in products from Infineon, both in ICE and EVs, there is a commodity characteristic to the business that is hard to get away from.

I've covered both STM and ON - but aside from ON (which has a different risk profile) Infineon is probably the more attractive of these at this time - I'll show this to you in valuation. My point here is that for what the company does, there aren't that many significant players in the field, and Infineon is by far the biggest one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With very solid <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> results, and an estimate for 2025E fiscal that is sort of a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>kitchen sink<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> year, Infineon is poised to see recovery and growth from the automotive trend shift that we've been able to slightly confirm with businesses like Autoliv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALV\" title=\"Autoliv, Inc.\">ALV</a>) (albeit a slow trend shift).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The right way to invest in Infineon here is, I believe, for a 3-4 year timeframe. That's the time required to see growth materialize here, but once it does, we can see a significant and market-beating rate of return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last quarter of 2025E, which reports in about 2-3 weeks, is unlikely to change things here. While my expectation is for the company to return to growth in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">4Q25</em> with demand recovery for its products, the YoY results for 2025E are likely to be negative to the tune of a double-digit EPS decline.

That PT still holds. The company is currently trading at €34.3. I considered raising my PT and fair value targets here, but ultimately decided that they still serve. However, I will make it clear here that once things start to grow, I will be raising the fair value and PT's to better reflect what I believe Infineon in a growth environment to be capable of, which is closer to a €50/share fair value at a 20x P/E for the 2028E fiscal, which would in turn imply a PT of about €42/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But this requires better results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, buying at this valuation comes with a significant upside both to my previous fair value target of €38-€39/share, but also to a longer-term upside. The longer-term annualized RoR here is 15-16% per year at a 5-10 year average, and over 16% at the average 20-year P/E.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1708\" data-height=\"1336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs Upside Infineon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span><span></span>F.A.S.T. Graphs <span> Upside Infineon</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, since my last article, Infineon has dropped to valuations I would consider investable here. The combination of upside from 2026-2028E from a recovering automotive market, with the relatively low valuation and the company currently being in a dip, implies this. The fundamentals are reflective of this as well, including a BBB+ credit rating, a 1% yield (low, but safe, and growing), very low debt at below 22% long-term debt/capital, and a market cap, even with the drop, of below €44B at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better alternatives with a similar risk profile are very rare at this time. You could make an argument for STMicroelectronics, which I've also made in a recent article where I covered the company. The upside is 15-17% here as well. I consider Infineon better than STM because of the depth of the EPS drop in STM; however, at this time it is expected to drop by over 60%. Infineon is, simply put, safer here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Texas Instruments, meanwhile, is in a remarkably similar trend as this company, with the exception of no near-term crash (the crash for TXN was in 2024, not 2025, also at about 24%). The issue I have with TXN is the forward valuation premium. This company requires 23-25x P/E to outperform, at 20x P/E like Infineon, it's essentially 0% growth or thereabouts - negative without the impressive 3.5%+ dividend that the company pays.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1720\" data-height=\"1340\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs TXN Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"499\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span><span></span>F.A.S.T. Graphs <span> TXN Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, ON Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON\" title=\"ON Semiconductor Corporation\">ON</a>) may be undervalued, but it is also incredibly volatile and currently has no yield. Its range in the last 52 weeks has been between $31 and $76, which should express the depth of that volatility. The company is also, out of these, the only one with a junk-graded investment rating, and at 15x P/E, the 20-year average, is set to give less than 15% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I therefore consider ON to be uninvestable here as well, with regard to my targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That brings alternatives to either STM or Infineon - and my choice here is Infineon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">&amp;</em> Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Infineon were to significantly outperform and some risk factors were not to be as severe as expected, then price targets and fair values could go up to a €38/share or above mark, an attractive price target. Furthermore, historically, we've been able to see valuation levels of over 30x P/E, and if these come back, then the current valuation of 25x P/E is only the beginning. But as things currently stand, Infineon is set to recover as the automotive sector recovers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Significant risks for the company at this valuation are more general in nature. Commoditization of its industry, lower gross margins than its peers, and cyclicality not only of semis, but of end industries can cause further volatility, and for the recovery to take longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond that, I do not view there to be many significant risks to my thesis and price target at this time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infineon is a very solid business with a good long-term upside. It has sector leadership in multiple, crucial segments in the chip industry, and despite the commoditization of some of its end markets as well as the competitive position from China, I do not view it as unlikely that the company may outperform over the long term. In fact, I view it as likely, and this makes it a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">Buy</em><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> at the right price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't see anything in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> or the coming <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">4Q25</em> to change my thesis or expectation for the company from my assumption of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">buy</em>, which leads me, as of this time, to increase my rating back to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">buy</em>, and I maintain my previous PT of €35/share and fair value of €38-€39/share.

Clearly, the price action suggests that the market is not convinced that we will lose a significant amount of Russian oil supply. Yesterday’s meeting between President Trump and President Xi only served to strengthen this conviction, with Russian oil flows to China apparently not part of broader talks between the two leaders. This is important for the market given that China imports around 2m b/d of Russian oil. It’s the only buyer that could meaningfully increase its purchases if India reduced its imports of Russian crude.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Sunday, OPEC+ is set to meet. It appears likely that the group will agree to another 137k b/d supply increase for December. The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase. However, the move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026. Obviously, this is assuming no supply shocks from Russia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle distillate cracks remain well-supported, with lingering uncertainty over the impact of sanctions on Russian diesel exports. The ICE gasoil crack is holding around $30/bbl, after a strong rally since mid-October. However, the latest data from Insights Global shows that gasoil inventories in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region increased by 109kt WoW to 2.27mt, which saw its gap to the 5-year average widen. In Singapore, meanwhile, after a significant increase in middle distillate stocks the previous week, stocks declined by 6.25m barrels over the last week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US natural gas Dec’25 futures rallied 3.7% yesterday, and the strength has continued in early morning trading today. The move higher comes despite US natural gas inventories rising by 74 bcf over the last week, in line with expectations and above the 5-year average increase of 67 bcf. Instead, the market appears to be focused on forecasts for cooler weather, which should prove supportive of demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Agriculture - China to buy 25mt of US soybeans annually</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBOT soybean futures extended their upward rally, with prices surging more than 1.9% at one stage yesterday. This was after President Donald Trump announced that China would immediately purchase large volumes of US soybeans. Later, the US administration said that China agreed to buy 12mt of soybeans between now and January, with a further commitment to purchase at least 25mt annually over the next three years. The announced purchases are largely in line with China's imports of US soybeans prior to the trade war. For reference, China imported around 22mt of US soybeans in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest fortnightly report from the Brazilian Sugarcane and Bioenergy Industry Association (UNICA) shows that sugarcane crushing in Central-South Brazil stood at 34mt over the first half of October, an increase of 0.3% year-on-year. Sugar output over this period rose 1.25% YoY to 2.48mt. Meanwhile, the sugar mix in CS Brazil over the fortnight was 48.2%, up from 47.3% a year ago. This is despite prices suggesting that mills should favour a stronger ethanol mix. The cumulative cane crush so far this season still lags last year, down 2.8% to stand at 525mt, while cumulative sugar production totals 36mt, up 0.9% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.
