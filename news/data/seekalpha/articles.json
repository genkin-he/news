Here, in the MoPay batch, lie affordable (yet<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> volatile and risky) bargains.

Thus, the Dogcatcher yield-based strategy for this MoPay group, as graded by broker estimates this month, proved 40% accurate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimated dividend payouts from $1000 invested in each of the ten highest-yielding stocks, plus analysts median 1yr target prices for those stocks, as reported by YCharts, produced the gain estimates below. (Note: target prices from lone analysts were not counted.)

Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as \"dogs.\" More specifically, these are, in fact, best called \"underdogs\".</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>October Monthly Pay Dividend Data</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three lists produce numerous actionable conclusions and several more un-numbered results. To draw these conclusions and results, September 29, 2025 closing prices and estimated annual dividends were referenced from YCharts. In the process, monthly pay equity (1) yield and (2) upside potential lists were compared and contrasted against (3) the high yield (and higher risk) MoPay CEICs/ETFs/ETNs list.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Monthly Pay Dividend Qualities</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly, Semi-Annual and Annual dividend investors anxiously await announcements from a firm, fund, or brokerage to learn if their next dividend will be higher, lower, or paid at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Monthly pay stocks, funds, trusts, and partnerships inform the holder every four and one third weeks by check and/or statement. If the entity reduces or suspends a payment, the holder can sell out of the investment immediately to avoid future loss of income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This advantage has been curtailed when companies suddenly cut monthly dividends to save cash. Numerous prominent MoPay firms declared dividend cuts between May and June, 2020, including: Oxford Square Capital Corp; Partners Real Estate Investment Trust; Orchid Island Capital Inc; Cross Timbers Royalty Trust; H&amp;R Real Estate Investment Trust; BTB Real Estate Investment Trust; American Finance Trust Inc; Mesa Royalty Trust; Solar Senior Capital Ltd; Ellington Financial Inc; Dividend Select 15 Corp; Chesswood Group Ltd; Sabine Royalty Trust; TORC Oil &amp; Gas Ltd; Freehold Royalties Ltd; ARC Resources Ltd; Inter Pipeline Ltd; San Juan Basin Royalty Trust; Ag Growth International.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Former MoPay top ten regular by yield. Bluerock Residential announced December 2019 it was retreating to quarterly dividend payments \"in keeping with industry tradition.\" Bluerock Residential company has since gone private and is no longer listed publicly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That \"industry tradition\" continued with Armour Residential REIT and Stellus Capital Investment Corp both transitioned to Q Pay in June, 2020. Within three months, however, both SCM and ARR returned to MoPay mode.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top yield stock for July, 2018, June 2021, and December 2023, Orchid Island Capital, released this cautionary note with its monthly dividend announcements back in 2018: \"The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORC directors proceeded to back-up their words with actions cutting the dividend from $0.14 to $0.11 in February, to $0.09 in March, to $0.08 in September, 2018, and to $0.055 for May, 2020. However in August. 2020 ORC monthly dividend increased from $0.06 to $0.065 for September, October, and into 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORC, however, currently pays a $0.12 monthly dividend (falling from $0.16 in October, 2023) and is again listed here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. stock market MoPay segment is volatile, transitive, recovering, and since 2024 has achieved recovery to near full strength. More trades in monthly pay equities are available from Canadian firms, many of which are also listed on U.S. OTC (pink sheet) exchanges.

Last month they were 4% lower. Last June they were 1% higher. The price differences are caused by the outlandishly high dividends offered by a few of the top equities or funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month the top fund dividend is at 36.14%, whereas the top equity pays just 20.09%. Nevertheless, equities are usually cheaper than funds because equities are not loaded with the high overhead costs of fund management.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Background and Actionable Conclusions</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In June 2012 readers suggested the author include these funds, trusts, and partnerships in the MoPay article.

AI, for example, depends heavily on how quickly data centers and power grid infrastructure can be built. Widespread adoption of EVs, for its part, requires charging systems and supportive electrical grid infrastructure. Meanwhile, rising trade tensions have countries racing to expand domestic manufacturing for strategic technologies, such as AI chips and EV batteries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, supporting larger, more urban populations while mitigating impacts from climate change requires a staggering amount of infrastructure, such as modernized power grids, clean water infrastructure, and residential buildings. It is estimated that roughly half of the buildings that will need to exist globally by 2050 have yet to be constructed.<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through 2040, investments totaling $106 trillion may be needed to meet the world’s infrastructure needs.<sup>4</sup> Transport and logistics infrastructure have the highest projected investment requirements at $36 trillion. Energy and power infrastructure require an estimated $23 trillion, while digital infrastructure, such as data centers, could require nearly $20 trillion.<sup>5</sup> Social infrastructure, including schools, healthcare facilities, and housing, as well as waste and water, agriculture, and defense infrastructure, could also require trillions in investments.<sup> 6</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Fragmentation Creates New Development Opportunities for U.S. Manufacturing Facilities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boost for infrastructure development from rising trade fragmentation is particularly evident in the United States. In just the first eight months of the second Trump administration, companies announced nearly $1.25 trillion in investments to expand their U.S. manufacturing footprints.<sup>7</sup> Key drivers of this trend are rising geopolitical tensions and shifting federal policies, particularly the implementation of the administration’s extensive tariff scheme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the announcements span a variety of industries, much of the planning pipeline is concentrated in strategic areas. Consumer electronics leads with more than $700 billion in announced U.S. investments, although the category is heavily concentrated in just two companies.<sup>8</sup> Pharmaceutical manufacturing investments total $290 billion across 18 announcements from both domestic and international drugmakers. Semiconductor manufacturers account for 11% of announced investments, with plans to spend $134 billion on top of the $300 billion announced prior to 2025.<sup>9,10</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of July 2025, construction spending on manufacturing accounted for just under 15% of total private construction spending in the United States, a 2.5x increase from January 2021.<sup>11,12</sup> We believe the flurry of investments over 2025 could push manufacturing’s share of construction spending higher over the medium to long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4270\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"820\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aging Infrastructure Is a Common Concern for Developed Economies, Including the United States</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Decades-old assets can slow economic growth and hamper the adoption of disruptive technologies. For example, even though electricity can be viewed as essential to economic and social progress, power grids are frequently underfunded and outdated.<sup>13</sup> In Japan, over two-thirds of transmission infrastructure is at least 20 years old. Nearly half of all transmission infrastructure in the United States and over 40% of assets in the European Union are also at least two decades old.<sup>14</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the United States, inadequate infrastructure conditions extend well beyond the power grid. Despite increased funding over the past four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers only improved the country’s overall infrastructure grade from a C- in 2021 to a C in 2025.<sup>15</sup> Half of the assessed categories received either a D or D+, translating to “Poor, At Risk” status. This means that these nationwide systems are in fair to poor condition and “mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life.”<sup>16</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving the quality of infrastructure in the United States alone could require $9.1 trillion in investments between 2024 and 2033. Over $5 trillion in funding has been allocated, meaning that a multi-trillion-dollar investment gap still needs to be filled by additional public and private spending.<sup>17</sup> Similarly, the European Union faces a $2 trillion infrastructure investment gap when considering expected infrastructure development needs and announced funding through 2040.<sup>18</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"3514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_03-1.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Infrastructure Renaissance Could Emerge from Surging Public and Private Investment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global infrastructure development is increasingly pivotal to the economies of the future. The adoption of disruptive technologies such as AI, the reshoring of strategic supply chains, and the growth of urban populations all depend on how quickly supportive infrastructure can be built. As these demands rise, so too could opportunities for companies – and investors – across the infrastructure development value chain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Green, A., Nangia, J. &amp; Sandri, N.

However, it isn't just going out and buying<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a fund at the largest discount and hoping for the best—though with activist investors on the prowl, that can pay off occasionally. Where the real opportunities open up is generally on a fund's relative discount to its historical past.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In shorter periods, we can see some tactical plays as funds that dip to wide discounts can spring back. Over the longer term, can also be a pretty solid guide, though one always has to consider the current environment or any other potentially fundamental changes that a CEF has undergone. Today, we are looking at two funds that get our 'Buy' rating based on their attractive discount levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, almost all CEFs have a focus on generating relatively higher distribution yields to their investors. With that, both of these names that we are touching on today also deliver monthly distributions to help generate passive monthly cash flow for their shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#1 XAI Octagon Floating Rate &amp; Alternative Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XFLT\" title=\"XAI Octagon Floating Rate &amp; Alternative Income Trust\">XFLT</a>)</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: -2.51</li> <li>Premium/Discount: -14.14%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 17.07%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 3.59%</li> <li>Leverage: 38.19%</li> <li>Managed Assets: $705.5 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://xainvestments.com/funds/funds-floating-rate-alternative-income-term-trust-xflt\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFLT's objective</a> is to \"seek attractive total return with an emphasis on income generation across multiple stages of the credit cycle.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They will do this through \"a dynamically managed portfolio of floating-rate credit instruments and other structured credit investments within the private markets. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of managed assets in senior secured loans, CLO debt, and equity.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XFLT is invested in a hybrid allocation of collateralized loan obligations, both equity and debt tranches. The fund is then also allocated to a higher composition of senior loan exposure. The CLO space has been getting rocked, and even senior loans have been facing pressure due to the Fed starting to cut rates again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XFLT Asset Allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"259\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XFLT Asset Allocation <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the underlying investment instruments are floating-rate-based investments, these are going to see less income generation moving forward with each Fed cut. That's why we've been seeing funds in this space start to adjust their distributions lower—simply unwinding the distribution increases they had seen previously. I wouldn't be too surprised to see additional cuts here either, as the Fed is projected to continue a downward path to their target rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XFLT Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XFLT Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As somewhat of a bonus, thanks to the massive discount that has opened up for the fund, now the actual distribution rate on the NAV comes to 14.66%. That means the portfolio has to generate a materially lower level than what the market price reflects at over 17%. Of course, to reiterate, nearly 15% yield is still quite elevated, and further cutting is likely necessary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further pressure has come in the form of credit issues. These underlying instruments, and where XFLT focuses, are in junk-rated territory. That makes them some of the riskiest, and then you put the leverage that is employed by XFLT on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of leverage on the fund, the publicly traded 6.5% Series 2026 Term Preferred Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XFLT.PR.A\" title=\"XAI Octagon Floating Rate &amp; Alternative Income Trust 6.50% SERIES 31/03/2026 TERM PREF SHS\">XFLT.PR.A</a>) were <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001703079/000121390025098196/ea0260993-01_8k.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">called</a>, with the redemption date on October 31, 2025. This was as they were <a href=\"https://xainvestments.com/knowledge-bank/news/?url=pressrelease-funds-20251001\" rel=\"nofollow\">able to issue a private placement</a> of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares with a 5.92% fixed rate. A slightly lower rate can mean a bit of easing on their borrowing costs, relatively speaking. However, a greater amount is now outstanding, so on an absolute basis, borrowing costs will rise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that said, there are real risks to consider with this fund, and the outlook isn't all roses and sunshine. On the other hand, it is priced in the dumps now, and that makes it look quite appealing for a longer-term investor to consider starting to add further or take an initial stake.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the pain stops is anyone's guess. I personally started to add too early, but that's why I've taken a more cautious approach with dollar-cost averaging in, rather than taking a substantial stake all at once. I also continue to reinvest the monthly payout, which will further add a bit every month. As shares sink lower into penny stock territory (below $5 per share), it is possible that they conduct a reverse split, like we saw from Oxford Lane Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXLC\" title=\"Oxford Lane Capital Corporation\">OXLC</a>) recently.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#2 Flaherty &amp; Crumrine Preferred Income Opportunity Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFO\" title=\"Flaherty &amp; Crumrine Preferred Income Opportunity Fund\">PFO</a>)</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: 2.48</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -6.36%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 6.33%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.41% (4.72% including leverage expenses)</li> <li>Leverage: 37.20%</li> <li>Managed Assets: $216 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.preferredincome.com/pfo-overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PFO's investment objective</a> is \"to provide its common shareholders with high current income consistent with preservation of capital.\" To achieve this, they will invest, \"under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its managed assets in a portfolio of preferred and other income-producing securities. Preferred and other income-producing securities may include, among other things, traditional preferred stock, trust preferred securities, hybrid securities that have characteristics of both equity and debt securities, contingent capital securities, subordinated debt, and senior debt.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other side of XFLT, we have PFO, a fund primarily invested in preferred securities but also contingent convertible (AT1 bonds) securities as well. Where higher short-term rates helped to boost funds like XFLT to see higher income generation within their portfolio, it hurt preferred investments that are largely fixed-rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While XFLT has some fixed-rate borrowings, PFO is also leveraged, but all of its borrowings are floating-rate. They chose not to hedge their borrowings as other fund sponsors had. Looking back, that was clearly the wrong step, but hedging also comes with a cost. Had rates not been so aggressively hiked, it could have led to outperformance, as it had historically done for them not to be hedged.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So they saw their borrowing costs rise while the underlying fixed-rate yields stayed...well...fixed. They had some fixed-to-float exposure, but that primarily only helps over the longer term, as they can take years to kick in to the floating rate part—at which time, the issuer often calls it and replaces it if they can for a cheaper issuance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Needless to say, that meant less income leftover to support a distribution, and we saw many distribution cuts while rates were rising aggressively—as the portfolio also tanked lower, creating a double-whammy. However, the distribution has now been going back up. It has been a slow process, but the rate cuts have been a much slower process compared to the most aggressive rate hiking cycle we've seen in decades from the Fed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PFO Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PFO Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current distribution rate of 6.33% can be compared to the 5.91% NAV rate. The discount here isn't as substantial as XFLT, but any discount will help to 'juice' the market yield relative to the NAV rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the period of aggressive rate hikes, sending the payout lower along with a NAV heading lower, as the fund's share price was tanking into a deep discount. That exacerbated the actual pain that investors felt, as the fund had previously traded at a premium regularly. So that was more like a triple-whammy that investors got in this fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is, risk of investing in a CEF is that a discount/premium can work against you, as a discount can always move even wider—or, in this case, a premium drops to a material discount. Though even that discount has been starting to narrow now that rates have mostly stabilized and the Fed has once again begun to cut its benchmark rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has seen its discount narrow quite impressively since the double-digit levels, but it still remains historically attractive. Particularly on a short-term basis, we see an elevated 1-year z-score. With that, I wouldn't be adding too aggressively here, but once again, take a dollar-cost average approach.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's also worth noting that about 50% of the fund is invested in BBB or above credit quality, making it tilt toward a relatively higher quality portfolio that should pose relatively less credit risk. Instead, it is a more interest rate-sensitive fund, as we've touched on.</p>",

Surging AI adoption – resulting in the need for power-intensive data centers – is one of the most notable tailwinds to emerge in recent years. Rising global fragmentation, leading to renewed efforts to expand manufacturing capacity outside of China, is expected to boost industrial electricity consumption. Simultaneously, shifting demographics, climate change, and the electrification of transport and heat are driving power demand growth from consumer appliances and electric vehicles. These dynamics could create sizeable opportunities for companies involved in the electricity and grid infrastructure value chain.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6667\" data-height=\"3344\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_01-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"642\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaways</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Global electricity demand could grow by 13,300 terawatt hours (TWh) through 2040, which is nearly equivalent to the current electricity consumption of China and the United States combined.<sup>2</sup> </li> <li>Data centers are an increasingly significant driver of power demand growth. By 2035, global data center electricity use could rival the power needs of large economies.<sup>3,4</sup> </li> <li>Many utilities around the world will likely need to expand power generation and grid infrastructure assets, an undertaking that could require $15 trillion in investments through 2035.<sup>5</sup> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Power Industry Is Poised for a Dramatic Transformation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global electricity demand is forecast to skyrocket 50% by 2040.<sup>6</sup> This robust outlook largely stems from three key drivers: the ongoing buildout of power-intensive data centers, the electrification of heat and transport, and an anticipated expansion of manufacturing activity in major economies like the United States. At the same time, traditional electricity growth drivers, such as population growth and expanded air conditioning use, are expected to contribute to higher electricity use around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China is expected to remain the largest electricity consumer, with demand forecast to rise from 8,778TWh in 2024 to nearly 14,000TWh by 2040.<sup>7</sup> India’s electricity use could more than double from 1,617TWh to 3,474TWh over the same period. Although the United States is forecast to experience the third largest jump, its power market is undergoing a dramatic shift.<sup>8</sup> Over the next 15 years, U.S. electricity demand is forecast to increase between 35% and 50%, a substantial reversal from near-flat growth over the past 20 years.<sup>9,10</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Data Center Power Demand Could Grow More Than 4x Between 2024 and 2035</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data centers have emerged as a driving force of rising power demand forecasts around the world. A key reason behind this surge is the growing adoption of generative AI, as large language models often consume large amounts of electricity. For example, a single ChatGPT query can require roughly 10 times the energy of a typical Google search.<sup>11</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The three major economies driving the AI race are expected to account for the majority of global data center growth. The United States is forecast to remain the leading market, with demand projected to rise from 141TWh in 2024 to nearly 430TWh by 2035.<sup>12</sup> China could add just over 300TWh of electricity demand from data centers, while Europe could add nearly 100TWh.<sup>13</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globally, data center power demand is forecast to increase from 371TWh in 2024 to 1,596TWh in 2035.<sup>14</sup> This level would mean that within a decade, the global data center fleet could require more power than many large economies consumed in 2024, including Brazil, Japan, and Russia.<sup>15,16</sup> By 2035, data centers could account for 4.5% of global electricity use, up from a 1.4% share in 2024.<sup>17</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6667\" data-height=\"3975\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-3.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"763\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Modernizing Power Infrastructure Can Create a Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In many countries, growing electricity needs are compounding at a time when utilities also face mounting security risks from cyberattacks, shifting grid dynamics, and extreme weather. For example, in 2024, Hurricanes Milton and Helene created significant disruptions to power grid infrastructure in the Southeastern United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solving these challenges will likely require trillions of dollars in investments across a variety of power sources, including renewable energy, short- and long-term energy storage, nuclear power, and natural gas. Solar power, wind power, and battery energy storage are forecast to account for a combined 92% of global electricity capacity additions between 2025 and 2040.<sup>18 </sup>Tech advancements, cost-competitiveness, favorable policies, and corporate power purchases support the robust outlooks for the renewables industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forecasted capacity expansion for nuclear power is smaller, but it is likely to remain a vital solution, particularly for data center operators. Since 2024, the tech sector has emerged as a burgeoning market for traditional and next-gen nuclear power purchase agreements (PPAs).<sup>19</sup> In June 2025, for example, Constellation and Meta signed a 20-year PPA for the 1,121-megawatt (MW) Clinton nuclear power plant in Illinois to support Meta’s operations, beginning in 2027.<sup>20</sup> Also in June, Amazon and Talen Energy signed a 1,920MW PPA to use the utility’s Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to power Amazon Web Services' (AWS) data centers in the region.<sup>21</sup> Small modular reactor (SMR) developers, such as Oklo and NuScale, also signed agreements to supply power to data centers in the future.<sup>22,23</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In total, nearly $15 trillion in global investments could be required for electricity generation facilities and power grid infrastructure through 2035, with the largest investments expected for renewables and power grids.<sup>24 </sup>By 2050, total investment needs for power grids are projected to more than double.<sup>25</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6667\" data-height=\"3654\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_03-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"702\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Power Is Pivotal to the Modern Economy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The advancement of disruptive technologies, such as AI and electric vehicles, requires an unprecedented power capacity expansion. Meeting future power needs likely calls for large-scale deployment of available technology, including nuclear power, renewables, cutting-edge energy storage systems, and hydrogen-powered solutions. For investors, we believe this transformation of the global power network presents powerful, long-term opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Hostert, D., Kimmel, M., Berryman, I., Pegios, K., Quintero, R., Song, S., Verma, A., &amp; Vasdev, A.

Since then, the stock has surged 113%, reflecting growing conviction in its execution and financial strength. The company raised 2025 guidance<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to $82–$100 million, beat Q2 revenue by 15%, and secured a $1 billion investment from Susquehanna, boosting cash to $1.68 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ahead of Q3 2025 earnings next week, with revenue expected to rise over 117% year-over-year, IonQ’s focus shifts from proving technology to scaling commercialization through Oxford Ionics, Lightsynq, and early networking deployments that could define the next phase of quantum monetization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I maintain a hold rating, accumulating on pullbacks, recognizing IonQ’s technological leadership while noting that its extended valuation limits substantial upside in the near to medium term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding the Quantum Empire</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ posted a revenue of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809906-ionq-inc-ionq-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$20.7 million for the Q2 2025</a>, thus beating the estimate by a margin of 15%. This may be justified based on the acceleration of projects for the U.S. Department of Energy and Air Force Research Laboratory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The purchases of Oxford Ionics and Lightsynq fundamentally changed IonQ’s technological roadmap. Oxford Ionics brings ion-trapping on a chip that allows for the integration of millions of qubits with current silicon manufacturing, while Lightsynq provides photonic interconnects to connect these chips in modular group configurations to allow for the achievement of IonQ’s roadmap of 800 logical qubits in 2027 and <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/331/114331/original.pdf\">80,000 in 2030</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1868\" data-height=\"1048\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was addressed by Oxford Ionics’ co-founder, Chris Ballance, who pointed out that<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822690-ionq-inc-ionq-analyst-investor-day-transcript\"> 95% of the hardware overlaps</a> with IonQ’s existing designs, so there is immediate access to mature fabrication processes and ‘trillions in prior semiconductor R&amp;D,’ giving IonQ a substantial cost advantage, with IonQ’s expected logical qubit cost being one to two orders of magnitude lower than others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ, on the other hand, has expanded far beyond the realm of computation. The addition of the ID Quantique and Capella contracts has cemented IonQ’s place in not only computation but also in earth-based networks and satellite communications as well, as the only company with functioning technology in all three areas. The QKD solutions offered by IDQ are currently safeguarding information for world governments and financial institutions, while the satellites from Capella Technology Corporation will offer worldwide secure entanglements.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ Q3 2025 Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ is expected to announce third-quarter earnings for the year 2025 on November 5, projecting revenues of $26.99 million and EPS of -$0.44 compared to over 117% growth from the previous year during the same period. Notably contributing to the company’s excellent performance in Q2, where it beat Street estimates by posting revised <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809906-ionq-inc-ionq-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">full-year revenue estimates within the band of $82 to $100 million</a>, the company’s balance sheet remains strengthened at $1.68 billion in cash after receiving an equity investment of $1 billion from Susquehanna.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Momentum is expected to continue while IonQ converts the backlog related to contracts with the government, hyperscalers, and enterprises by integrating Oxford Ionics and Lightsynq to further advance the hardware roadmap. The company is targeting 800 logical qubits in 2027 and 80,000 in 2030 to scale through the company’s technology in semiconductor-based fabrication and photonic interconnects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company would be executing on backlog, Oxford Ionics integration, and early quantum networking revenue related to ID Quantique and Capella in Q3. Marginal expansion would continue due to increased investments in R&amp;D, yet IonQ has enough capital to make these investments without dilution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1054\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, IonQ is implementing an aggressive roadmap but in a position of strength in terms of finances. The company ended Q2 2025 with $656.8 million in cash, which <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/331/114331/original.pdf\">increased to $1.68 billion</a> after it received an equity investment of $1 billion from Susquehanna, which was priced at a 25% premium to the last close. The deal is the single biggest in the quantum industry, leaving IonQ debt-free and well-funded to 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses increased to $181 million in Q2, reflecting IonQ’s growth in R&amp;D investments and the integration of new subsidiaries. The company posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million, primarily due to a 231% increase in year-over-year spending on Research &amp; Development. The CFO left little doubt about his spending preferences with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822690-ionq-inc-ionq-analyst-investor-day-transcript\">$1.7 billion to spend</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it has significant losses in the near term, IonQ's model emphasizes capability compounding rather than spending management. The growing list of hybrid contracts and primitive production solutions portends well for IonQ to turn adjusted EBITDA positive in the current decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1888\" data-height=\"1040\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apps Shift from Research to Revenue</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One question investors always ask is when quantum computing becomes relevant to businesses. That question is being answered by IonQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The collaborative effort with AstraZeneca, Nvidia, and AWS has resulted in a<a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/331/114331/original.pdf\"> 20x speedup in drug discovery simulations</a>, thus establishing the real-world benefit. The other projects with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, General Dynamics, and Ansys seek to apply IonQ solutions to optimization problems in logistics and the efficiency of the energy grid, thereby establishing the real-world revenue from hybrid solutions today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The software stack at IonQ has transformed itself into a vital barrier to competition. What began with simple control of qubits has expanded to include an in-house OS, job scheduler, and chemistry/AI-specific repositories on top of it. The manner in which companies start with hybrid workloads and scale to full quantum has locked in revenue streams with strong SaaS-like characteristics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1892\" data-height=\"1052\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: The Quantum Premium</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At around $61 per share, IONQ commands an enterprise value of roughly $20.7 billion, translating to a forward EV/Sales multiple of 226.9x and a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2lvbnElMkNyZ3RpJTJDcWJ0cyUyQ3F1YnQ=\">Price/Sales ratio of 266x</a>, both far exceeding the sector median of around 3.6x. While traditional valuation ratios like P/E or EV/EBITDA remain meaningless in the quantum space, the premium highlights IonQ’s scarcity value and leadership position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to peers such as Rigetti (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGTI\" title=\"Rigetti Computing, Inc.\">RGTI</a>) (EV/Sales 1,519x) and D-Wave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QBTS\" title=\"D-Wave Quantum Inc.\">QBTS</a>) (445x), IonQ’s valuation, though steep, appears relatively moderate given its superior growth, institutional backing, and full-stack quantum integration spanning computing, networking, and space-based systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commercialization Timing Remains the Critical Variable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most significant risk to IonQ, however, is the delay in commercialization. IonQ can potentially offer fault-tolerant technology before 2030, but monetizing it would require validating sustained consumer demand and scalability beyond piloting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ has planned very aggressively, with goals for tens of millions of qubits and establishing quantum networks worldwide, and while integrating Oxford Ionics and Lightsynq seamlessly would allow it to expedite milestones, any delay in it can potentially reschedule them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High R&amp;D investments with negative operating cash flow can potentially dilute the equity if it spends more on R&amp;D with less expected revenue in the initial phase, even with the current cash reserve of $1.6 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current financial situation of IonQ is one of heavy investment and not of weakness. Its unique IP, sovereign relationships, and plan to deliver large-scale quantum solutions mean that IonQ is on the verge of transitioning from being a speculative innovation play to being a full-fledged platform play, where any kind of valuation multiple becomes absolutely irrelevant to the situation.</p>",

And this is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> largely justified as their demand has worsened thanks to competitive and macro pressures, two variables I vastly underestimated.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The go-forward question, however, remains: is this just a temporal deterioration that stabilizes, or a structural one that would then support their current price? I find the former more likely and correspondingly see various paths for outperformance, but I’m still not buying.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales: Share Loss Structural?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s the year-over-year financial summary: sales have gone from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10269868\">$602M</a> to $483M as their community absorption rate declined from 4.3x to 3x, more than offsetting their growth in communities from 128 to 146 (ASPs were roughly flat at $365K). Total closings declined from 1,655 to 1,323.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Included in those figures is a mix of both their Wholesale and Retail business. Parsed out, Wholesale closings actually grew year-over-year from 117 homes last year to 237 in Q2, with revenue correspondingly growing from ~$36M to ~$71M today. Retail, however, materially weighed on results - total closings declined from 1,538 to 1,086, with revenue declining from ~$566M to ~$412M. So, when we’re thinking about the sales decline, we’re really contextualizing the decline in their Retail business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging in, I think this decline reflects a mix of both market-related and competitive pressures. Management kicked off the Q2 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808972-lgi-homes-inc-lgih-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">call</a> noting that “elevated mortgage rates contributed to the affordability pressures weighing on entry-level buyers,” and that “heightened economic uncertainty has created a softer sales environment, which buyers are still exploring the idea of home ownership, but are taking longer to make decisions and, in some cases, choosing to delay their purchases.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of this seems to have some qualitative truth - i.e., it’s not inconceivable that consumers are deferring home purchases amid today’s economic climate. Indeed, from one angle, there has been a slight <a href=\"https://www.mba.org/news-and-research/newsroom/news/2025/05/13/mortgage-delinquencies-increase-slightly-in-the-first-quarter-of-2025\" rel=\"noopener\">uptick in FHA</a> mortgage delinquencies in 2025. Or, alternatively, PulteGroup (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHM\" title=\"PulteGroup, Inc.\">PHM</a>) has seen a single-digit decline in orders, citing that while “consumers remain engaged in the home buying process … they are proceeding with caution given concerns,” so industry conditions are not better, to say the least.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, when I zoom out on the landscape, we can see some of LGI’s competitors, like Meritage Homes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTH\" title=\"Meritage Homes Corporation\">MTH</a>) and Lennar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LEN\" title=\"Lennar Corporation\">LEN</a>) reporting roughly flat year-over-year orders and closings. Furthermore, rates are about the <a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">same</a>, so I don’t really buy this argument that they’ve lost a material number of customers for macro reasons. And we can see industry <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/new-home-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">data</a> showing a roughly similar demand level year-over-year for new home sales across the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, that’s not to say there’s some general market softness; however, there’s clearly a wide disconnect between the demand changes that LGI has seen and the rest of the industry. If, then, LGI’s demand reflected a change in market factors - e.g., interest rates, uncertainty - we’d see a similar demand impact on some of their competitors, but this clearly isn’t being reflected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is true that part of LGI’s absorption decline stems from a “one-time”-ish impact from the addition of new communities. That is, new communities tend to be, on average, less productive in their initial phases, so as they’ve increased the mix of these (from 128 last year to 146 today), that should have slightly reduced their absorption rate. However, we know this was only part of the degradation, as total closings were down despite more communities, implying their “existing” communities sold many fewer homes today than last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The only logical conclusion from this, then, is that they lost customers to some of their competitors, as evidenced by the referenced data above. And there seems to be a reasonable explanation: increased incentives by competitors. Let’s take Lennar as an example. In Q3 last year, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10496168#source=section%3Asummary%7Csection_asset%3Aall_news%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A3\">Lennar posted 22.5%</a> gross margins - today, those margins are 17.5%, and that’s not because costs grew. It’s because, as Lennar points out, they’ve increased their incentives offered. D.R. Horton (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DHI\" title=\"D.R. Horton, Inc.\">DHI</a>) too saw their gross margins decline ~200 bps to ~22%, with approximately half attributed to increased incentives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concurrently - and importantly - LGI has not really been increasing their incentives at the same rate. ASPs were just marginally higher year-over-year at ~$365K, and had it not been for increased Wholesale mix, the ASP would have actually been a little higher thanks to the “geographic mix” in the quarter. This trend reflects that (1) they’re not materially reducing listed pricing anywhere and (2) there’s no material pressure from previously reported trends of customers trending down to lower square footage homes that have a lower price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, they can keep prices unchanged but increase their incentives (COGS) offered. To this end, LGI’s adjusted gross margins are indeed down 150 bps year-over-year, and part of this does indeed stem from increased incentives, which they confirmed back at the start of the year and have noted on Q1 and Q2 calls. However, considering that part of the gross margin decline also came from increased Wholesale mix and operating deleverage, the increase in incentives could have conceivably only been something like 60-80 bps of that. So, compared to what we’ve seen from someone like Lennar, the improvement in their competitors’ value proposition seemingly exceeds LGI’s improvement, supporting this hypothesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inversely, there’s not really any other great explanation for the decline in demand year-over-year (materially speaking). One could suggest a share loss to apartments (a considered alternative by their customers), which I suppose has maybe some merit, but not that much. <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250707370880/en/Apartments.com-Releases-Multifamily-Rent-Growth-Report-for-Second-Quarter-of-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">CoStar released</a> data for Q2 2025 showing apartment rents nationally growing year-over-year in the first half of 2025 and in Q2 specifically, not necessarily something consistent with a structural shift to apartments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I’m largely at odds with management's take on what’s been driving the decline in Retail closings. They’ve been chalking it up to “affordability” or “market” degradation, but that simply doesn’t square away with the data I’m seeing. Share loss appears to be the better explanation as customers find more attractive prices from competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this is true, what do we make of absorption rates going forward? They’re guiding for ~1.2K closings in Q3 across 145 communities, or an absorption rate of ~2.75x. Typically, there’s some seasonally driven decline from Q2 here, so this isn’t terribly concerning, but clearly, their guidance reflects that today’s demand was not driven by some major one-time issue - this is a good reflection of current (weakened) demand conditions. And there also doesn’t appear to be any predicted, abnormal pressure from anticipated Wholesale closing declines. On a run rate basis, then, absorption rates appear to be about 2.8x-ish on an annual basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I think about where this could trend to, I envision a few different ends of the outcome range. On one end, it’s conceivable that competitors continue to price even lower (increase incentives) while LGI remains steadfast on maintaining their margin. This, however, doesn’t appear sustainable, as I believe LGI would ultimately reduce price to retain customers - they know their price elasticity better than I do, but at some point, the price reduction would be smaller than the cost savings from lower volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And indeed, they admitted on the Q2 call to “leaning” into more incentives lately, which would support this go-forward approach. Or said differently, they’re guiding for 24.5% adjusted gross margins in Q3, which would be 100 bps lower than the 25.5% reported in Q2. Their explanation on the call was that they “...always want more pace, leading to our discussion on gross margin, we're forecasting slightly lower gross margin because we are leaning into incentives, especially on the older aged inventory.” So, I find it reasonable that LGI starts to more closely match their competitors' incentive changes, thus reducing share loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, is it possible that the industry sustains a lower margin profile beyond today’s levels? It’s not inconceivable. Looking at Lennar again, we can see that their current high-teens gross margins are lower than their low-20% gross margins historically. And if we run some over-simplistic math on returns-on-tangible-capital, Lennar is posting sub-10% returns now, or average-to-below-average at this point. So, we’re clearly closer to the bottom range of sustainable rational outcomes, but I personally wouldn’t rule out an extended period - say, 2-3 years - of below-average margins across the industry. Things take time to turn, and the world doesn’t always operate rationally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we are at the bottom of the range, though, in terms of how far players will take their price, and we also assume that LGI will start matching incentives to a roughly similar magnitude, a long-term absorption rate of 3x would make sense to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The alternative end of the spectrum is pretty much just the inverse - prices return to historical averages as each company attempts to earn a reasonable return on capital (development costs), which would essentially drive a good chunk of demand back to LGI as they wouldn’t increase prices as much as competitors implicitly would. In the scenario, LGI could certainly be doing 4x+ absorption rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, there’s a final element here, which is just general market demand levels. At the moment, there appears to be some decent stability, or perhaps slightly worse conditions than last year. When I zoom out, however, we’re not in some abnormal, unsustainable demand territory that’s artificially propped up. That is, new home sales are about where they were pre-COVID, which more or less matches long-term historical averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where this goes from here, I don’t think anyone really knows. Per history, we could maintain stability around these levels, or we could see increased demand from external drivers (lower rates), or the opposite (higher rates). Sustainably speaking, however, I’m fine assuming some 10% bound around those absorption rates. That is, I think there’s a range of outcomes where LGI is doing 2.75x absorption rates over time and an outcome where they’re doing 4.5x. Layer on another 0.25x from new community rate maturity, and we’ll call it 3-4.75x. And in both scenarios, I don’t mind assuming 0-1% cost inflation to their current $365K ASP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, the biggest assumption I’m making is that the declines we’ve seen versus last year are not perpetual, but just stemming from a widened price gap. At some point, either (1) this stops, or (2) LGI increases incentives accordingly to maintain share before it stops. But I don’t find it sustainable long-term for the industry to price materially lower than they’re currently realizing, otherwise returns-on-capital would seemingly fall to uninvestable territory. And as far as new entrants and/or structural market changes, there are worthy items to consider, but none that I think materially change the long-term picture for LGI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final variable is their long-term community count. As referenced above, this grew quite a bit year-over-year, from 128 to 146, with LGI opening up new communities across all regions. My conclusion hasn’t really changed here - I still think there’s room for them to grow to 200+ over time, and their belief hasn’t really changed either, as they note that “[d]irectionally, it should be increasing.” In the meantime, though, their previously stated guidance for 160+ by year-end is not likely. Indeed, they’re guiding for 145 in Q3 with the pullback due to economic reasons (lower returns on capital).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And it’s true - historically, they’ve posted returns on equity of ~20%, but given the current demand conditions, those returns are closer to 8-10% on a run rate basis, or about average. So, there are two extremes here. On the one hand, they may ultimately decide that notwithstanding economics recovering to historical levels, they’d open new communities anyway and grow to, say, 200. The other extreme, however, which is more evidenced by recent moves, is that they materially curtail community growth and send those dollars back to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m personally assuming path 1 is more likely - i.e., they grow. Consistent with this model, they’re going to have to front about $1B+ in capital via inventory growth to support another ~50 communities. Of course, this varies depending on community size, but I expect that to remain relatively consistent with today’s profile. And it also depends on how much inventory they want to carry - as they noted on the call, they’ll be reducing inventory in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All considered, then, my model looks something like this. I have a community count of 200, from which I contextualize there to be two scenarios - one in which they post 3x absorption rates and another where they post 4.75x. With $390K as an ASP, sales would range from ~$2.8B to ~$4.4B.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins: Sales Dependent</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LGI’s adjusted gross margin declined 150 bps to 25.5%, and GAAP EBIT margin declined 300 bps to 8.2%. Management called out the gross margin decline on the call, citing “...higher percentage of wholesale closings and, to a lesser extent, higher lot costs and higher capitalized interest as a percentage of revenue as well as reduced operating leverage…”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The capitalized interest variable is excluded in adjusted gross margins, but the rest of the variables make sense - Wholesale was indeed higher and carries lower gross margins, and the reduced absorption rates result in less fixed cost leverage, although this is a smaller percentage of COGS as most of COGS is comprised of the individual home construction (variable costs). Also, it’s worth recalling that back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4779449-lgi-homes-inc-lgih-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q1</a>, they were seeing increased costs, although it’s possible these have yet to fully flow through yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I’ve discussed above, though, a good chunk - despite being unmentioned - of the gross margin decline likely had to do with increased incentives. That is, while ASPs are roughly unchanged, incentives - rate buydowns, closing costs - have increased, increasing their COGS relative to sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With respect to OPEX, this declined with G&amp;A relatively unchanged, while selling expenses declined from ~$53M to ~$41.6M. They cited “more efficient advertising spend” as the reason for the selling expense decline, which I tend to contextualize as just lower ad spend. It’s worth pointing out that for the first half of the year, advertising spend is actually “higher” despite lower sales, so increased “efficiency” seems moot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Qualitatively speaking, though, selling expenses should have had two mixed changes. For one, the increase in community count entails increased headcount - sales reps and managers - to support those communities. Countering this, however, was a decrease in the absorption rates/closings that reduced their sales commission expense. And this latter variable should have driven the bulk of the year-over-year selling expense decline, more than offsetting the headcount cost increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thinking about what this means going forward, I don’t find it to be all that complex, as sales are really going to be the driver of long-term margins, or more specifically, closings. Right now, the 8.2% EBIT margins translate into ~8%-ish on an annual run rate basis (Q2 is a decently average quarter per year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we think about scenario 1, where they earn ~$2.8B in sales, this entails an absorption rate roughly equal to today’s run rate and a higher community count. I’m assuming in this scenario, though, that competitors remain aggressive on incentives and that LGI would choose to more or less match them, but I’m not assuming it materially degrades beyond today’s conditions (a potentially perilous assumption). As I referenced above, adjusted gross margins are guided to 24.5% in Q3, reflecting LGI’s willingness to match competitive conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So relative to today, based on industry margins starting to encroach on the lower end of returns on capital, if we assume that they remain here long-term, this would translate into another 100 bps EBIT margin headwind. Layering on minimal additional operating leverage as my absorption rate estimate remains unchanged, and long-term EBIT margins would look like 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Scenario 2 would simply be a lot of the opposite. Absorption rate would return to 4x+ levels, implying that industry prices/margins improve and that LGI would be able to retain at least their current gross margins. Layer on, then, the additional operating leverage per community, and that would probably translate into a margin closer to 10%, more consistent with their history when absorption rates were much higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I touched on this earlier, but two capital allocation paths could unfold - they can acquire inventory to grow communities, or send FCF back to shareholders. I’m assuming they’ll invest in inventory to support future community growth as noted earlier (to what I think will be ~$1B+).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I’ll just reiterate what I’ve noted in prior articles, which is that they don’t *have* to acquire all new inventory. That is, they’re running inventory at ~185% of sales, a level that is far higher than they justifiably need (the delta is management reportedly finding attractive prices). Thus, it could be that community growth to the 200 mark entails using a mix of already purchased inventory and newly acquired inventory, which would materially change the cash flows (and thus, IRR). For conservatism's sake, I’m assuming inventory remains at these levels and shareholders don’t get this benefit yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put together, here’s how I’m contextualizing the prospective IRR. In one scenario, I think LGI could be doing sales and EBIT of $2.8B/$197M over time (FY35). If that’s realized and remains at a structural, sustainable level, investors would earn something like a 7-8% IRR. On the other hand, if reality is the second scenario ($4.4B/$445M), I calculate an IRR closer to 12-13%. (For more specifics, I’m taking their EBIT, subtracting tax, capex, and their inventory investment along the way to calculate the go-forward free cash flow.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Does this make for an attractive bet? Well, it depends on your opportunity cost. But from an absolute return perspective, it’s an okay return per what I’d deem a reasonable range of outcomes. Again, the key assumption that I’m making is that LGI is not structurally broken such that they’re a perpetual share loser. And the other key assumption that I’m making is that the housing market or competitive conditions don’t collapse in 2-5 years, neither of which are certain, and this frankly scares me from an investment perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is an important one. If, for whatever reason, the industry sees prolonged demand reductions and/or prolonged pricing irrationality, that could easily knock a good 100-200 bps off an investor’s return. And that's not considering other random variables such as tariffs. On the other hand, though, there is the conceivable scenario that they materially reduce inventory to lower (sustainable) levels and that materially adds to the IRR in this event.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having purchased LGI at materially higher levels, there’s this psychological urge to assume that (1) since I don’t believe the business is broken and (2) conditions are worse off today than they were then, (3) the IRR must be attractive today. And in some scenarios, I think LGI will outperform from today—and materially—but it’s not obvious that’ll be the realized scenario. For that reason and given other investments out there, LGI will remain just a tiny percentage of my portfolio.</p>",

Thermal companies normally cash flow rather generously on their own without big news like this. Still, if anyone was wondering where the cash was coming from to finance the MEG Energy (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGEF\" title=\"MEG Energy Corp.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">OTCPK:MEGEF</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) acquisition (where the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4512300-meg-energy-meeting-on-cenovus-deal-postponed-another-week\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">vote was delayed</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> one more time), the answer is a very unusual \"the company raised the cash all by itself\". There is a whole lot going on here, and it all appears to be positive for shareholders. The company may still borrow money to finance the acquisition. But it is also quite capable of raising whatever cash is needed.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828616-cenovus-ups-the-ante-for-meg-energy\">last article</a> mentioned that the final offer for MEG Energy was raised a little bit, which got Strathcona (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STHRF\" title=\"Strathcona Resources Ltd.\">OTCPK:STHRF</a>) to vote its shares in favor of the acquisition. But a regulatory inquiry forced a postponement of the vote for another week until next week. That postponement allowed the sale of the refineries to close and the company to report a flood of incoming cash (as in billions of cash).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, earnings went way past positive. Management has long been working with a group of acquired assets to get those assets running in an optimal fashion. This company has long been known for its low-cost upstream operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the acquired refineries were another matter entirely. Those refineries needed a lot of work. Now that work seems to be bearing some fruit that investors can actually see.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Note: Cenovus is a Canadian company that reports using Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cenovus Energy Summary Of Quarterly Financial Results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"273\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cenovus Energy Summary Of Quarterly Financial Results (Cenovus Energy Earnings Press Release October 31, 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The huge jump in earnings translated into one of the largest free cash flow funds reported in recent memory. Now much of the excess funds went to buying back stock because, as management reported, nearly C$1 billion in shares were repurchased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has delayed a return of the net debt back to the net debt target yet again. But it is also a sign of the fact that this investment grade company considers that debt well within easy handling range. But it also means that the stock price represents such value that it is worth deferring the debt goal for a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once the acquisition of MEG Energy closes, there could well be some more noncore sales of assets to quickly keep the net debt measurement within an allowable range (or long-term goal range). This company has long been known for making acquisitions and quickly fixing the balance sheet to where it wants it to be. This coming acquisition should be no exception.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Refining</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, steady progress is being made with the refining system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cenovus Energy Summary Of Refining Progress\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cenovus Energy Summary Of Refining Progress (Cenovus Energy Corporate Earnings Presentation Third Quarter 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, management has been working on the acquired refining system probably ever since the acquisition some years back. However, the improvement projects are now getting to the point where the progress shown above is getting to the point where results are becoming apparent to investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understand that just the acquisition of refining capacity allows this company to report that significant amounts of production bypass the issues with selling a discounted product on the open market. That issue has long plagued company results (and held back the stock price as a result).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there was clearly more money to be made by optimizing the acquired refining system. Unfortunately, progress is relatively slow at one turnaround project at a time. I have covered some of this in the past because only the larger, more significant projects really had any effect on results. But now, the cumulative effects of all the improvements made are becoming apparent, as shown above. There is likely more progress coming in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would expect that the MEG Energy acquisition would raise the priority for still more refining capacity through construction of that capacity or by yet another acquisition when a suitable deal presents itself.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Throughput</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company is not afraid to hold back production when market conditions are less than optimal. One of the contributors to the big quarter was a whole lot of production, as shown below. Now this rather favorable quarter is going to make for a tough comparison next year. Fortunately, that is not yet on the market's radar. Even when it does get to be a market consideration, the MEG Energy acquisition will likely help comparisons by the time this quarter arrives next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cenovus Energy Third Quarter Throughput Summary Comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"181\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cenovus Energy Third Quarter Throughput Summary Comparison (Cenovus Energy Earnings Press Release Third Quarter 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sale of the refinery interests netted C$1.8 billion on October 1. This and the decision to increase the number of shares offered to roughly 50% of the total offer to acquire MEG Energy may make this one of the more conservative deals I have covered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile management continues to both grow production and improve the operations of the assets managed. A combination of decisions resulted in a quarter with a lot of free cash flow just when it was needed. This is an understated characteristic of above average management. The cash arrived at just the right time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cenovus Energy continues to be a strong buy idea as the now much larger company begins a transition from a growth story towards a growth and income story. Opportunistic acquisitions and sales will continue to be a material part of the company's future. That may well mean that the average return of these shares is likely to be in the mid-teens over the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The oil and gas industry continues to be largely out of favor in the current market. So, there could be some recovery potential that would result in a higher valuation in the future for the same results currently posted.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a regulatory inquiry that has delayed the meeting on the approval of the acquisition of MEG Energy. That regulatory inquiry could potentially derail the whole acquisition idea, or it could make the acquisition more costly than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company continues to benefit from advancing technology that has improved many of the deals made over time. Technological advances can theoretically stop at any time. There are no guarantees or assurances that technology will continue to advance to provide cost savings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future commodity prices are volatile and have low visibility. A severe and sustained downturn of those prices could materially change the future of the company.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

However, even Molina's marketplace plans were not immune to rising costs, as plans purchased through state exchanges had a medical cost ratio of 95.6%, significantly higher than expected, according to the CEO.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>ACA issues loom</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rate issues are not limited to Medicaid, as UnitedHealth joined a growing chorus of insurers expecting to be affected by changes in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ACA plans, which are offered through state-based marketplaces and directly from insurers rather than through an employer, have been under scrutiny as the extension of tax credits to lower plan costs has become a key issue for the ongoing federal government shutdown. While the issue remains unresolved, most insurers have already priced in the expectation that the tax credits will not be extended.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">UnitedHealth's insurance arm submitted rate filings in nearly all of the 30 states where it offers ACA plans, reflecting an average rate increase of over 25%, according to Noel. Consequently, the company expects its ACA membership to drop significantly, Noel said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Where we are unable to reach agreement on sustainable rates, we are enacting targeted service area reductions,\" Noel said. \"We believe these actions will establish a sustainable premium base while likely reducing our ACA enrollment by approximately two-thirds.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite these challenges, analysts at J.P. Morgan ranked the insurer's stock \"overweight,\" noting that the company expects to expand margins in 2026 through improvements in Medicare Advantage and commercial plans, which will offset the expected margin contraction in Medicaid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"We see this as not necessarily dissimilar from commentary in the second quarter; however, with the benefit of several more months of claims/trend progression, we think the incremental visibility underlines this positive commentary,\" the analysts wrote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ACA rate repricing may prove to be a more significant challenge for Centene Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNC\" title=\"Centene Corporation\">CNC</a>), which has a disproportionately large number of members in the plans compared to its similarly sized competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During a third quarter earnings call, Centene CEO Sarah London touted the benefits of extending ACA tax credits and said Centene believes \"these tax credits offer critical support for hard-working Americans, small business owners, and rural healthcare infrastructure.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Centene received a \"neutral\" rating from J.P. Morgan, and analysts cautioned about ongoing cost impacts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"On balance, we continue to view Centene an execution story with wide error bars in 2026, albeit one showing progress on execution, and we expect much of the focus will be on proving out assumptions and how Centene is able to recover ACA Exchange margins in 2026, with both factors needing to see further progress before investors turn more constructive,\" the analysts wrote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/10/us-health-insurer-shares-stumble-after-q3-earnings-as-cost-pressures-mount-94468495\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

My 2025 pick was Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>): I believed<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the market had overestimated the threats to Google’s search businesses by AI and antitrust.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time, Alphabet was trading at a P/E ratio of 17, compared to the S&amp;P average of 24. For Alphabet, these “existential” threats were akin to being trapped inside a speeding car with a wasp - potentially serious, in the moment, but in hindsight, more of a nuisance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Google’s search share <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\" rel=\"noopener\">remains around 90%</a>, and the company is integrating AI into its results. Google, not OpenAI, will likely continue to monopolize search.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of monopoly, Alphabet lost its search and advertising lawsuits, but the remedy/punishment it was given was the equivalent of me threatening (again) to take my son’s phone away (i.e., meaningless). By the way, Alphabet is up 61% year over year, second only to Tesla in the Magnificent 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stock of 2026</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the market overestimated Alphabet’s existential threats, I believe it’s underestimating Amazon’s (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) not-so-secret weapon (automation) and missing its next growth engine (retail). For more than a decade, people thought of Amazon as a cloud company with a retail unit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS and the ad business drove its margin expansion, while on the retail side, fulfillment and shipping costs increased faster than sales. Two years ago, Amazon began to reverse that trend. Investments in automation, primarily robotics but also AI, are beginning to deliver operational leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon is projected to have almost <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-testing-new-warehouse-robots-and-ai-tools-for-workers-8e3d885a?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">40 delivery fulfillment centers</a> equipped with robots by the end of next year, resulting in an estimated cost savings of $4 billion per year. A <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-robots-the-10-billion-cost-cutters-170059181.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morgan Stanley report</a> estimated that if 30% to 40% of Amazon’s orders in the U.S. are fulfilled through its next-gen warehouses by 2030, the company could save $10 billion a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on last year’s financials, $10 billion in cost savings translates to an additional $170 billion in enterprise value. As the <em>Prof G Markets</em> team observed in our other newsletter, investors are “pricing in AWS’s dominance, but missing the retail margin story,” making Amazon one of the most underappreciated members of the Mag 7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon’s shares are trading at 34x earnings, well below the company’s five-year average of 60x. The stock had been up around 2% so far this year, but it popped after this week’s earnings call on news that AWS revenue had beaten expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon shipping costs vs retail revenue\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Atoms &amp; Bits</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of technology’s tectonic unlocks has been the elevation of information (bits) over objects (atoms). Our digital lives are (mostly) frictionless. One-click purchasing, personalized algorithmic feeds, and swiping right put shopping, entertainment, and mating at our fingertips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in the physical world, friction is the defining feature. To fulfill a one-click purchase, Amazon deploys armies of human workers, leveraging machines, global supply chains, and infrastructure. Five companies in the Mag 7 primarily move bits. One, Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>), moves atoms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Straddling both worlds, Amazon is a logistics company at its core. With <a href=\"https://maxdispatchservice.com/amazon-fleet-stats/#:~:text=Amazon%20owns%20approximately%2040%2C000%20semi,30%2C000%20branded%20delivery%20vans%20worldwide.\" rel=\"nofollow\">40,000 semitrucks</a>, 30,000 vans, and 110 aircraft (equivalent to the <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/largest-air-forces-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">armed forces</a> of Austria, Denmark, or Norway), Amazon excels at moving atoms. The company delivers <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/amazon-says-60percent-of-prime-orders-are-arriving-same-day-or-next-day.html#:~:text=This%20is%20up%20from%20roughly%2050%25%20in,selection%20of%20top%2Dselling%20items%20in%20each%20city.\" rel=\"nofollow\">60% of Prime orders</a> on the same or next day. According to the most recent data, almost three-quarters of Americans live within one hour of an Amazon fulfillment center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, I wrote that America’s economy is one big bet on AI. That bet has inflated the valuations of companies that move bits and distracted attention from companies using automation to reduce friction in the physical world. <a href=\"https://public.com/stocks/amzn\" rel=\"noopener\">Two-thirds of Amazon’s revenue</a> comes from three segments: online retail, physical stores, and fulfillment services for third-party sellers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those business lines account for one-third of Amazon’s operating expenses - $26 billion in the last quarter alone. The more it automates, the more Amazon can cut costs in its core business by reducing real-world friction. It’s already happening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-warehouse-robots-automation-942b814f?&amp;mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Amazon averaged roughly 670 employees per facility last year - the lowest number in 16 years. Meanwhile, those employees now handle 22x as many packages, on average, as they did a decade ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon employees per facility\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1 Million Robots (and Counting)</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This week, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced plans</a> to lay off 30,000 corporate employees. That 10% reduction represents the largest cut to headcount in the company’s history, but it’s a fraction of what’s coming for warehouse workers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon’s U.S. workforce has increased 3x since 2018, to almost 1.2 million (70% of the company’s employees are based in the U.S.). But according to the <em>New York Times</em>, Amazon believes that by 2027 it can avoid hiring more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html#:~:text=Amazon%27s%20U.S.%20work%20force%20has,packs%20and%20delivers%20to%20customers.\" rel=\"nofollow\">160,000 worker</a>s it would otherwise need in America. Ultimately, Amazon believes it can automate up to 75% of the company’s warehouse operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider Amazon’s most recent automation milestone. In June, it deployed its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/amazon-deploys-its-1-millionth-robot-in-a-sign-of-more-job-automation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">millionth robot worker</a>, putting the company on pace to have more robots than humans in its warehouses by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that, just as Mark Zuckerberg, Satya Nadella, and Sundar Pichai dream of AI replacing high-priced tech talent at Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Alphabet, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dreams of a robot workforce that will never unionize, get injured, demand a raise, go to the bathroom, take time off, or post about poor working conditions on social media.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Amazon’s scale, it’s not a robot workforce, but a robot nation. One of the fears about AI is that it could build a robot army that turns on us. It’s here, it’s Amazon, and (so far) it’s not looking to kill us. It will replace a lot of us, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Operational industrial robots\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Convergence </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon began investing in robotics a decade ago, purchasing Kiva Systems for $775 million. Since then, Amazon has identified <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/amazon-robotics-automation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">six categories of automation</a>: movement, manipulation, sorting, storage, identification and packing. A robot called Hercules moves heavy carts, while another, Pegasus, sorts and shuttles packed orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A robotic arm called Sparrow, designed to replace human pickers, is capable of handling 200 million different products of varying sizes and weights. A new address labeler can label 3,000 packages per hour. In tests, Amazon says Sequoia, an automated inventory management system, can process packages 25% faster than its current management system at a quarter of the cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, Amazon plans to spend $100 billion to capture what Jassy called a “once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity,” adding that “the vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS.” But investments in AI are paying dividends in robotics as the technologies converge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a Citigroup <a href=\"https://ir.citi.com/gps/H558-XNr_iTlGa7Qq7H9AYb5ZT2W851WZdFgPNEDsBtSeTgp7JcaTdS_uBfLVLpwfMQYeB5O5TwV9YcIDGuGOMjE2luzQprf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report put it</a>, “AI is a huge upgrade to robotics,” allowing robots to see, move, talk, learn, and act. It’s the difference between a robot programmed to perform a task and one capable of doing any task within its physical constraints. If you’ve taken a Waymo, you’ve seen convergence firsthand — the car is a robot operated by an AI driver. At Amazon, the peanut-butter-and-chocolate combo of AI and robotics shows up in three ways:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>New products:</strong> Amazon is testing AI-enhanced robots that can cut open boxes, unpack the contents, and sort them into the correct bins.</li> <li> <strong>Faster development:</strong> Amazon deployed its newest robotic arm, Blue Jay, 3x faster than its predecessors by using AI to make virtual prototypes.</li> <li> <strong>Optimization:</strong> DeepFleet uses AI to coordinate the movement of robots across Amazon’s fulfillment network, improving robot fleet travel time by 10%.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Holy Unlock</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other jobs, loading and unloading trucks is primarily done by humans even in the most automated warehouses. It’s the same story for last-mile delivery; Amazon’s goal is to deliver <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/amazon-resumes-drone-deliveries-after-two-month-pause.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">500 million packages</a> per year via drone by the end of the decade, but for now it relies on humans to deliver more than 6 billion packages annually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is dangerous work, akin to playing <em>Tetris</em> with heavy weights, often in extreme heat or freezing cold. According to <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106413.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLS data</a>, transportation and warehouse workers sustain serious injuries at twice the rate of manufacturing workers and nearly 4x the rate of workers in mining, oil, and gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last year, Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, described the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-new-robotic-warehouse-will-rely-heavily-on-human-workers-f95e06b6?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">tactile skills</a> and situational awareness needed to load and unload a truck as the “holy grail of robotics,” adding, “we aren’t there yet.” <em>We</em> is the operative word.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, DHL ordered <a href=\"https://www.therobotreport.com/dhl-buying-1000-stretch-robots-from-boston-dynamics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1,000 robot truck loaders</a> from Boston Dynamics. Through its $1 billion Industrial Innovation Fund, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/rightbot-which-is-developing-robots-to-unload-freight-lands-investment-from-amazon/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon invested in Rightbot</a>, a startup that designs robot truck loaders. As soon as a robot truck loader comes online, it’ll connect with two other robot systems - Cardinal and Proteus - that sort packages and move them to the loading dock. When that happens, some of America’s most dangerous jobs will (mostly) vanish.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Robots vs. Humans</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automation represents a massive wealth transfer from Amazon’s workers to its shareholders and customers.

I applauded the business for being a strong long-term performer, having found a solid balance between organic and inorganic growth, all combined<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> with solid long-term capital allocation skills.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following long-term gains seen by investors, valuation multiples have been on the increase as well, and the resulting earnings multiple in the low-thirties was a bit demanding, even as the long-term performance has been impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast-forwarding half a year in time, shares trade rather flattish; in fact, they have been trading down a percent or two, while the market at large has seen double-digit share price gains.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solving For Safer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Motorola Solutions develops, builds, and creates technologies that allow for the protection of people, property, and places. Spun-off from Motorola in 2011, the company became a pure play on providing such solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such technologies are, for instance, applied to video security, access controls, but also LMR communications and command centers. Applications in video security include fixed video security, in-car videos, body cameras. LMR is the definition of land mobile communications, in which Motorola provides such solutions for both public and private communication applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Command center applications include, for instance, 911 call center equipment. The extent of all these products is vast, including over 5 million fixed video cameras deployed, some 13,000 LMR networks installed, and over 3,600 911 call centers equipped with Motorola's equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates about $11 billion in annual sales, with some $7 billion in revenues stemming from products &amp; systems, complemented by software &amp; service, the latter being largely recurring revenues. In terms of segments, nearly $2 billion in sales are coming from video security, about $8 billion from mission-critical networks, and nearly a billion from command center revenues. About 70% of sales are tied to public safety and the remainder to enterprise clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company claims to target more than $80 billion in total addressable markets, as the business has seen strong growth in recent years. Over the past decade, revenues have essentially doubled to nearly $11 billion in 2024, with non-GAAP operating margins rising no less than 10 points towards 30% of sales, aided by the faster growing software revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that organic growth was combined with dozens of acquisitions over this period of time, coming at a combined purchase price in excess of $10 billion. Moreover, Motorola managed to buy back about one in every six shares over this period of time as well, with sales growth, margin expansion, and buybacks all helping to drive earnings per share growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this pushed up shares in a huge fashion, as well as a $70 stock in 2015 that peaked around the $500 mark in 2024, and after a period of relative stagnation this year, shares are down to $410 at this point in time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Perspectives</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Motorola reported an 8% increase in 2024 sales to $10.8 billion, with adjusted operating margins rising by a point to 29% of sales, allowing adjusted earnings to rise by some 16% to $13.84 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt of $4 billion just exceeded a $3.5 billion reported EBITDA number, yet a stock trading in the low $400s was trading around 30 times earnings. However, if one strips out stock-based compensation expenses, earnings trended closer to $12.50 per share, pushing up realistic earnings multiples towards 33 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company guided for 2025 sales to rise by some 5.5%, with adjusted earnings seen at a midpoint of $14.69 per share. Following a solid first quarter earnings report, Motorola announced a larger deal in May. Motorola reached a $4.4 billion deal to acquire LA-based Silvus Technologies, a transaction set to double net debt to $9 billion. With this deal, the company would acquire mobile ad-hoc technology, known as MANET, used for secure communication that no longer needs fixed networks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valued at 10 times sales, while Motorola traded around 7 times, the deal was expensive. However, the EBITDA margins of Silvus were reported some 13 points higher than Motorola, at around 45% of sales. With leverage ratios seen up to the mid-2s, and realistic earnings seen up to $13.00-$13.50 per share this year, multiples were still demanding in the low thirties, too high to see appeal for me here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Motorola closed the deal with Silvus in August, which meant that the acquisition made a partial contribution to the third quarter results, released by the end of October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third quarter reported sales <a href=\"https://www.motorolasolutions.com/content/dam/msi/investors/doc_financials/2025/q3/msi_q3_2025_earnings_release_and_financial_tables.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by 8% to $3.01 billion, with product sales up 6% and software &amp; services sales up 11%. Adjusted margins rose by nearly another point to exceed 30% of sales here, with adjusted earnings up 9% to $4.06 per share. The backlog is up 3% on an annual basis to $14.6 billion, as growth in the backlog has been trailing reported revenue growth for a while now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt is reported at $8.5 billion, a bit lower than the pro forma numbers in May, driven by retained earnings, as leverage is not a major concern with leverage ratios in the mid-2s; in fact, these are down to 2.3 times based on trailing EBITDA reported here. Aided by a full contribution from Silvus in the fourth quarter, revenues are seen up 11% on the year in the final quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The midpoint of the full year adjusted earnings guidance is now set at $15.12, up fifteen cents from the previous guidance. With stock-based compensation expenses trending around $1.70 per share, realistic earnings are only seen around $13.50 per share, resulting in a 30 times realistic earnings multiple seen this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares fell some 5% on the back of these results, as they hit a high in the high $400s in recent weeks, as the market is not impressed by the guidance, also as the company trades at very demanding multiples here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With organic growth trending in the mid-single digits here, the bar is high in terms of expectations. Frankly, this has been casting a shadow over the shares so far this year, as I see no appeal here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company continues to grow along just fine, and I like the bolt-on M&amp;A performed, I am hard-pressed to see appeal here, making me still very cautious to get involved with the shares here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares remain a bit too pricey, even if appeal might be on the increase, as I look forward to continuing to update the thesis following continued share price stagnation and/or interesting buybacks.</p>",
