The S&amp;P 500 Index increased 2.7% during the quarter, bringing full-year returns to 17.9%. Performance was shaped by the evolving monetary policy backdrop following the Federal Reserve's (\"Fed\") initial rate cut in September, with additional cuts in October and December, as investors balanced expectations for a gradual easing cycle against evidence of slowing, but still resilient economic fundamentals. The Fed maintained its data-dependent messaging throughout the quarter, signaling willingness to ease further as inflation continued moderating toward its target while labor market conditions softened at the margin. This approach helped contain interest rate volatility and provided support for equity valuations.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Corporate earnings remained broadly positive despite moderating growth rates. Forward guidance pointed to continued, albeit more measured, profit expansion into 2026. AI and technology-related sectors continued to drive earnings leadership, though contributions broadened to include Health Care, Industrials, and Consumer Discretionary stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mid-cap stocks lagged both large- and small-cap stocks. The Russell 1000® Index was up 2.4%, and the Russell 2000® returned 2.2%, while the Russell Midcap® Index was up just 0.2%. Value stocks – as measured by the Russell Indexes – outperformed growth stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nine of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors posted positive returns in the fourth quarter. Sector leadership was concentrated in the Health Care and Communication Services sectors, while Real Estate and Utilities lagged.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the fourth quarter, the Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund (Institutional Class, \"Fund\") returned 4.07%, outperforming its benchmark, the Russell Midcap® Value Index, which returned 1.42%. Among mid-caps, value stocks outperformed growth stocks, as the Russell Midcap® Growth Index returned -3.7%. The outperformance of value stocks had a positive impact on relative results given our value discipline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We take limited sector and industry bets and look to add value primarily from bottom-up stock selection. During the fourth quarter, stock selection accounted for most of the value added, however, sector selection was also positive. From a sector perspective, the Fund's underweight to Utilities and Real Estate added value. Stock selection added value in several sectors, particularly Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors &amp; Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following strong performance in the third quarter, Information Technology holding Sandisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) significantly outperformed again in the fourth quarter. AI-driven demand for storage led to strong earnings and increases in revenue growth and margins. We trimmed our position in Sandisk given the run-up in the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other top-performing holdings were in the Consumer Discretionary sector – General Motors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>) and Expedia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE\" title=\"Expedia Group, Inc.\">EXPE</a>). General Motors performed well after posting strong full-year results driven by record truck sales. The company continues to return capital to investors through stock buybacks and dividend increases. Expedia, which was a recent purchase, also posted strong results and raised the outlook going forward. We added to our exposure to Expedia and continue to hold both stocks in the Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jazz Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAZZ\" title=\"Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc\">JAZZ</a>), in the Health Care sector, was a top performer, advancing nearly 30% driven by strong third quarter performance and positive clinical trial results for one of its cancer drugs. We continue to hold the company in the Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other top contributors included underweights to momentum-based stocks that are in the benchmark, Robinhood Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOOD\" title=\"Robinhood Markets, Inc.\">HOOD</a>) and Coinbase Global (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While several Fund holdings struggled – including NewMarket (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEU\" title=\"NewMarket Corporation\">NEU</a>) in the Materials sector, HP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ\" title=\"HP Inc.\">HPQ</a>) in the Information Technology sector, and Harley-Davidson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOG\" title=\"Harley-Davidson, Inc.\">HOG</a>) and PulteGroup (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHM\" title=\"PulteGroup, Inc.\">PHM</a>) in the Consumer Discretionary sector – the most significant detractor was our underweight to Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>), which is in the benchmark and was up nearly 50% on acquisition activity. NewMarket struggled with general weakness in the petroleum additives business, one of the larger portions of its revenue. We continue to hold the stock in the Fund. Harley-Davidson struggled after reporting sharp declines in motorcycle revenue, increased costs, and pricing pressure. We continue to hold Harley-Davidson in the Fund. PulteGroup, in the homebuilding industry, struggled due to slowing orders and margin pressures despite a slight decrease in mortgage rates. We continue to hold PulteGroup in the Fund. HP has not benefited much from the AI frenzy like other technology companies. The company has seen rising costs and projected lower-than-expected earnings for 2026. We did not make any changes to our position in HP and continue to hold the stock in the Fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buys &amp; Sells</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We initiated a position in Garrett Motion (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTX\" title=\"Garrett Motion Inc.\">GTX</a>), an automotive parts and equipment company in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The company designs, manufactures, and sells turbocharger and electric boosting technologies for commercial vehicles. Garrett ranks high on multiple cash flow and forecast earnings measures on our model. The company typically pays a dividend and has been aggressively buying back stock, which we view positively. Price momentum during the past 12 months has been strong as has operating momentum, placing its momentum scores near the top decile. Overall, the stock ranks in the top 5% in our stock-ranking universe, which led to the fourth quarter purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also initiated a position in EnerSys (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENS\" title=\"EnerSys\">ENS</a>) in the Industrials sector. EnerSys designs, manufactures, and distributes energy systems and batteries to customers worldwide. The stock ranks high on multiple cash flow and forecast earnings measure — our two most important blocks of valuation. The company typically pays a dividend and has been aggressively buying back stock, which we view positively. Price momentum over the past 12 months has been strong. In addition, several indicators of operating momentum are also attractive, with improving operating margins and growth in sales. Overall, the stock ranks in the top 5% in our stock-ranking universe, which led to the fourth quarter purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We sold our position in Electronic Arts (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EA\" title=\"Electronic Arts Inc.\">EA</a>) in the Communication Services sector. Electronic Arts did well in 2025, advancing approximately 40% for the year. In late September, the company announced an agreement to be acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SVLKF\" title=\"Silver Lake Resources Limited\">SVLKF</a>), and Affinity Partners for $55 billion. The Fund often benefits from takeovers, as the companies we hold tend to be attractively priced, solid businesses that are undervalued, as was the case with Electronic Arts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We trimmed our position in Amkor Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMKR\" title=\"Amkor Technology, Inc.\">AMKR</a>) in the Information Technology sector. Amkor has done well in recent years, benefiting from the surging demand in AI and as a result has become less attractive from a valuation standpoint. While the stock still generates good cash flow, both earnings and cash flow have not kept up with the increase in stock price. Stock price momentum has been very strong but the decline in fundamentals (valuation) led us to sell the position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Underweights and Overweights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund's sector exposures are driven by valuations, as we will overweight those sectors where we find the most attractive stocks from a valuation standpoint and underweight those sectors and industries where we have difficulty finding cheap stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund's most significant overweights relative to the value benchmark are to the Consumer Discretionary and Financials sectors. Within the Consumer Discretionary sector, the Fund is overweight homebuilders, automotive parts, automotive retail, and broadline retail. Among Financials, the Fund is overweight consumer finance, commercial &amp; residential mortgage finance, asset management &amp; custody banks, regional banks, and property &amp; casualty insurance. The most significant underweights relative to the value benchmark are to Industrials, Materials, Utilities, and Real Estate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. equity markets finished the year strong; however, mid-cap stocks were only slightly positive in the fourth quarter and up just over 10% for the year compared to nearly 18% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Markets in 2025 were led by almost anything AI-related, driving up valuations for chipmakers and software firms building AI platforms. While technology-related stocks saw the largest gains, other sectors of the market also benefited from the broadening of the market advance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though AI-related technology stocks may appear priced to perfection, we continue to identify opportunities among mid- and smaller-capitalization value stocks. The Fund has outperformed the value benchmark in four of the past five years, with the only exception being 2024, when the Fund matched the return of the value benchmark. Even with strong relative performance, the Fund remains attractively priced relative to the benchmark. The Fund seeks to hold high-quality, profitable companies that generate cash, pay dividends, and repurchase shares. While large-cap U.S. stocks appear quite expensive, the mid- and small-cap segments of the market continue to trade at attractive multiples, particularly value-oriented stocks. We remain committed to our disciplined value investment approach and are excited about the opportunities available to investors among mid- and small-cap value stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Top 10 Holdings - As of 12/31/2025</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th>Portfolio %</th> <th>Benchmark 1 %</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>State Street Corporation</td> <td>1.84</td> <td>0.38</td> </tr> <tr> <td>General Motors Company</td> <td>1.58</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fox Corporation Class A</td> <td>1.47</td> <td>0.16</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Textron Inc.</td> <td>1.39</td> <td>0.16</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bank of New York Mellon</td> <td>1.37</td> <td>0.79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sandisk Corporation</td> <td>1.31</td> <td>0.34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jazz Pharmaceuticals Public</td> <td>1.31</td> <td>0.10</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Kroger Co.</td> <td>1.30</td> <td>0.40</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Citizens Financial Group</td> <td>1.27</td> <td>0.26</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PulteGroup Inc.</td> <td>1.26</td> <td>0.24</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total</strong></td> <td><strong>14.11</strong></td> <td><strong>2.83</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly Attribution - As of 12/31/2025</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Best &amp;

Stock markets are volatile and equity values can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market and economic conditions. The value of securities selected using quantitative analysis can react differently to issuer, political, market, and economic developments than the market as a whole or securities selected using only fundamental analysis. The factors used in quantitative analysis and the weight placed on those factors may not be predictive of a security's value. In addition, any model may contain flaws or the model may not perform as anticipated. Stocks of mid cap companies pose special risks, including possible illiquidity and greater price volatility than stocks of larger, more established companies.</p> <h4>Benchmarks</h4> <p>The Russell Midcap® Value Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S. market for medium capitalization value stocks.

This is a good opportunity to see where the business itself stands, but also importantly a chance to reexamine the Bitcoin side of things, because the price of Bitcoins in February of 2026 isn’t what it was even a few short months ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Is Meaningful, But Bitcoin Losses Are the Story in Q4</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After positive quarters in which Hut 8’s profits were more or less entirely a function of their digital assets (which is to say, Bitcoin) appreciating in value, Q4 saw them not just turn to loss, but decidedly so. Once again, the bottom line is driven overwhelmingly by what the price of Bitcoin did, going down in this case.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Q4 2024</p></td> <td><p>Q4 2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$31.7 million</p></td> <td><p>$88.5 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>$11.4 million</p></td> <td><p>$53.5 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gain on Digital Assets</p></td> <td><p>$308 million</p></td> <td><p>($402 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Income</p></td> <td><p>$282 million</p></td> <td><p>($435 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>$152 million</p></td> <td><p>($280 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Adjusted EBITDA</p></td> <td><p>$311 million</p></td> <td><p>($348 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GAAP EPS</p></td> <td><p>$1.37</p></td> <td><p>($2.53)</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412645-hut-8-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results\">press release</a> from Q4 earnings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top line growth is meaningful year over year here, of course, but once again the Gain on Digital Assets line dwarfs everything else, and by the time we get to net income we’re left with either positive earnings that are exclusively from that gain, as in 2024, or a net loss that is the loss on digital assets compounded with further operating losses from the rest of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One could argue, indeed, that the earnings we were seeing in past quarters are largely illusory, because the gains are entirely on paper in estimations of what digital assets are worth, and since the company never seems willing to divest those assets when they appreciate, they’re just gains until we get a quarter like this past one, where the price drops and suddenly they’re booking a loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which isn’t to say that the Bitcoin holdings are worthless. As Hut 8 moves to redefine itself away from its crypto business they managed to bring in some positive cash flow from the creation of the American Bitcoin stock. But such gains are not something we can expect them to be able to repeat, nor are they something to judge the overall business around.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Flow and the Margins of the Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting aside the Bitcoin question for a minute, we should look at a breakdown of the revenue by different segments of the company. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874565-hut-8-corp-hut-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call comment</a> was quite accurate declaring that Compute is the company’s “real growth engine” of the company’s business, and indeed, as it grows the margin of that segment has remained the strongest.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>Cost</p></td> <td><p>Margin</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Power</p></td> <td><p>$5.0 million</p></td> <td><p>$5.4 million</p></td> <td><p>(8.0%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Digital Infrastructure</p></td> <td><p>$1.6 million</p></td> <td><p>$1.4 million</p></td> <td><p>12.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compute</p></td> <td><p>$81.9 million</p></td> <td><p>$28.2 million</p></td> <td><p>65.6%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total</p></td> <td><p>$88.5 million</p></td> <td><p>$35.0 million</p></td> <td><p>60.5%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412645-hut-8-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results\">press release</a> from Q4 earnings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the point of view of revenue, Compute is by far the largest source, and the highest margin of the bunch. The revenue more than doubled year over year, from $31.7 million in 2024, and the margin maintained strength. So long as they are able to continue to grow the Compute segment going forward, it’s clear that’s the right decision to focus on, and the company seems to believe that AI demand for such services is going to allow them to grow that capacity into 2026 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Hut 8 stands as an over $6 billion market cap company, and for the entire fiscal year, their overall revenue was only $235 million, with gross costs of around $108 million. That’s a price/sales of 26.07, which is both enormous compared to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/valuation/metrics\">sector median</a> of 3.20 and much higher than Hut 8’s own 5-year average of 9.95.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That problem is compounded because once you get through the gross costs and into the operating costs, that revenue is more than entirely burned through. Noteworthy is that operating cash flow in 2025 actually was worse, even though the revenue and gross margin were substantially higher.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>FY 2024</p></td> <td><p>FY 2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$162 million</p></td> <td><p>$235 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>$75.8 million</p></td> <td><p>$127 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>($68.5 million)</p></td> <td><p>($139 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Investing Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>($188 million)</p></td> <td><p>($754 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financing Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>$312 million</p></td> <td><p>$856 million</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: Latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/170426851\">10-K</a> from SEC)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Herein lies the problem: Hut 8 is growing, but the top line revenue is still paltry for a company their size, and that growth isn’t bringing them closer to operating break-even so far. When trying estimate the underlying value of Hut 8 we have to include not only their tangible assets, which are largely Bitcoins and depreciating equipment, but also what the cash generation potential of the business is actually worth. In this case, the latter is seemingly worth very little at present. That could change, but for now, it’s not a $6 billion business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the other cash flow lines, we see Investing Cash Flow is strongly negative, both because of substantial CapEx in both years ($120 million in 2024 and roughly $197 million in 2025) which, again, operations aren’t able to pay for, and because they continue to spend large amounts of money buying more Bitcoins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Financing Cash Flow line is where Hut 8 is ultimately paying for all this, and in both cases that included issuing more debt, though also issuing more shares of common stock, which is obviously going to have dilutive consequences for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Underlying Value on the Balance Sheet</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Cash and Equivalents</p></td> <td><p>$44.9 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Assets</p></td> <td><p>$408 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>$376 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Digital Assets</p></td> <td><p>$1.3 billion</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Property and Equipment</p></td> <td><p>$643 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Shareholder Equity</p></td> <td><p>$1.42 billion</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: Latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/170426851\">10-K</a> from SEC)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has a modest balance sheet all told, in that they have a not great but sufficient current ratio of 1.09, and a price/book ratio of 4.31, which isn’t hugely higher than the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/valuation/metrics\">sector median</a> of 3.51.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">None of this would be immediately objectionable if Hut 8 was a business with positive operating cash flow. With that not being the case, however, valuation has to be justified almost entirely through digital assets. That raises the question of both risk and potential upside, and we find that despite restructuring itself substantially, that’s still a matter of Bitcoin prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw in Q4 that if Bitcoin prices depreciate bottom line is going to go down with it, irrespective of how the rest of the company is executing. On the other hand, if Bitcoin prices quickly rebounded and tested new highs, history suggests that investors would reward Hut 8 shareholders on the basis on the substantial assets they’re holding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the digital assets, however, there’s not much here, as Hut 8 also has growing debt and equipment that includes a lot of the type of technology that depreciates rapidly over time. Here again, a balance sheet with a lot of such equipment would be easier to justify if Hut 8 was using that equipment to generate cash flow, but so far they simply aren’t.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hope Springs Eternal Even If Bitcoin Doesn’t</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has growth prospects in its business, and conceivably there is a future in which their GPU-as-a-service business model grows to the point that they are able to generate good cash flow with it. The gross margin in their Compute segment reflects that. It’s just right now that segment is far too small for a company of their size, and growth remains a work in progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m going to reiterate a hold rating on Hut 8, even though I feel that the stock is as it stands somewhat overpriced for what you’re getting, because the growth potential of their business can’t be discounted, and the market seemingly is willing to pay a substantial multiple for exposure to Bitcoin price increases. I honestly think the path of least resistance for Bitcoin bulls would be to buy Bitcoins, but clearly there is a market for miners, and even in the case of Hut 8, former miners.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q4 conference call shows that the corporate officers remains highly bullish about the direction they’re taking Hut 8. I don’t think the current share price is particularly enticing, but those who believe in the business model should keep a close eye on how they grow and, importantly, how soon they are able to get to operating break-even, because the future of this company depends heavily on getting there.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://help.zscaler.com/logs-fair-use/zscaler-ai-guard-licensing-and-fair-use\" rel=\"nofollow\">company's website</a> states that AI Guard \"is licensed based on a platform subscription fee and the number of tokens purchased for the subscription term in an order.\" Since <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/ai-robots-outnumber-workers-agents-few-decades-citi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">some believe</a> AI agents will eventually outnumber human workers, Zscaler potentially has a large pool of non-human AI agents to generate revenue from, replacing revenue lost due to the SaaSpocalypse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because Zscaler could make money from Agentic AI, this recent dip might be a good chance to buy the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Security as a Significant New Revenue Pillar</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the market is currently highly concerned that AI might be a deal-breaker for investing in Zscaler, it has actually become a concrete financial contributor, enough that management considers AI Security its third revenue growth pillar, alongside its original pillar of <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/zero-trust-exchange-zte\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Trust Everywhere</a> and its second pillar of <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/data-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data Security Everywhere.</a></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1149\" data-height=\"640\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler's platform solutions.\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's AI Security can be broken down into two buckets: Security for AI apps and Agentic Operations.

Under ITOps, the company names <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/zscaler-digital-experience-zdx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zscaler Digital Experience</a>™ (ZDX), a service that enables IT teams to detect, troubleshoot, and resolve user and customer experience issues across devices and software, and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/step-future-zdx-3-exciting-new-features-zdx-copilot-data-explorer-and-hosted\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZDX CoPilot</a>, an AI-powered virtual assistant for the ZDX platform. Although the company has yet to announce further plans in ITOps, it appears to be leaning toward making all IT operations autonomous. So, investors should look out for further services under the ITOps umbrella.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SecOps combines IT operations and information security to strengthen an organization's cybersecurity posture by providing tools to help the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) assess risks to the company's assets. Some of these tools include <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/resources/solution-briefs/risk360.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Risk360</a>, a service that shows an organization's top cyber risk exposures and possible financial impacts. Other tools include <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/business-insights\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Insights</a>, an analytics tool that shows a business how employees and customers use its SaaS apps and office space, <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/vulnerability-management\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unified Vulnerability Management</a> (UVM), a cloud-native risk‑based vulnerability management system that shows the CISO which security vulnerabilities actually matter and how to fix them, <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/zscaler-itdr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Identity Threat Detection</a>, which shows the company when attackers are trying to misuse, steal, or abuse a company’s accounts and credentials, and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/caasm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management</a> (CAASM), which gives management creates a clean, authoritative inventory of all the company's assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler also includes Red Canary under Agentic Operations. Zscaler closed <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/press/zscaler-completes-acquisition-red-canary-accelerate-innovations-agentic-ai-driven-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">its $675 million acquisition</a> of Red Canary, a Managed Detection and Response (MDR) provider, on August 1, 2025. MDR is a service that combines advanced security tools with human threat hunters to prevent data breaches. Red Canary has gotten off to an excellent start. Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") Kevin Rubin said at the Barclays 23rd Annual Global Technology Conference: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>So as we had mentioned going into the quarter, we expected Red Canary to contribute $83 million of ARR at the close. So that was the amount of underlying business that we picked up. And then we had shared that we expected Red Canary to deliver $95 million throughout fiscal '26, which effectively implies, if you just straight line it, $3 million a quarter. And our commentary was that they actually did a little better than that in Q1. So in addition to the underlying strength we saw in our organic business, we also saw better performance in the Red Canary in the quarter.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The commentary indicates Red Canary’s first-quarter ARR is growing faster than management initially forecast, suggesting Zscaler is already cross-selling Red Canary to its user base and that the consolidation is likely going smoothly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Security for AI apps lets companies safely leverage tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and other generative AI systems, without users or AI agents leaking data or violating compliance rules, while keeping employees productive. The cybersecurity risks posed by AI aren't only theoretical. Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") Jay Chaudhry said on the first-quarter FY 2026 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4847697-zscaler-inc-zs-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>: \"One of the largest AI companies recently reported that a bad actor hijacked its AI coding assistant to autonomously perform a large-scale cyberattack against multiple organizations.\"</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-17719165522599812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1133\" data-height=\"613\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-17719165522599812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows the architecture for AI Guard Rails.\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-17719165522599812_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-17719165522599812_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-17719165522599812_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-17719165522599812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>November 2025 Corporate IR Presentation.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Security for AI Applications includes <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/reporting-zenith-live-2025-advancing-data-security-ai-and-llms\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI guard</a>, which acts as a guardrail for AI by monitoring real-time prompts and responses, blocking malicious inputs, and securing sensitive data; <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/resources/brochures/ai-asset-management-security.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Asset Discovery</a>, which limits AI <a href=\"https://www.pillar.security/blog/what-is-ai-assets-sprawl-causes-risks-and-control-strategies\" rel=\"nofollow\">asset sprawl</a> by finding every AI system an organization uses; and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/ai-access-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secure Access to AI Apps</a>, which provides Zero Trust access controls (allows only the right people and agents use secure AI tools).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler AI <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/zpedia/ai-red-teaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Teaming</a>, not to be confused with Red Canary, is a service that uses automated tools to simulate an attack to test whether an organization's AI can be tricked, misled, or abused before a real hacker attack.

With SPLX, we now deliver AI Red teaming to enable automated and continuous testing of AI apps at scale. Our AI Red teaming solution integrates with customers' CI/CD [Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery] pipelines, making it easy to test for hallucination, bias, behavior drift and more. Several customers, including a Fortune 150 transportation company and a Fortune 100 service provider have already deployed AI Red teaming.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Be careful not to get confused when management discusses AI, as it is easy to mistake whether they are referring to the overall AI Security segment or to the subsegments: Security for AI apps and Agentic Operations. When investors parse through earnings calls for information about its AI initiatives, make sure to clearly understand what management is referring to. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") Jay Chaudhry forecasted that Agentic Operations would reach $400 million in ARR by the end of FY 2026 during the fourth-quarter FY 2025<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4818709-zscaler-inc-zs-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> earnings call</a>. However, CEO Chaudry said on the first quarter FY 2026 earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I'm particularly pleased with our AI Security pillar, which grew over 80% year-over-year and has already exceeded our FY '26 target of $400 million ARR, 3 quarters earlier than expected. With the strong demand, I expect AI Security ARR to exceed $0.5 billion by the end of this fiscal year.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that on the fourth-quarter earnings call, Chaudry discussed the subsegment Agentic Operations alone, whereas on the first-quarter FY 2026 earnings call, he referred to the overall AI segment. If you put the two statements together, management expects $400 million from Agentic Operations and infers $100 million from Security for AI apps for a total of $0.5 billion in ARR by the end of FY 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Security pillar's first-quarter FY 2026 growth of 80% year over year and ARR exceeding FY' 26 targets three quarters earlier than expected indicate Zscaler's AI initiatives are growing like a weed, evidence that the SaaSpocalypse narrative of agentic AI hurting Zscaler may be in error.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Excellent first quarter fiscal year (\"FY\") 2026 results</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717693884523416_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1245\" data-height=\"606\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717693884523416_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image compares Zscaler's first quarter FY 2026 guidance to actual results.\" width=\"640\" height=\"312\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717693884523416_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717693884523416_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717693884523416_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717693884523416_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>First Quarter FY 2026 Earnings Presentation.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler had a \"beat and raise\" quarter, beating its own first-quarter guidance and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZS/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\">analysts' estimates</a>. Management's initial revenue guidance for FY 2026 was $3.676 billion to $3.698 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 21.9% to 22.7%. The company raised its annual revenue guidance for FY 2026 in the first quarter to $3.282 billion to $3.301 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 22.8% to 23.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the company reported strong non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.96, beating analysts' estimates of between $0.85 and $0.86, management reported a GAAP net loss of $11.6 million. Some investors are becoming increasingly fed up with the gap between non-GAAP and GAAP numbers, likely driven by high stock-based compensation (\"SBC\"). The company's SBC as a percentage of total revenue was 24.58% at the end of the first quarter, very high compared to other tech companies. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ZScaler also reported non-GAAP gross margins of 79.91%, a 66 basis points (\"bps\") year over year decline from 80.57%. CFO Rubin gave the following reasoning for the gross margin dip: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I'd like to remind investors that we are introducing new products that are experiencing strong growth and are optimized for faster go-to-market rather than margins. This will continue to influence our gross margins on a quarterly basis. We plan to optimize new products for margins over time as they scale.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although this is a valid reason, growth investors may lower their valuation of a stock if gross margins decline. Investors also disliked this commentary from the CFO: \"With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we will invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth and profitability.\" Investors are concerned that \"investing aggressively\" may slow operating margin expansion, thereby delaying the time to GAAP profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the increased FY 2026 revenue guidance, analysts' FY 2026 revenue estimates of $3.28 billion to $3.30 billion were seen as in line with expectations, and, at Zscaler's valuation on November 25, the market wanted to see expectations blown away to continue awarding it a premium valuation. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1014\" data-height=\"585\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler increased its FY 2026 guidance.\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>First Quarter FY 2026 Earnings Presentation.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the stock dropped 13% the day after the company released its first-quarter FY 2026 results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What to look for moving forward</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important numbers to monitor the health of a SaaS company is ARR, as it measures renewal strength, forward revenue visibility, underlying demand, upsell/cross‑sell momentum, and the durability of the business model. Since a difference as small as 5% in growth rates can markedly change compounding over three to five years, investors should watch Zscaler's ARR to see if it can re-accelerate growth above 25%. The market will generally award a premium SaaS multiple (15–20× forward revenue) to a stock with a 25% ARR growth rate, a mid‑tier SaaS forward multiple (10–14×) to a stock with a 20–25% ARR growth rate, and a legacy SaaS multiple (6–9×) to a stock with less than a 20% ARR growth rate. Since Zscaler currently trades at a 7.728 multiple, the market may be pricing in that Zscaler's ARR growth will settle in the lower end of a 20% to 25% range and that it will be unable to reaccelerate ARR above 25%. Some investors may believe the company currently sits at fair value.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the market could still re-rate the valuation upwards if Zscaler maintains over 20% ARR growth over multiple years; AI Security sustains over 80% growth, or AI Security ARR exceeds $0.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2026.

RPO is a future-oriented measure that represents the total value of contracted revenue yet to be recognized. The market interprets RPO growing faster than revenue as the sales pipeline strengthening (revenue visibility improving), the sales team executing larger or longer deals, or potential revenue acceleration. The market may price in a higher revenue multiple if Zscaler can maintain RPO growth in the 30–35% range or higher, revenue growth in the mid‑20s, and ARR growth in the low‑20s or higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A word of caution, RPO doesn't perfectly predict future revenue acceleration as the mix of contract duration, billing terms, deal size, and seasonality can sway the number either positively or negatively. So, only use RPO as one piece of the puzzle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last area you should closely monitor is the company's rule of 78, an offshoot of 40, a metric invented in 2015 by venture capitalists Brad Feld and Fred Wilson to assess whether a SaaS company's growth is sustainable. The rule states that a SaaS company's revenue growth rate plus its profit margin should be at least 40%. The earliest version of the equation didn't explicitly specify which profit margin to use. However, <a href=\"https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brad Feld</a> did post in a blog the following comment:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Profit is harder to define. Are we talking about EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization], Operating Income, Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Cash Flow or something else. I prefer to use EBITDA here as the baseline and then back test with the other percentages.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One reason he stated it that way is that different profit margins can produce different results. For instance, the company uses its first-quarter FY 2026 FCF margin of 52% and its 26% revenue growth to calculate what it calls the Rule of 78, which would be one of the best in the industry. However, if you use the company's non-GAAP operating margin of 22%, the equation would produce a Rule of 48, and if you use its GAAP operating margin of -4.6%, it would equal 21.4, which would be an indication that growth was unsustainable long term, which is a big reason that investors are concerned about the company's GAAP profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The weakness of using the FCF margin is that it is a volatile figure that can swing due to billing cycles, big changes in working capital, and heavy growth investment and Capital Expenditure cycles; it doesn't directly measure a company's profitability. So, caution is warranted when looking at Zscaler's Rule of 78, and you should never compare Zscaler's stated Rule of 78 to a competitor's Rule of 40 measure using different profitability numbers, such as EBITDA margin or Operating margin, because that's like comparing Apples, Oranges, and Pears. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all of those caveats in mind, as long as Zscaler sustains a FCF margin near 50% while growing revenue above 25%, the market may be more willing to award it a premium valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the first quarter, its cash and short-term investments were 3.321 billion. The company's convertible senior debt was $1.699 billion, and its operating lease was $0.066 billion, for a total long-term debt of $1.765 billion.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.925, indicating that the company finances its operations primarily with equity rather than debt. Since a current ratio between 1.0 and 2.0 is the sweet spot for recurring‑revenue SaaS businesses, the company's 1.745 current ratio indicates it is well positioned to cover its near‑term liabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I usually calculate a company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio. However, depending on how an analyst calculates ZScaler's EBITDA, it is close to the borderline between slightly negative and slightly positive. For instance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZS/income-statement\">Seeking Alpha reports</a> ZScaler's TTM EBITDA as -67.7 million. Different third-party websites report its EBITDA as high as $183 million. The company's EBITDA is so close to the profitability threshold that the net-debt-to-EBITDA calculation is not very useful. However, some investors may be concerned about Zscaler's EBITDA being negative or barely profitable. Others believe that the company's prodigious FCF and cash exceeding long-term debt mean it will have little issue repaying the debt. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major issue is that its long-term debt is convertible, which can dilute existing investors in addition to the substantial SBC.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's trailing 12-month (\"TTM\") price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 8.791, below its three-, five-, and seven-year median. If the company can reaccelerate ARR to 25% or higher, it may return to at least its three-year median. At its three-year median, its price would be $249.50, a 56% rise above its February 20 closing price of 159.75.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following compares Zscaler's forward P/S, P/S/G, TTM FCF margin, gross margin, operating margin, and return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") to its cybersecurity peer group.

However, its P/S/G is 0.33, well below the peer median of 0.63. Some investors may have concerns relating to the company's long‑term margin expansion, as reflected in its P/S/G trading meaningfully below its peers'. However, bullish investors may interpret the P/S/G trading below its median as a sign of undervaluation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's TTM FCF margin of 32.6% is only slightly above the peer group's median of 32.35%. Be aware that the Rule of 78 calculation uses quarterly FCF margin, while this comparison uses TTM FCF margin, which smooths out the cyclicality of the company's FCF, which fluctuates wildly quarter to quarter. Its TTM gross margin of 76.7% is above the peer group's TTM gross margin of 75.9%. Zscaler's TTM operating margin of -4.7% is below the peer group's median of 6.55%, and its TTM ROIC of -13.4% is below the peer group's median of -0.85%, raising investor concerns about Zscaler's operating efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking all these factors together, the company may be fairly valued, with potential upside if it maintains ARR growth in the low 20s over the next two years, revenue growth of 20% over the next two years, maintains TTM FCF margins in the low 30s or above, and achieves GAAP operating profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's TTM non-GAAP price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49.61 is well above the Information Technology (\"IT\") median of 22.69, suggesting potential overvaluation or that the market has priced in earnings-per-share (\"EPS\") acceleration. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's FY 2026 forward P/E-to-estimated-EPS growth (\"PEG\") ratio is 2.26, calculated by dividing its 2026 forward P/E by its estimated EPS growth rate of 16.55%. Typically, growth investors consider high-margin mid-tier SaaS companies like Zscaler to be overvalued when their PEG ratio exceeds 2.0. As a result, at the current PEG ratio, the company may have no upside. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1475\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler's forward P/E and analysts' estimated EPS growth.\" width=\"640\" height=\"134\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"134\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bull case for Zscaler is ARR rising to 25%, Zscaler's AI programs becoming recognized as a winning solution, and its GAAP operating margin turning positive.

For instance, CrowdStrike's current forward P/E is 72.35, and Cloudflare's is 142.36.

If Zscaler's FCF margins remain relatively high, while GAAP operating margin expansion stalls, the market may eventually refuse to value it on a P/S or P/FCF and demand to see real GAAP earnings. The market may also punish the stock on even the slightest decline in revenue growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since running AI workloads may require significant spending on computing power and data, the market is concerned that Zscaler's costs for AI inference compute, memory storage, and large-scale data administration will increase as it ramps up numerous AI products, potentially adversely affecting margins. Robert W. Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari asked the following question on the first-quarter earnings call: \"As you're scaling these kind of video-rich products, the AI Guard, and how to think about the margins here?\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Video-rich products\" refers to the fact that Zscaler's products, like ZDX's Digital Experience Monitoring, analyze all data passing through it to stop potential cybersecurity threats. Since Zscaler monitors video traffic through apps like Zoom or Teams, there is concern that processing bandwidth-intensive video streams could cost Zscaler a lot of money, hurting its profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Chaudry tries to alleviate those concerns with the following answer:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Since the models and things they're using are really on a fairly well confined set of data, we haven't seen any massive change in gross margins. If these things change over time, I'm sure we'll let you guys know.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that he never said AI model costs would never become an issue; he just said it wasn't an issue right now. CFO Rubin added:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>And maybe just to continue on that thread. Look, for Q1, we're pleased with the margin profile. We're comfortable with the Q2 guide. And then as we look into the back half of the year, you will notice that there's margin expansion in the guide in the back half. We are orientated to growth, but you know that we're also very mindful of the financial model and operating margin.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should closely monitor margins for signs of deterioration from its expansion of AI initiatives. If you begin to see gross margin compression, the AI-powered growth thesis for buying this stock may break down. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another concern for investors is the macroeconomic environment. Gartner recently published <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-02-11-gartner-survey-finds-low-growth-econ-enviro-remained-top-concern-among-risk-leaders-in-q425\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article</a> that stated: \"[A] survey of 367 senior risk and assurance executives – taken in the final quarter of 2025 – revealed that the low-growth economic environment, which relates to financial instability, trade concerns, high unemployment and inflation, continued to concern risk leaders...\" A weak economic environment can prompt enterprise customers to slash their IT budgets, potentially hurting Zscaler if organizations delay or cancel spending on its products. CEO Chaudry spoke on the macroenvironment on the company's first-quarter earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Broadly speaking, there's no significant growth in macro environment. IT budgets remain tight. There is pressure on CIOs [Chief Information Officers]. There is far less pressure on the cyber side of it. So cyber is under less pressure. We do see scrutiny for large deals similar to what we shared in the past. But two areas are still of high interest to customers. One is Zero Trust Security because of all these breaches happening out there and second is AI security because everyone is trying to do some level of deployments of AI applications because CIOs feel like if they aren't doing anything in this area, they'll be viewed as laggards.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, although the economic environment is a headwind, at this point, it's not enough to bust the investing thesis for Zscaler, because the one area in IT that enterprises are spending money on is cybersecurity, specifically Zero Trust Security and AI security. Investors should monitor earnings calls for management's language on delayed deals causing revenue misses, which would be a symptom of macroeconomic factors affecting Zscaler.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last significant Zscaler risk that I will cover in this article is Red Canary integration. Although Red Canary is a key piece of Zscaler's \"AI-powered SOC (Security Operations Center)\" strategy to fight AI threats with AI security agents, analysts are concerned about Red Canary churn. On the first quarter earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall asked the following question: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Maybe I just wanted to ask a question about Red Canary and just how it's kind of performing towards expectations given that you guys have been looking at a fair amount of churn within your kind of assumptions for that business. Just any context around that performance would be helpful.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta wants to know whether the churn management expected actually materialized. Investors are concerned that Zscaler's guide to \"a fair amount of churn\" in Red Canary’s ARR base raises legitimate questions about the stability of its customer base, the quality and length of its existing contracts, and whether Zscaler would need to rebuild the book of business from scratch to offset the churn. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, analysts and investors are concerned that the acquisition will adversely impact margins and ARR, as Red Canary carries several integration risks, including sales-team integration, product-and-engineering-team integration, and the risk that it distracts management from its core Zero Trust business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Chaudry responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The integration of Red Canary with Zscaler is going very well. G&amp;A integration was done right away. The two other main areas were: one, engineering end products. We're integrating Red Canary's agentic AI technology with Zscaler platform doing well. Second is go-to-market. Red Canary's go-to-market team has become security operations specialist team. It's working with our field sales organization, which is uncovering opportunity. So seeing a vast majority of Zscaler Red Canary pipeline is now coming from Zscaler customers.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFO Rubin added:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Yes. Look, I would just add that Red Canary is trending slightly better than our previous guidance. But keep in mind that we don't believe that Red Canary's contribution is material to our overall business. So as we go forward, we don't intend to provide specific color on Red Canary.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management answered Meta's question directly and addressed some of the other risks that investors are concerned about. Since Red Canary’s ARR contribution is small relative to Zscaler’s total ARR, its incorporation risk, while real, doesn't break the buy thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler is still a buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's negative GAAP profitability and lack of meaningful EBITDA make the stock ill-suited for value investors. However, growth‑oriented investors focused on ARR, FCF, and operating leverage may still be interested in Zscaler's potential upside. Since Zscaler has strong FCF margins, growth investors may view it as attractive and not purely speculative despite negative GAAP earnings.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1139\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler's Serviceable Addressable Market.\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>November 2025 Corporate IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's TTM revenue of $2.83 billion is 2.7% of its Serviceable addressable market (\"SAM\") of $104 billion.

Information technology stocks led the benchmark<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 1000 Value Index in the fourth quarter, followed closely by communication services and health care, which saw positive performance thanks to lower policy uncertainty, improved earnings, attractive valuations and a pickup in M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) activity. Despite a 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate in December, elevated long-term yields weighed on two sectors: real estate and utilities—the latter also suffering as the artificial intelligence trade pulled back.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Contributors: </strong>Holdings in Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), Freeport-McMoRan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>) and OneMain (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMF\" title=\"OneMain Holdings, Inc.\">OMF</a>). Stock selection in materials, IT and an overweight to health care.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Detractors: </strong>Holdings in Corcept Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CORT\" title=\"Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated\">CORT</a>), Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FISV\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FISV</a>) and Charter Communications (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHTR\" title=\"Charter Communications, Inc.\">CHTR</a>). Stock selection in the health care, financials and communication services sector and an underweight to the IT sector.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Outlook: </strong>With value spreads near historic extremes and AI adoption poised to broaden economic benefits, we see an attractive probability gap that creates meaningful upside potential for valuation-driven investors.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The Portfolios mildly underperformed their benchmark in a quarter that broadly favored value over growth, as declines in health care overcame strength from technology and materials stocks.</li> <li>Stock selection in the health care sector was the greatest detractor from relative returns in the fourth quarter, largely owing to the decline in drug developer Corcept Therapeutics, whose stock fell following the release of a FDA Response Letter for its relacorilant program, citing the need for additional evidence to support approval. With the prospect of the company having to lean more heavily on its legacy products, which are under pressure from greater generic competition, we elected to exit the position.</li> <li>Our top performer was Micron Technology, which continued to extend its strong 2025 performance following attractive earnings results and upbeat guidance due to accelerating AI-driven demand, tightening memory supply and improving pricing dynamics across DRAM and high-bandwidth memory markets. Performance was also bolstered by copper miner Freeport McMoRan, whose shares advanced alongside the commodity price on improving global growth expectations, a weaker U.S. dollar and continued optimism around long-term demand tied to electrification and energy transition trends.</li> <li>Newmont (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM\" title=\"Newmont Corporation\">NEM</a>), in the materials sector, engages in the production and exploration of gold properties, as well as the exploration for copper, silver, zinc, lead, and other metals. The company's share price moved higher alongside gold prices during the quarter. Additionally, we believe that the market is beginning to recognize discount in the company's share price given the current price of gold and attractive free cash flow generation.</li> <li>Fiserv, in the information technology sector, provides payment and financial services technology. The company's stock declined after reporting disappointing third quarter results, missing earnings expectations, cutting full-year guidance and announcing a leadership shake-up, which raised investor concerns about growth and execution.</li> <li>Charter Communications, in the communication services sector, operates as a broadband connectivity and cable operator company serving residential and commercial customers. The company's stock declined after reporting weak third quarter results with subscriber losses, missing earnings expectations and announcing workforce reductions, which heightened investor concerns about growth and rising costs.</li> <li>In the fourth quarter, we made several changes within our financials holdings. For example, we swapped our exposure within regional banks by replacing M&amp;T Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTB\" title=\"M&amp;T Bank Corporation\">MTB</a>) with Fifth Third Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FITB\" title=\"Fifth Third Bancorp\">FITB</a>). We believe that Fifth Third is poised to accelerate its growth by combining its best-in-class digital strengths with recently acquired AmeriCorps's middle-market franchise in fast-growing, attractive regions in the Southeast, Texas and California, ultimately upgrading our overall return profile.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>At a broad level we underestimated the resilience of the market and the economy to the year's two big volatility events: the reveal of Chinese AI model DeepSeek and President Trump's Liberation Day. Both caused volatility to spike and relative performance pain despite ultimately proving incredibly short lived. The commonality in both is that we underestimated the structural resilience of the U.S. economy and the operating leverage that continues to support best-in-the-world free cash flow (FCF) margins for U.S. companies.</li> <li>On a broad level, the market continues to price value stocks relative to growth at a level that implies value has little chance of leading. Despite a couple of good years, value spreads have remained trapped at the cheapest 10% of their history. We think the catalyst for value's escape will, ironically, come from AI adoption. 2026 will be the year that AI has to justify the immense and accelerating capital investment. To do this, it will need to be diffused more broadly across the economy, driving material productivity gains and higher profit margins. If this occurs, it could narrow the margin, return and earnings growth gap between tech stocks and AI adopters, including value stocks not priced for this structural upside.</li> <li>Ultimately, we believe that the crucible of 2025 has helped sharpen our positioning for 2026. We are actively focused on finding AI adoption in sectors and industries where it is not currently priced, giving us exposure to the upside scenarios as we compound higher growth in a value wrapper. For the downsides, we are focused on companies generating free cash flow and with strong balance sheets. We have also continued to decrease individual stock volatility where we cannot reduce it as part of our portfolio construction. Finally, we are overweight real asset sectors such as energy and materials, which should do well in an inflation scenario while also compounding business value from robust ongoing free cash flow generation.</li> </ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Our main goal is to get back to making active valuation-disciplined investing look simple again, even if it isn't easy. While we approach every new year with humility and a focus on process discipline, we think positioning for many possible futures is critical in a market priced for a narrow set of outcomes — especially when the alternatives have much higher probabilities than what the market has priced. In an increasingly passive world crowded into the same few stocks and sectors, we think that this is a key source of differentiated returns for active, probability-driven managers like us.</li></ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <h4></h4> <h4>Top Equity Issuers (% of Total)</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Holding</th> <th>Portfolio</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Alphabet Inc</td> <td>4.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bank of America Corp</td> <td>3.76</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd</td> <td>3.69</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Johnson &amp; Johnson</td> <td>2.95</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <a href=\"https://amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon.com</a> Inc</td> <td>2.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Micron Technology Inc</td> <td>2.47</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chevron Corp</td> <td>2.22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EQT Corp</td> <td>2.21</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Walt Disney Co/The</td> <td>2.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CVS Health Corp</td> <td>2.04</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2><span>Average annual total returns (%) - as of December 31, 2025-Preliminary</span></h2> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Composite</th> <th>3-Mo*</th> <th>6-Mo*</th> <th>YTD*</th> <th>1-Yr</th> <th>3-Yr</th> <th>5-Yr</th> <th>10-Yr</th> <th>15-Yr</th> <th>20-Yr</th> <th>25-Yr</th> <th>Inception</th> <th>Inception Date</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Net of Fees</td> <td>2.87</td> <td>6.41</td> <td>8.85</td> <td>8.85</td> <td>11.28</td> <td>8.95</td> <td>7.07</td> <td>6.32</td> <td>4.91</td> <td>3.82</td> <td>6.50</td> <td>12/31/1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pure Gross of Fees</td> <td>3.62</td> <td>7.98</td> <td>12.10</td> <td>12.10</td> <td>14.59</td> <td>12.20</td> <td>10.27</td> <td>9.49</td> <td>8.05</td> <td>6.94</td> <td>9.68</td> <td>12/31/1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Benchmark</td> <td>3.81</td> <td>9.34</td> <td>15.91</td> <td>15.91</td> <td>13.90</td> <td>11.33</td> <td>10.53</td> <td>10.78</td> <td>8.32</td> <td>7.71</td> <td>9.63</td> <td>—</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>*Cumulative total returns</p> <h4>Benchmark(s)</h4> <p>Benchmark = Russell 1000 Value Index</p> <p><strong>The strategy returns shown are preliminary composite returns, subject to future revision (downward or upward).</strong></p> <p><strong>Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

This led me to mark a Buy rating on IMPP stock. With a stock price of $4.3 and an<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> mCap of ~$177 million and a zero-debt balance sheet backed by $172 million in absolute cash base, the enterprise value [EV] is virtually minimal. The strategic locking of 75% of fleet days into time charters backs stable cash flow and insulates Imperial Petroleum against spot market volatility and organic cash funds for an expansion to 26 vessels. The rationale behind my Buy rating is the floor formed by the $9.21 fully diluted Net Asset Value [NAV] and the $6.3 institutional capital raise. However, there are speculative elements. The main risk involves Imperial Petroleum's pattern for value-destructive equity dilution and the looming operational downtime from 12 scheduled vessel drydockings in 2026 that will temporarily suppress Imperial Petroleum’s earnings.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uncoupling IMPP’s EV From Its Unencumbered Liquidity Fortress And Counter-Cyclical Cash Flow</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major long-term positive (catalyst) for Imperial Petroleum’s stock price-upside is the absolute uncoupling of its EV from its liquidity stronghold and counter-cyclical cash flow. To expand more here, Imperial Petroleum is shifting from a highly volatile pure-play spot tanker operator into a diversified maritime infrastructure asset. To answer how? There is a fleet operational utilization rate of 88.7% and a strategic development that locked 75% of Imperial Petroleum’s calendar days into predictable time charter contracts. This development insulates Imperial Petroleum from freight rate volatility and, at the same time, drives massive predictable cash flows (<a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/137-imperial-petroleum-inc-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-2025-financial-and-operating-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">$57 million in operating cash flow</a> derived in YTD-FY2025 (9M). However, the main upside catalyst is in Imperial Petroleum stock’s current valuation against its zero-debt capital structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1099\" data-height=\"621\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"75% of Imperial Petroleum‘s calendar days into predictable time charter contracts\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Imperial Petroleum IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a current stock price of $4.3, yielding an mCap of ~$177 million, the EV is practically minimized by Imperial Petroleum's stated <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4852559-imperial-petroleum-inc-impp-q3-2025-earnings-call-prepared-remarks-transcript\">cash base of $172 million</a>. A long position in IMPP stock is like acquiring an expanding fleet of 19 vessels (soon to be 26 vessels, totaling 1.5 million deadweight tons) for minimal enterprise premium. This large liquidity pool acts as a counter-cyclical instrument in the capital-intensive maritime market. Instead of suffocating under high-interest-rate burdens and restrictive debt covenants, Imperial Petroleum’s balance sheet allows it to organically self-fund all forward growth. The scheduled delivery of an additional 5 handysize drybulk carriers, a post-Panamax drybulk carrier, and a massive 319,400 dwt product tanker will be capitalized through existing cash and internal cash flow. This factor is bypassing the prohibitive costs of maritime debt markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, this absolute removal of interest expense guarantees that every incremental dollar of EBITDA (that increased 46.7% Y/Y to $17.9 million in Q3-FY2025) drops directly to the bottom line. This factor will be expanding <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/138-imperial-petroleum-announces-management-estimate-of-net-asset-value-per-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">Imperial Petroleum's NAV</a>. Moreover, the $60 million registered direct equity offering priced at <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/137-imperial-petroleum-inc-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-2025-financial-and-operating-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6.3 in December 2025 </a>forms a strong institutional cost basis that is higher than the current traded price. Once Wall Street prices in the fact that the $52 million CapEx for 2026 acquisitions can be easily absorbed without impacting the liquidity moat, the extreme dislocation between the $4.3 share price and the management-estimated fully diluted NAV of $9.21 per share can quickly correct upwards, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To clarify more on this, my point is that through maintaining a strong balance sheet, Imperial Petroleum may have stripped away the traditional bankruptcy and refinancing risks (that plague shipping equities, in general). This strong architecture/financial state means that even in a recession where spot rates collapse, Imperial Petroleum’s locked-in time charter revenues and vast cash reserves can theoretically stabilize operations. All this backs a possible long-term upward re-rating of IMPP stock as the deep-value advantage simply becomes too obvious for institutional capital/smart money to ignore.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Of Chronic Equity Dilution With A Highly Concentrated Operational Bottleneck</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the long term, I am not ignoring the overarching risk of chronic equity dilution along with a highly concentrated operational bottleneck in FY2026. Despite holding a zero-debt balance sheet and driving a strong operating cash flow YTD, Imperial Petroleum did a highly questionable $60 million registered direct equity offering in December 2025. Raising equity at $6.3 per share amid holding over $100 million in cash and a fully diluted NAV of $9.21 per share is a harsh signal (from my perspective) that management prioritizes fleet-building and raw asset accumulation over per-share value accretion. This capitalization risk forms a value trap. To clarify, on how? If Wall Street locks in a sentiment that any forward cash flow spikes will be utilized as a base for further dilutive equity raises instead of capital return (buybacks/dividends), IMPP stock can suffer from a multiple compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a forward-basis, this effect can keep the stock price permanently disconnected from Imperial Petroleum’s asset value. Compounding this governance discount is a brutal operational cliff. Imperial Petroleum has scheduled 12 of its vessels to undergo mandatory drydocking in 2026. This is a big disruption that is sidelining almost half of the expanded 26-vessel fleet. The direct CapEx required for these <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/images/IMPPQ325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">drydockings is estimated at $14 million</a>. However, I am focusing on a far more destructive cost, which is the large opportunity cost of lost operational days. With a fleet that has an 88.7% operational utilization rate, removing 12 vessels from active service will eat up revenue and short-term operating income. When this loss of active charter days is happening with the $52 million in capital commitments needed to pay for the 3 Japanese-built drybulk vessels (scheduled for delivery between Q1-Q3-FY2026), Imperial Petroleum’s $172 million cash castle can be quickly drained out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1085\" data-height=\"391\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Imperial Petroleum 2026 Strategy\" width=\"640\" height=\"231\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"231\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Imperial Petroleum IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More so, if macro conditions deteriorate (like a reversal in Chinese iron ore demand and further OPEC+ production cuts that may be limiting Suezmax tanker demand), at the same time, when this operational downtime peaks, Imperial Petroleum can face a high cash burn cycle. The magnitude of this dual-risk case is big. All in all, Imperial Petroleum expands its physical footprint and erodes its outstanding share denominator that builds downward gravity on the stock price. Smart Money/Institutional investors observing this emergence of peak CapEx, halved operational fleet capacity, and an aggressive dilution may dump the stock irrespective of how theoretically cheap Imperial Petroleum’s EV appears.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imperial Petroleum Stock Valuation (Marks 72% Upside) And Q4 Alpha Protocol</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imperial Petroleum’s stock valuation needs an EV/EBITDA method focused on NAV and the enterprise liquidity base. As of now, Imperial Petroleum has a $172 million cash base with zero debt against an mCap of ~$177 million. This yields an EV of ~$5 million only for a fleet generating $49.6 million in EBITDA over YTD-FY2025 (9M). Imperial Petroleum’s pro forma fully diluted NAV is at $9.21 per share based on the assumption of all outstanding warrants after the December equity offering. To find a realistic target price, a governance and fleet age discount must be applied to Imperial Petroleum’s asset value. If I apply a current aggressive market discount [based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)] and use the forward 3.575x EV/EBITDA multiple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMPP/valuation/metrics\">50% below the sector median</a>) on annualized 2025 EBITDA of $66 million, it yields an EV of ~$236 million. Adding the current $172 million cash base leads to an equity value of ~$408 million. Dividing this by an estimated 55.2 million (508.03 million net assets/$9.21 NAV per share) fully diluted shares gives a fair value of $7.4 per share. This target price holds a highly logical +72% upside from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prior to the Q4 release, IMPP bulls can buy a baseline long-position. The current $4.3 stock price with post-Q3 swing prices-in the negativity of the December equity dilution and integrating the operating advantage (in my opinion). Q4 results will capture the full quarterly cash flow from the newly integrated 19-vessel fleet and the seasonal winter rate spikes in the product tanker market. These factors are backing a high probability for a strong earnings beat. After Q4, focus must shift to forward guidance. If Imperial Petroleum’s management provides a staggered timeline for the 12 scheduled FY2026 drydockings that protects baseline cash flow and confirms halting further stock dilution, bulls should aggressively scale long-side positions into the IMPP stock. On the negative, if earnings indicate unchecked CapEx and hints of further stock offerings, long-positions must be liquidated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1281\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Imperial Petroleum IMPP stock price recovery Post-Q3\" width=\"640\" height=\"410\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"410\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">___</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, with all that, Imperial Petroleum stock ticks a Buy rating due to an extreme, unignorable valuation disconnect. Imperial Petroleum, driving high FCF, holding $172 million in cash base with zero debt, and expanding to 26 vessels, cannot logically trade at an EV near zero. Moreso, the upside potential eclipses the downside risks at the $4.3 entry point. On a forward basis, I will be tracking the outstanding share count to check on absolute zero further dilution, the execution efficiency of the $52 million CapEx for the three pending drybulk acquisitions, and the scheduling of the 12 upcoming 2026 drydockings. Any deviation that signals deteriorating governance and unmanaged operational off-hire days may invalidate my bullish thesis.</p>",

The article was triggered by ABBV’s dividend<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> declaration made for Q1 2026 and rated the stock as a hold. As for </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">Merck &amp; Co., Inc.</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK\" title=\"Merck &amp; Co., Inc.\">MRK</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), my last analysis dated further back to July 16, 2025.

It also rated MRK as a hold.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, there have been a few new catalysts evolving around both heath care stocks. The remainder sections of this article will focus on A) the updates they provided in their recent FQ4 2025 earnings reports (ER), and B) their latest dividend announcements. As to be elaborated, the latest financial changes in FQ4, when combined with their latest dividend declarations, have materially changed their dividend cushion ratio in our model. More specifically, my analysis shows the continued improvement in MRK’s cushion ratio in contrast continued weakening in ABBV’s. This divergence is substantial enough to lead to a rating upgrade for MRK to buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me start with a quick recap of the FQ4 ER for both companies to prime the rest of the discussion. Both MRK and ABBV released their ER in early February (on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>, respectively). Both companies post robust results, both beating consensus estimates as shown in the snapshots below. AbbVie continued its upward momentum with a double digit YOY growth rate of 10.04% on the topline. In contrast, Merck demonstrated another quarter of earnings recovery following a weak start in the year. After suffering a YOY decline in Q1 and Q2, MRK’s revenue turned around and grew 3.72% and 4.97% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. These results suggest to me that the macroeconomic headwinds (such as the effects of drug pricing mentioned in my earlier articles) facing the health care sector are dissipating, supporting an overall favorable outlook for both stocks in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1944\" data-height=\"300\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"99\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1941\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"102\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRK and ABBV: Dividend cushion ratio in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The updated earnings, when combined with their latest dividend declarations, have brought the payout ratios of both stocks closer as shown in the top panel of the next chart charts.

To start, they fluctuate quite a bit due to quarterly profit uncertainties, especially in terms of accounting EPS payout ratios as shown in the bottom panel in the chart above. More fundamentally, the also completely ignore other important factors such as the use of leverage and the status of the balance sheet. From years of experiences, an effective framework I found that can overcome these limitations is the dividend cushion ratio (“DCR”). Details of the DCR is provided in Brian M Nelson’s book entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Value-Trap-Theory-Universal-Valuation/dp/0998038482\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Value Trap</em></a>. The key steps are quoted there to ease reference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The DCR is obtained by A) summing the existing net cash a company has on its balance sheet plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years, and B) dividing that sum by future expected cash dividends (including expected growth in them, where applicable) over the same time period. If the ratio is significantly above 1, the company generally has sufficient financial capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. The higher the ratio, the better, all else equal. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before presenting my results (shown in the next two charts for those who cannot wait), let me first point out a few modification I made to Nelson’s above framework. In step A quote above, his original framework subtracted the total debt to obtain the net cash position on the balance sheet. In my calculations, I only subtracted the current liabilities and the interest expenses on the consideration of MRK and ABBV’s profit consistency and credit ratings. With these considerations, I see virtually zero possibility in any foreseeable future for MRK or ABBV to have the need of repaying all their debts all at once. Thus, I feel appropriate to assess their cushion ratio based on the assumption that both MRK and ABBV only need to repay the current portion of their debts and service the interest payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bearing this modification in mind, let’s walk through the details of their DCRs now. The first observation that stands out is that both MRK and ABBV have been maintaining DCRs well above the 1x threshold. To wit, MRK’s DCR has been always above 2.0x since 2020 with a 6-year average of 2.29x as seen in the first chart. The same is true for ABBV’s DCR too as seen in the second chart, and its 6-year average reading is even better at 2.64x as shown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A yellow and red text on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1013\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A yellow and red text on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ABBV and MRK: CAPEX in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> observation that stands out is the divergence between MRK and ABBV’s cushion ratios. As seen, since 2021, MRK’s DRC has kept improving and my projected reading points to a further thickening to 2.57x in 2026, not only above its own historical average by a good margin but also exceeds my projected ratio for ABBV at 2.19x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging to the ER deeper, a key factor causing the divergence is their CAPEX plans. To wit, the next chart compares the Cash Flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CF\" title=\"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.\">CF</a>) to Capital Expenditure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPEX\" title=\"Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.0\">CAPEX</a>) ratio for ABBV and MRK in the past 5 years from 2021 to the present. This metric measures a company's ability to fund its physical asset investments using its operating cash flow, and a higher ratio is better with everything else being equal. As seen, AbbVie has significantly cranked up its CAPEX spendings in recent years. The company CF-CAPEX ratio was on average 25.59 in the past 5 years, which meant it spent on average about 3.9% (the inverse of 25.59) of its CF to fund its CAPEX in the past. The current reading is 15.86x per the FQ4 ER, which means it spent about 6.3% of its CF in the past quarter on CAPEX. Such a large increase in CF impacted its free cash flow, which in turn pressured its DCR. Judging by the guidance provided in its FQ4 ER, I expect ABBV’s CAPEX to remain alleviated in 2026 to support is various pipeline efforts. In contrast, MRK’s CF-CAPEX ratio has been on an upward trend in the past few quarters and sits above its long-term average as seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"200\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, ABBV’s CF-CAPEX ratio of 15.86x is completely manageable and sustainable in my experience despite the substantial change relative to its historical norm. Furthermore, as shown in the chart above, ABBV’s current CF-CAPEX ratio of 15.86x is still about 2x higher than Merck’s ratio of 7.92x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, ABBV is trading at a larger P/E ratio discount relative to MRK. To wit, the following screenshot compares their FWD P/E ratios. Based on FY1 EPS projection, MRK’s P/E is 24.15x, a premium of more than 56% compared to ABBV's reading of only 15.73x. Although note that with MRK’s better growth projection, its P/E ratios would quickly approach ABBV’s in FY2 (12.6x vs. 14.2x) and become lower than ABBV’s ratio in FY3 (11.4x vs 12.9x). Finally, judging by their dividend yields, I believe the above FY1 P/E comparison overstates MRK’s P/E premium. As an example, MRK’s forward yield of 2.74% is about 8% below its 4-year average yield, while ABBV’s forward yield of 3.03% is about 15% below its own 4-year average yield (see the last chart). Such as contrast suggests that ABBV is actually trading at a higher valuation premium than MRK.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this follow-up article on MRK and ABBV is largely promoted by 2 new developments since my last analyses: their latest FQ4 2025 ERs and their latest dividend declarations. A closer look at these developments suggests to me that the macroeconomic headwinds facing the sector are fading, which supports my overall positive view towards both ABBV and MRK. A look at their financials further shows their dividend safety with DCRs well above 1x. Although the divergence in their DCR, mostly due to their CAPEX plans, is substantial enough for me to upgrade MRK’s rating to buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"287\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"943\" data-height=\"274\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

He argued that “the risk of a substantial downturn in the labor market combined with a limited risk of higher inflation warranted another cut.” Mixed economic signals since that meeting are doing little to settle the debate, while </span><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/friday-gold-wrap/gold-just-issued-a-warning-the-fed-cant-ignore\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">gold, ever the monetary barometer</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, notched a fresh high of $5,236 per ounce on Monday.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Waller’s caution springs largely from the labor market. January’s headline payroll report showed a chunky 130,000 jobs gain—more than the previous nine months combined—and unemployment edging lower. Yet alternative trackers painted a far weaker picture: ADP recorded just 22,000 private positions, Revelio counted 3,000, and Challenger logged 108,000 <a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/peters-podcast/peter-schiff-jobs-vanished-no-surprise\" rel=\"nofollow\">layoff announcements</a>, the worst January since 2009. Official revisions already revealed that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870386-only-181k-total-jobs-gained-for-all-2025-after-massive-revisions-lower\" rel=\"noopener\">only 181,000 jobs were created in all of 2025</a>—an anemic 15,000 per month—and Waller expects further downward tweaks that could turn last year negative. He called the latest print “noise more than signal,” noting that three-quarters of the additions came from health care and construction, which together make up roughly one-fifth of employment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth data complicate the narrative. Real GDP expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, but private domestic final purchases—a better gauge of underlying demand—rose 2.4 percent. Manufacturing output jumped 0.6 percent in January, its best showing in almost a year, and service-sector purchasing manager indexes have been in expansion territory for 19 consecutive months. Still, consumption is cooling: personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth slid from 3.5 percent in the third quarter to 2.4 percent in the fourth as lower- and middle-income shoppers traded down or simply bought less.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On prices, core Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose 0.3 percent in January, up 2.5 percent year over year. Waller pegs core PCE at roughly 3 percent and “underlying” inflation near the Fed’s 2 percent target once tariff effects are stripped out. The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn much of last year’s import-tariff package muddies that outlook; the Administration plans to reinstate some duties, leaving future price pressures uncertain but, in Waller’s view, temporary. Upcoming readings—producer prices on February 27th, February payrolls on March 6th, and CPI on March 11th—will drive his March vote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, bullion’s record run suggests many savers aren’t banking on a quick return to monetary normalcy. With real yields still subdued and the Fed openly debating additional easing even as headline growth persists, gold’s appeal as a store of value remains strong, particularly for those wary of fiat-fuelled asset bubbles and shifting policy targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/commentaries/waller-calls-march-rate-move-a-coin-flip-as-jobs-data-diverge\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

It still has a lot of room to grow, few stores, but they have already proven profitable, a large addressable market, everything you want to see from a company in the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> QSR industry. The valuation isn't that bad either, but still close to my last </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812980-cava-group-stock-falls-after-despite-q2-eps-beat-but-still-only-a-hold-rating-upgrade\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, where I assigned a hold rating precisely because of the price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And now, <span></span>CAVA Group has just reported its Q4 earnings, which the market liked very much and made the stock jump about 8%. But even so, with this valuation, I would have liked to have seen a better result, especially regarding same-store sales for the quarter and for the outlook. So I'm downgrading CAVA stock to a sell rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings: Not Worth 8% Gains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span></span>CAVA's Q4 results were interesting, with non-GAAP EPS <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556209-cava-group-non-gaap-eps-of-0_04-beats-by-0_01-revenue-of-272_8m-beats-by-4_4m\">beating expectation</a>s by $0.01, which is very significant given that the market was only expecting $0.03, and the top line also positively exceeded market expectations by around $4.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full year was also very solid. Same restaurant sales were up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874157-cava-group-inc-2025-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation\">4%</a>, which is great considering that industry giants like Chipotle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a>) are struggling. Over 70 new stores were opened, and restaurant margins also remained at an interesting level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"855\" data-height=\"753\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cava FY 2025 highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>CAVA<span> Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Q4, specifically, was not so interesting. Okay, revenue grew 21% with the new openings, but same restaurant sales were only 0.5%. Even though the other quarters had been suffering, this was a worse quarter than the average for the year. The company's explanation was mainly that there was a decrease in guest traffic, which seems quite negative to me, even though the <span></span>CAVA Group managed to sustain a higher price and better mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same occurred with the profit margin at the restaurant level, which fell to 21.4%, and again, seasonally it is also a worse quarter, but note in the image below that in Q4 last year the margin was also slightly higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"964\" data-height=\"797\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4 2025 Cava Group Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"529\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>CAVA<span> Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I did not find anything worrying in terms of margin. Basically, there was an increase in costs related to deliveries and technology, in addition to some costs related to tariffs. So, given the company's momentum, I do not think it is something structurally bad. In addition, moving from the restaurant level to <span></span>CAVA as a company, G&amp;A expenses decreased in relation to revenue, which is very good and shows that the company is able to capture this operational leverage that will be crucial to unlocking value in a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would even say that this quarter was good for the <span></span>CAVA Group, but if the outlook had been a little better. Management mentioned that it expects to open about 75 stores in 2026, and the profit margin at the restaurant level also has a very reasonable expectation, but my problem was with same-restaurant sales. <span></span>CAVA mentioned that it expects something between 3% and 5%. I know that the momentum is not yet the best, but for the market to have given this “re-rating” to the stock, I expected a much clearer turning point, for example, some mention of a potential return to high single digits, especially since the company is still in a stage of maturation, has several initiatives to undertake, such as digitalization to grow even more, offering new items on the menu, increasing customer loyalty so that they order more often, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So overall, I found it to be a quarter that was just reasonable, far from me being sure that <span></span>CAVA will deliver super value to shareholders in the coming years, and as the market cap increased by ~8% in one day, it becomes more difficult to be bullish on the case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <span></span>CAVA Group Valuation: Not Good Enough Anymore</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way this quarter impacts valuation, in my view, is more negative than positive. My previous expectation was that <span></span>CAVA Group would reach ~1,000 units in 2032, and it should still achieve this, as it is opening ~75 per year, and if it accelerates to 80 halfway through, it can reach around 995 without too many problems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the problem was with revenue per restaurant. Before, I expected something closer to high single-digit growth per year, on average, so the bad momentum would pass and <span></span>CAVA would return to better numbers. But with an outlook between 3% and 5%, it is difficult to be convinced that revenue per restaurant will reach such a high CAGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I changed my assumption to 5% per year revenue per restaurant, and that's considering that they will deliver the top of the guidance and the next few years will be stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, we are talking about revenue of ~$3.8 billion in 2032. It seems quite feasible to me that <span></span>CAVA will be able to achieve this, but the market cap is at $8.4 billion after today's rise in CAVA stock. The price-to-sales ratio would be 2.2x, and that's after waiting until 2032. For comparison purposes, Dutch Bros (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS\" title=\"Dutch Bros Inc.\">BROS</a>), which is not exactly in the same sector but is also a company in the growth phase of the QSR industry, is currently trading at a P/S of 3.6x. Chipotle, which is already more mature, is also trading at a forward P/S of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/valuation/metrics\">3.6x</a>. So it seems like a very expensive multiple to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let's move on to net income, which is what really matters. If <span></span>CAVA continues to capture margin and reaches something closer to 13.5%, the same assumption as in the last article, we are talking about a net income of $513 million. The implied P/E is 16.4x, and that's after waiting until 2032.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CAVA assumptions - 2032\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author (Kenio Fontes)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To illustrate how bad this could be, if the market assumes a fair forward P/E of 25x in 2032, we are talking about a total return of 53% in about 6 years. The total return per year would be ~7%, and that is considering that <span></span>CAVA would deliver all of this without many obstacles along the way. Of course, if the momentum is much better than expected and the market assigns some premium, then the valuation makes sense again with an implied total return closer to double digits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main point for my downgrade is not because I think <span></span>CAVA Group is a bad company. In fact, I agree with the market on the qualitative side; it really is an interesting case. But the reason I see CAVA stock as a sell is mainly my disagreement with the market on valuation. I don't think there is a large margin of safety here, and Q4 earnings brought me more doubts than clarity in terms of revenue compounding over the next few years.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX\" title=\"Trex Company, Inc.\">TREX</a></span>) has already lost 27% of its value, justifying my hold and cautious stance before. Now, we are seeing some rebound attempts, driven by its better-than-expected Q4 2025 performance. Its fundamentals are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> still intact, which ensures sustainability and longevity. However, valuation still shows little upside potential despite the selloff. Technicals have improved, but caution is still advised.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TREX Q4 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combined effect of inflationary headwinds and housing market volatility continues to hammer housing-related industries like home furnishings and building products. Trex Company, Inc. is no exception as its sales contraction continues. Yet, its size and domestic market reach still help protect its profitability. This was evident in its most recent performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4 2025, its sales amounted to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224569700/en/Trex-Company-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224569700/en/Trex-Company-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" target=\"_blank\">$161.1M</a>, down by 3.9% YoY from $167.6M. This still spoke a lot about unfavorable market conditions amid weaker purchasing power and demand. It also halted the supposed comeback of the company. If you remember, its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX/income-statement\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX/income-statement\" target=\"_blank\">Q2 and Q3 2025 performance</a> showed sales recovery. With that, it may still take time to rebound. On a lighter note, TREX beat consensus expectations of $144.7M, which means that the actual sales were 11% higher than expected. It was even above the midpoint guidance range by the company of only $140-150M. It is also worth noting that the most recent YoY sales drop was already more manageable than in my previous coverage at 9.0%. This can tell us that TREX appears to be more adaptable to current market dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But again, it is still having a hard time coping with inflation. Despite its sales contraction, mounting cost pressures continued to take their toll. The operating costs and expenses still increased. As a result, the operating margin was only 2.2%, which was far lower than 18.9% YoY. The only consolation is that TREX sales were still enough to cover all its costs and expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1358\" data-height=\"821\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income <span></span>Statement (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Challenges</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stubborn inflation remains a challenge for TREX. At <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" target=\"_blank\">2.7%</a>, it is still higher than the Fed's target of 2.0% and close to the 16-month high of 3.0%. We must also understand that positive inflation means rising prices. So, weaker purchasing power and higher cost pressures must also be considered. New tariffs may exacerbate this situation since they typically raise domestic prices. On top of that, TREX has some tariff exposure considering its raw materials for composite decking, like aluminum and steel, sourced outside the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elevated house prices may also have negative spillovers into its business since lower housing demand may affect demand for its products and services. Currently, median prices are experiencing downward pressures. In Q4 2025, the median price was <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\" target=\"_blank\">$405,300</a>. This was already 8.4% lower than its all-time high of $442,600 in Q4 2022. However, it remains above $400,000 and way higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1792\" data-height=\"672\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Median Home Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Median Home Price (ST.

Because its operations remain profitable, its operating cash flow remains enough to cover capex and buybacks. Its timely debt repayments and issuances also support its cash flow. With that, its cash and cash equivalents nearly tripled in just a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"774\" data-height=\"765\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"633\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flo (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into its balance sheet, you can see a little improvement in its inventory management. Meanwhile, borrowings appear to be a concern at first glance since the whole amount will mature within a year. But if you look at its Net Debt/EBITDA Ratio of 0.4x (($133.5M - $3.8M) / $336.0M), the company only needs 0.4x years, or about five months, to repay the whole amount even if it doesn't have to. Even if it uses only 50% of EBITDA, the ratio will still be low at 0.7x. Either way, it needs less than a year to cover the whole borrowing. Hence, its liquidity remains safe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"681\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"694\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow (Author's Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"656\" data-height=\"731\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"713\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at external factors, there were some aspects to support TREX. For instance, existing home sales improved by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/existing-home-sales-end-2025-stronger-than-expected.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/existing-home-sales-end-2025-stronger-than-expected.html\" target=\"_blank\">5.1%</a> YoY last December. This shows that consumer spending was still resilient despite skyrocketing prices. I think the decrease in the median price helped. More importantly, the recent policy easing cycle encouraged and would encourage more homebuyers. After all, this can also lower mortgage rates in the US. Moreover, lower interest rates can boost economic activity as well as employment and wages to support consumption. Loans and credit cards may become more affordable, so discretionary spending on composite decking may be supported.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reassess its TREX's valuation, I made updates on the DCF model. As you can see, its FCFF increased a bit in line with the higher-than-expected revenues and earnings. This was crucial since I used the revenue model to estimate it. Meanwhile, I still set its perpetual growth rate at 2.0% to be consistent with the Fed's target inflation. Lastly, I estimated WACC using the capital asset pricing model. Note that I increased its risk premium to 6.0% to price in more risks. I just input 1.00 as its beta, assuming that it will be consistent with the S&amp;P 500. With that, I derived a TP or target price, of $46.47. If I add a 5% risk consideration, it will be $44.15. At its current price, TREX already has some upside potential. However, their actual gap remains narrow. Growth prospects are still too limited to justify any upside beyond my TP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1343\" data-height=\"545\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF Model\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DCF Model (Author's Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WACC\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"372\" height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">WACC (Authors Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technicals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TREX's technicals are starting to become bullish as the price increases with a more pronounced trend. It has also exceeded the 50-day SMA, showing that the current momentum is stronger than the average in the past 50 days. The 50-day SMA has also shifted upwards, which means that recent market sentiments have become more optimistic. The concern is that the most recent dip last Monday, broke below the dip last January 29. So, caution is still advised.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720792303211236_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1918\" data-height=\"874\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720792303211236_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720792303211236_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720792303211236_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720792303211236_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720792303211236_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis (Yahoo Finance<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its MACD and RSI also still suggest more observation. The MACD line is decreasing below the signal line, which suggests decreasing buying volume and increasing selling volume. Meanwhile, the histogram is still within negative territory, which implies that selling volume continues to outpace buying volume. Lastly, RSI shows that the downtrend was mainly due to overbuying that prompted profit-taking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079296715559_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1846\" data-height=\"843\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079296715559_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079296715559_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079296715559_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079296715559_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079296715559_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis (TradingView<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trex Company is still having a hard time coping with inflationary headwinds and housing market volatility. But its sound and intact fundamentals allow it to sustain its operations and take advantage of the recent interest rate cuts. Still, valuation is still not attractive enough to require an upgrade due to limited upside. Technicals have improved but still warrant caution as some indicators remain unfavorable. With that, I'm reiterating my hold rating.</p>",
