As developed markets face elevated volatility and slower<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> momentum, investors are increasingly turning to emerging economies for diversification, higher yields, and exposure to long-term structural growth themes.</span></strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>How monetary policy, commodity trends, and capital flows</strong> shaped emerging market performance in 2025 - and why these forces remain central to the 2026 outlook.</li> <li> <strong>The regional stories driving returns</strong>: from China’s policy direction and semiconductor strength in Korea and Taiwan to domestic demand boosting measures in Indonesia, Thailand, and India.</li> <li> <strong>Why geopolitical shifts and currency dynamics</strong> are enhancing the appeal of emerging markets, offering diversification at a time of elevated volatility and continued uncertainty in developed markets.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging market indices delivered a strong performance in 2025, supported by the rate-cut cycle that began in developed markets in 2024 and prompted investors to seek higher yields. Output growth in many emerging economies continues to outpace that of developed markets, whether inflation trends are disinflationary – as in China – or remain relatively sticky – as in Brazil. Higher economic growth and elevated country risk typically translate into higher interest rates, and the prospect of stronger returns attracted significant capital inflows. At the same time, volatility in developed markets - driven partly by fluctuations in US tariff rates – altered risk profiles and added to concerns around slower growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>msci em and crude oil price</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"868\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"msci em and crude oil price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, investors in search of safe-haven assets moved towards gold, while more risk-tolerant investors favoured emerging market equities. Metals also rallied strongly, benefitting countries with significant exposure to commodities. Chile and China, for instance, gained from the appreciation of copper and aluminium, respectively. The gold rally supported mining stocks, especially in South Africa, where rising gold prices bolstered the performance of domestic gold miners. By contrast, the outlook was more mixed for countries dependent on agricultural exports such as cocoa, sugar and cotton, which experienced price corrections.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">aluminium, copper and gold prices</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"889\" data-height=\"567\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"aluminium, copper and gold prices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic uncertainty following the tariff-related “Liberation Day” declared by President Trump also raised questions about the traditional safe-haven status of US treasuries and the US dollar. A weaker dollar can make higher-yielding currencies more attractive, increasing the appeal of emerging markets. The markets also offer geographical diversification at a time when tariff exposure and geopolitical tensions remain significant. Emerging economies with limited trade surpluses with the US may be particularly well placed to help hedge against geopolitical risks.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">geopolitical risk and volatility index</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"894\" data-height=\"563\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"geopolitical risk and volatility index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Export-driven economies – such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China – are still exposed to potential tariff changes as the US administration continues to focus on reducing its trade deficit. However, these economies hold competitive positions in advanced manufacturing. Recent earnings from SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>) illustrate the continued strength of Korean semiconductor demand. Similar momentum is evident in China and Taiwan, where the semiconductors, telecommunications and AI-related sectors remain important contributors to market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, Chinese policymakers met at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to outline the economic agenda for 2026. Key priorities included stimulating consumption and investment to support growth of around 5%. One challenge highlighted was the imbalance between strong domestic supply and weak domestic demand. Despite a record trade surplus in 2025, internal demand remains subdued. Authorities aim to revive investment following a slowdown in the second half of the year, with an emphasis on strengthening domestic-focused activity rather than prioritising the export-oriented manufacturing sector, which has remained resilient. China’s budget deficit target is expected to stay close to last year's record 4% of GDP, reflecting sustained public spending to support demand during the ongoing residential property downturn. Liquidity injections through lower reserve-requirement ratios and targeted interest rate reductions are likely, although any monetary easing is expected to be incremental.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese equity indices</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"565\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chinese equity indices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shanghai Composite Index rose 18% last year, its strongest annual performance since 2020. Between 2021 and 2025, technology companies represented over 90% of new listings in China, and the sector now accounts for more than a quarter of total market capitalisation. In 2025, the MSCI China gained 28%, while the CSI 300 rose 18%. Forecasts suggest further gains in 2026, supported by AI and technology-driven momentum, even though household confidence remains muted. Chinese equities continue to offer diversification benefits, with a reasonably generally constructive macroeconomic backdrop. Chinese sovereign yields are expected to stay range-bound, constrained by disinflationary forces on the upside and a less accommodative monetary stance on the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In South Korea, a significant share of equities continues to trade below book value. Ongoing efforts to improve corporate governance could help unlock value, with Japan’s experience offering potential guide for attracting foreign investment. China’s actions to curb disorderly price competition and address inefficiencies among producers may also support market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Thailand could see further gains in 2026, supported by policies aimed at strengthening domestic demand. Handouts to low-income households and expansionary fiscal measures are expected to bolster consumption and underpin growth in Indonesia. India has also introduced measures to support household spending, including reforms to goods and services taxes. However, Indian equities underperformed other emerging markets in 2025. High valuations, higher-than-expected tariffs, and pressures on the software sector could delay a broader recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Saudi Arabia, despite expectations of softer oil prices, equities may benefit from the potential relaxation of foreign-ownership limits on listed companies. This reform could generate passive inflows estimated at up to $10 billion and may help lift a market that, like India, lagged broader emerging market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, emerging markets are well positioned for 2026. Volatility in developed markets is likely to remain above historical norms, and geopolitical tensions – particularly in the run-up to the US mid-term elections – are expected to persist. Structural trends, including the central role of key Asian economies in global supply chains and the favourable outlook for selected commodities, should continue to support emerging-market performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Legal Disclaimer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Republication or redistribution of LSE Group content is prohibited without our prior written consent.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The content of this publication is for informational purposes only and has no legal effect, does not form part of any contract, does not, and does not seek to constitute advice of any nature and no reliance should be placed upon statements contained herein.

By design, these companies have to depend on external capital to develop (since they have to pay most of what they make as dividends), while the SOFR takes into account much more than just what the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"fed\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">Fed</em> does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see in GLPI's case, their latest debt issuance from back in August 2025 came with coupons of 5.25% ($600 million 2033 notes) and 5.75% ($700 million 2037 notes), and although this pushed their maturities significantly, these are still relatively high yields, while issuing stock still costs about 6.5% nowadays, which limits their ability to deliver significant accretion through investments, with an 8.51% weighted average cap rate they expect on their future pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although we’re talking about a theoretically much more limited and slower growth environment (especially due to the rise of online and potential regulatory limitations), the industry is also facing the trends seen in the country’s general real estate, with the post-pandemic boom in construction now reverting due to weak occupancy rates and rising costs seen all across the board, from workforce and materials to debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, GLPI continues to have a very strong pipeline with attractive cap rates, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">recently highlighting</a> their “$2.6 billion of future capital commitments poised for deployment over the next 24 months,” with mega-projects such as Bally's Lincoln and Chicago, Live!

Jokes aside, iGaming can be a way for traditional operators to not only attract new people and diversify (especially the big players), but also promote their physical operations as needed, although I continue to believe that these companies should focus especially on the experience as a whole. Similarly, GLPI can also expand more into the leisure side, having the capital, size, and experience to develop there as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential issue comes from the weak travel data, with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4539192-online-travel-stocks-slide-on-weak-international-tourism-data\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4539192-online-travel-stocks-slide-on-weak-international-tourism-data\" target=\"_blank\">recent <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">US</em> tourism data</a> highlighting that even though global tourism spending grew by 6.7% in 2025, the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">US</em> actually fell by 6% in terms of foreign visitors and 7% in international tourist spending, likely caused by all the uncertainty around politics, visas, budget issues, etc., although at the same time, <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/domestic-trips-by-us-residents/3672/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/domestic-trips-by-us-residents/3672/\" target=\"_blank\">domestic travel continued to recover</a> to a new record based on recent data.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite their solid position and strong growth pipeline, GLPI will always depend on the economy, and the current environment has plenty of room to get even worse, potentially affecting the company’s tenants, and worsening their ratings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, a higher-for-longer rate environment remains a significant threat for GLPI, potentially limiting the results of their investments and ultimately their valuation, as the market can still find a very solid risk-adjusted yield through treasuries and “tax” the stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"338\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gaming and Leisure Properties IR GLPI stock analysis seekingalpha valuation 2026 best reit stocks to buy vici stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

To elaborate, while the broader memory market will likely only grow at 7% through the next decade, the MRAM market is expected to grow at a pace of 4x more, at +30% levels!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRAM, I feel, will see plenty of takers, as it is something of a disruptor technology that seeks to combine the best of what NAND Flash, SRAM and DRAM have to offer. What if you could have a technology that infuses the cost economics of volatile memory such as DRAM, the superior access speed of another volatile memory-SRAM, and the memory retention capabilities of non-volatile NAND? Semiconductor specialists refer to this as ‘Universal Memory’, and MRAM’s value proposition comes from its ability to harness the unique capabilities of some of the important memory sub-categories. Put simply, you’re looking at a tech that marries the performance of memory with the staying power of storage.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1034\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MRAM Value proposition\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>January 2026 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This seemingly all-in-one facet of MRAM’s technology, enables it to thrive an flourish in a wide array of critical applications that could be subject to high radiation, high temperature</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Is The Next Catalyst For MRAM Stock?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most immediate major catalyst that I see for MRAM is its Q4 and FY results, that will be released on the<a href=\"https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/everspin-announces-date-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 4th of March</a>.

The chart below suggests that MRAM’s revenue growth trajectory tends to move around in cycles (the peak can get to sturdy levels of 80%, while it can also plummet to -40% during down cycles), and we are currently somewhere in the middle.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"647\" data-height=\"438\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, we believe that MRAM is on a long-term journey of reducing lumpy and volatile licensing and royalty fees (which is what mainly causes the spikes and troughs in revenue growth) to that of more consistent “product sales” oriented revenue profile (as of 9M-25<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/29677481\"> 86%</a> of MRAM’s revenue came product sales, and long-term management implied they want to get it to 90% or<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4838875-everspin-technologies-inc-mram-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> just 10%</a> from nonproduct sales).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the gradual shift towards product sales, investors should not be too upset to see MRAM’s gross margin profile continue to trend lower in Q4 and FY25 as a whole. For context, between FY21 and FY24, the gross margin profile contracted by over 800bps, and even as of 9M-25 there was further contraction (to the 51.3%). Investors should also keep in mind that relatively new additions (<a href=\"https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/everspin-expands-high-reliability-mram-portfolio-new-automotive\" rel=\"nofollow\">EM064LX HR and EM128LX HR</a>) to MRAM’s PERSYST EMxxLX family would likely have seen a production ramp up in Q4-25 (ramp up costs of new products typically start at lower initial yields)</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gross margins\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Prepared by the writer using data from the Jan 2026 presentation and 10Q</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market will also be looking to see if MRAM can continue to enhance its collection efficiency on its receivables' portfolio, which would reflect well on the quality of the cash flow that this business is generating. By quality of cash flow, I mean to say that during 9M-24 note that cash generated from receivables was quite minimal at $0.147M, with the adding back of SBC (Stock-based compensation) serving as the overwhelming source of operating cash flows. However, as of 9M-25, SBC expenses were trending lower by 14% at $4.4M and only accounted for 60% of the operating cash flow. A good chunk of the structural cash flow is coming from superior receivable collections, which stood at over $3M!</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"668\" data-height=\"709\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash flow statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"679\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

Despite the uneven markets, Insteel may be in an appealing position for growth as<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> it develops relationships with engineering, procurement, and construction firms developing these large-scale facilities, potentially leading to recurring business over the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, management is reinvesting in operations to optimize production while lowering the cost to produce. Given the strengthening market dynamics, I am upgrading IIIN shares from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4762965-insteel-industries-may-benefit-from-section-232-tariffs\">my previous \"Buy\" rating</a> to a \"Strong Buy\" rating with a price target of $46/share at 8.63x eFY27 EV/aEBITDA.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel Industries Operational Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel’s q1’26 results were underpinned by strong selling prices and volumes offsetting input costs for materials like steel wire rods and scrap steel moving out of inventory, leading to the sequential compression of the gross margin. With steel shipments growing by 3.8% when compared to the previous year, pricing for Insteel’s concrete-enforced products likely drove the 23% year-over-year revenue in q1’26. Accordingly, average selling prices increased by 18.8%, driven by strong demand in the commercial and infrastructure markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though the construction industry is presenting uneven growth dynamics, particularly for residential construction, the industrial data center market remains robust, providing a unique opportunity for Insteel to partner with engineering, procurement, and construction firms for materials sourcing. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\" target=\"_blank\">According to McKinsey</a>, roughly $300<span> billion</span> will be invested for site construction [inclusive of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing] from 2025-2030, creating a massive opportunity for durable growth over the coming years. In addition to constructing the facilities, service roads and supporting infrastructure will need to be constructed, potentially providing additional materials that Insteels can supply. In addition to this, the regionality could potentially drive residential developments to support data center operations, particularly given that sites are being considered in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872782-texas-pacific-land-pivots-towards-long-term-data-center-strategy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872782-texas-pacific-land-pivots-towards-long-term-data-center-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">West Texas in the Midland Basin</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the broad opportunities at hand, Insteel may be limited for growth given domestic production constraints for wire rod following two plant closures in the US. Accordingly, <a href=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/nucor-to-suspend-wire-rod-production-at-connecticut-plant-amid-challenging-market-conditions-1373645.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/nucor-to-suspend-wire-rod-production-at-connecticut-plant-amid-challenging-market-conditions-1373645.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Nucor</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUE\" title=\"Nucor Corporation\">NUE</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/liberty-steel-wire-and-rod-plant-seen-restarting-in-march-pending-financial-arrangements-1366109.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/liberty-steel-wire-and-rod-plant-seen-restarting-in-march-pending-financial-arrangements-1366109.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Steel</a> each idled wire rod rolling mills in the U<span>nited States</span> as a result of challenging economics for the steel products, reducing domestic production by 800,000 tons per year, creating a wider dispersion between demand and domestic supply. This has largely pushed Insteel to augment capacity by importing wire rod, impacting gross margins due to the higher costs to import. Accordingly, this will likely continue through the remainder of eFY26, particularly given the strengthening industrial construction market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another factor that may impact Insteel’s market is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858860-exxon-mobil-2030-plan-more-robust-than-initial-forecast\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858860-exxon-mobil-2030-plan-more-robust-than-initial-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil’s</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) entrance into the building materials industry with Proxxima, a corrosion-resistant, carbon-based material designed as an alternative to rebar. <a href=\"https://www.proxxima.com/en/markets/infrastructure\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.proxxima.com/en/markets/infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">Accordingly, Proxxima</a> is 75% lighter than steel and can be installed 40% faster than steel rebar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Section 232 tariffs imposed in 2025 have resulted in mixed economic factors that have impacted Insteel in recent quarters. From a pricing perspective for PC strand, steel product import restrictions have resulted in stronger pricing power for Insteel, allowing the company to realize substantial price increases for its steel products. On the other hand, import restrictions have impacted material costs for domestically produced wire rod, negatively affecting Insteel’s margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relating to steel tariffs, <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-plans-to-roll-back-some-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-goods-ft-reports/ar-AA1WiY5Y?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-plans-to-roll-back-some-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-goods-ft-reports/ar-AA1WiY5Y?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump</a> has been hinting at the possibility of rolling back certain steel product import tariffs to ease consumer inflationary pressures. This could potentially impact Insteel’s PC strand used in slab-on-grade construction for housing units, though which steel products the president is considering isn’t fully known.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel Industries Financial Position</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to eq2’26, I’m forecasting Insteel to generate $189.6 million in net revenue with a diluted EPS of $0.71/share. My forecast considers pricing dynamics for steel imports and improving operating leverage along with acquisition-related costs rolling off. Overall, I believe the market Insteel participates in is supportive of volume and pricing growth for eFY26, potentially driving another year of strong revenue generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel closed q1’26 with 109 days of inventory on hand, up from 90 days in the prior quarter as a result of higher-cost materials going into inventory. Higher materials costs may have been, in part, impacted by tariff costs on steel product imports, which still remain at 50%. Accordingly, Insteel purchased offshore wire rod in the quarter to offset limited domestic supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the necessary steel imports, Insteel may experience relatively elevated inventory levels until the domestic market normalizes, which may not occur in eFY26. This may result in higher input costs for the time being, given the high import tax, shipment costs, and bulk materials imported to facilitate PC production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel closed q1’26 with $15.6 million in cash &amp; equivalents and no debt on the balance sheet; Insteel has $100 million in available liquidity through its revolving credit facility, providing the firm substantial flexibility to continue to grow through acquisition and reinvestment going forward. As part of Insteel’s capital allocation plan for eFY26, the firm will be investing in its plants to support yields for engineered structural mesh with the intent of reducing production costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Related to Insteel Industries</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Large-scale data center developments may drive multiple verticals for growth, including facility construction, service roads, and potentially surrounding-area residential developments in desolate regions. Despite input cost pressures, Insteel has been successful in dynamically increasing prices for PC strand, offsetting margin risk. Reinvested capital in production may improve operating leverage over time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bear Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Input costs may lead to choppy inventory management and margins for the coming quarters. Exxon’s entrance into the building materials market could potentially impact Insteel’s market long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Shareholder Value</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"176\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"116\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IIIN shares are currently trading at an appealing valuation at 8.49x EV/aEBITDA, creating an appealing buying opportunity for investors seeking to enter into a position.

The markets are full of stories about companies pivoting from<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a cyclical narrative to an AI narrative and since my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846470-cipher-the-silent-winner-of-ai-infra\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">last coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> CIFR is up 21% validating my pivot thesis. Therefore, CIFR remains a strong buy and can easily rerate as hyperscale lease cash flows replace mining volatility.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Bitcoin Cycles to Billion-Dollar Contracts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cipher Digital is no longer a bitcoin mining company. It has made a definitive pivot into a long-duration hyperscale-backed HPC infrastructure platform. The numbers associated with this pivot have now been achieved. The interesting thing about this time is not the narrative progression. It is the visibility of contract economics, capital structure engineering, and scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the heart of this pivot is the <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/797/122797/original.pdf\">300 MW</a> hyperscale facility leased to Amazon Web Services with a 15-year contract with options. The economics associated with this contract alone have $5.5 billion in expected contracted revenue with Amazon’s guarantee of base rent and operating expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economics also have a 100% NOI margin associated with the project level. That means revenue can be immediately turned into operating income before corporate overhead. This is a very different model from the mining business. The contract economics start October 2026. That means the inflection in the business will be seen in the next reporting cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Barber Lake adds another 300 MW of contracted HPC capacity. The combination of Black Pearl and Barber Lake adds 600 MW of HPC capacity versus 207 MW of bitcoin mining capacity. Pro forma, 74% of operating and contracted gross capacity is now HPC. Only 26% is associated with the mining business. The progression of revenue mix is already seen in the capacity allocation.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2174\" data-height=\"1242\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Structure: Aggressive But Structured for Scale</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Cipher’s capital structure is consistent with a thoughtfully designed infrastructure build model.

The acquisition of the 200 MW site in Ohio's Ulysses area via Ulysses further broadens geographical risk profile beyond Texas.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1165\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Construction &amp; Execution Risk: Barber Lake Is On Schedule</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key risk in this valuation thesis is execution risk. The good news is that the construction of the Barber Lake site is reportedly on track. Concrete foundations, steel erection, and underground work are all progressing. All design milestones have been achieved thus far in line with schedule.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874069-cipher-mining-inc-cifr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">secured 95%</a> of long-lead-time equipment necessary for the project which helps remove supply-chain risk. The more important figure is that 100% of workforce requirements for the duration of the project have been secured. In an infrastructure play like this, workforce risk is often the biggest risk to execution. That risk seems to be removed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is reportedly on track to achieve contractual early access and substantial completion milestones. As lease payments do not begin until October 2026, timeline risk is an integral component of this valuation thesis. Construction photos suggest that the project is making material progress rather than just laying groundwork for the facility. That is visible infrastructure being assembled rather than concept drawings. If timelines are adhered to, then the revenue inflection window is now deterministic.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1151\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Pearl Economics: Long-Duration Cash Flow Engine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Black Pearl lease agreement with AWS is a very strong structure. The 15-year lease agreement has 3 options to extend the lease by an additional 5 years. This equates to a 30-year potential revenue visibility. AWS will guarantee the fixed rent as well as operational expense reimbursement. This is a very strong structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At 300 MW gross capacity and $5.5 billion in contracted revenue, this asset alone will reshape the earnings profile of Cipher. Assuming steady-state conversion at levels in-line with the project expectations, the internal return profile will have a very different look and feel from a bitcoin mining profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the inflection point. Once the Black Pearl asset is fully paying the rent, the perception will shift from a crypto-adjacent company to a hyperscale company. This will drive multiple re-rating opportunities.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2170\" data-height=\"1230\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Paying Up for the Growth Curve</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently trading at $17, CIFR is paying up for a hyper-growth infrastructure company. CIFR has a trailing sales multiple of about 27x and a forward sales multiple of about 24x, while sector medians are closer to 3x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these multiples appear rich on an initial glance, consensus revenue growth estimates are expected to turn sharply from 2026’s run-rate of about $228 million to nearly $1 billion in 2027 and $3 billion in 2029. As such, the current premium rapidly compresses based on expected hyperscale scale rather than current mining industry revenue.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The One Risk That Truly Matters: Execution Timing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The one critial risk I see to the investment thesis is the execution timing for Black Pearl and Barber Lake projects. Everything in this valuation hinges on these projects substantially completing and energizing within a specific timeframe. Lease payments are based on these delivery milestones. If energization is delayed by a few quarters, the entire revenue inflection, the entire leverage situation, and the entire market narrative will change in a hurry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is a large-scale data center build and these types of projects are not without variables outside their control, including approvals for interconnection with the electric grid, transformer deliveries, contractor sequencing, and local regulatory approvals. Even with 95% of long-lead equipment deliveries and their workforce locked in, infrastructure projects are not always linear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structural failure is highly unlikely but even minor slippages will put pressure on the shares due to the premium valuation. Timing is everything.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not a speculative mining play trying to understand how to play the adjacency to AI. They have hyperscale leases and they have structured them. They have a multi-year NOI growth story that fundamentally changes their nature as a public entity.</p>",

Since my last coverage, it seems like the market has started to correct what<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> I perceive to be a massive undervaluation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the lows set in November 2025, this <a href=\"https://microcapclub.com/mty-food-group-a-case-study-of-a-100-bagger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://microcapclub.com/mty-food-group-a-case-study-of-a-100-bagger/\" target=\"_blank\">once high-flying stock</a> traded at a P/FCF below 6. A valuation that is usually assigned to companies with high debt, high cyclicality, or a challenged business model. In my opinion, MTY's model isn't broken as it keeps gushing out cash and the market is slowly starting to take notice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846075-mty-food-group-launches-strategic-review-why-shares-could-be-worth-double\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846075-mty-food-group-launches-strategic-review-why-shares-could-be-worth-double\" target=\"_blank\">last write-up</a> three months ago, the total return has been 26.40%. Now trading at a still attractive P/FCF of 7.59 and a 3.57% dividend yield, I believe it's not too late to start investing in MTY.

Instead of boring you with the numbers, let's focus on what I perceive to be the most important metrics for patient, long-term investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY Food Group Q4 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, MTY showed positive net store growth of 19 locations. For the full year, the company grew its store count by one location. It's the first time since 2013 that MTY was able to grow its stores organically on a yearly basis. Given the challenging macro environment, I believe that's a great achievement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Wetzel's Pretzels and Cold Stone Creamery were the main drivers, growing their store counts </span><a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/11.30.2025-MTY-AIF-51-102F2-EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/11.30.2025-MTY-AIF-51-102F2-EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">by 4.79%</a><span> and 9.51% respectively.

That is a CAGR of 10.52%, well above the brand's growth rate before the acquisition. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wetzel's Pretzels has exceeded my expectations as more franchisees are willing to open up new stores. Often, these are <a href=\"https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/flower-mound-highland-village-argyle/dining/2026/01/20/sweetfrog-wetzels-pretzels-co-branded-store-coming-soon-to-flower-mound/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/flower-mound-highland-village-argyle/dining/2026/01/20/sweetfrog-wetzels-pretzels-co-branded-store-coming-soon-to-flower-mound/\" target=\"_blank\">co-branded stores</a> opened by existing franchisees. By offering multiple brands, the stores should attract more customers and generate higher sales, while at the same time cutting down on costs. It's a win-win for both the franchisees and MTY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By having around 90 brands to offer, there's a wide variety that franchisees can add to their existing stores. A competitive advantage that not many other players in the industry can match. On top of that, Wetzel's continues its expansion into <a href=\"https://www.franchising.com/news/20260218_wetzels_pretzels_debuts_first_walmart_location_in_tennessee.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.franchising.com/news/20260218_wetzels_pretzels_debuts_first_walmart_location_in_tennessee.html\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart locations</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">the conference call</a>, the company is in a good position to continue this positive momentum in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is the MTY Model Broken?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY hasn't acquired other businesses since 2022. For most other analysts, this seems to be a sign that the model is broken. After all, the company is a serial acquirer that has completed <a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MTY_IR_Presentation_Q124_April-17-2024.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MTY_IR_Presentation_Q124_April-17-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">over 50 brand</a> acquisitions during the last 26 years. For me, cutting back on acquisitions in this environment is a sign of prudence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Right now, we're living in extraordinary times of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824019-schg-this-is-what-the-final-stages-of-a-bull-market-look-like\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824019-schg-this-is-what-the-final-stages-of-a-bull-market-look-like\" target=\"_blank\">elevated asset prices</a>. MTY historically paid low multiples for its acquisitions, which was the key to its success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company never owned the best brands in the world, but all of its banners <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">are cash flow positive</a>. By paying reasonable valuations and reinvesting the profits, the compounded returns have been staggering for early investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset prices tend to be cyclical. By refraining from overpriced acquisitions now, MTY is lowering its debt and will be able to act whenever better opportunities arise. Despite not acquiring new brands since 2022, the number of locations has remained roughly stable over the last few years.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1032\" data-height=\"624\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Store Count\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"387\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Store Count <span>(MTY: Annual Information Form 2025 )</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">System-wide sales have been flat for the last three years.

The secret lies in its cash-generative business model, as the company primarily collects royalties from its franchisees and acquires brands at attractive valuations. For me, it's the Berkshire Hathaway of restaurant royalties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Same-store sales decreased by 1.7% during the quarter, but it didn't hurt the company's cash generation. I put special emphasis on free cash flow (FCF) and FCF/share. After all, it's the cash that a business generates that funds the dividends, buybacks, and future investments, and pays down debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In previous articles, I labeled <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829593-mty-food-group-cash-flow-king-trading-at-a-cigar-butt-price\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829593-mty-food-group-cash-flow-king-trading-at-a-cigar-butt-price\" target=\"_blank\">MTY as the cash flow king, </a>and the company didn't disappoint.

In 2024, MTY paid exceptionally low income taxes due to <a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11.30.2024-MDA_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11.30.2024-MDA_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">high impairment charges</a> related to Papa Murphy's. If we exclude this, FCF is roughly in line with the year before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF/share came in at CA$5.68 in 2025, which translates to a P/FCF of 7.30 at current prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although not as cheap as it was at the end of last year, MTY remains one of the best bargains in the restaurant industry. This is especially true if we consider the debt levels, which have come down substantially over the last few years and are now approaching more reasonable levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt Levels</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of Q4, the company had net debt of CA$580 million, or a net debt/FCF of 4.44. It's still a bit higher than I'd like, but MTY is making great progress.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Year:</td> <td>2023</td> <td>2024</td> <td>2025</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net Debt: (CA$ million)</td> <td>701</td> <td>654</td> <td>580</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest Expense: (CA$ million)</td> <td>52.1</td> <td>46.5</td> <td>35.0</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt and interest expense are heading in the right direction. MTY raised its <a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260121-MTY-Declares-Its-Quarterly-Dividend.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260121-MTY-Declares-Its-Quarterly-Dividend.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">dividend by 12%</a> this year and now distributes CA$33 million to its shareholders yearly. If we assume CA$130 million in FCF this year, it could lead to ~CA$100 million in further debt reduction this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At CA$480 million in net debt, I'd consider the debt levels as manageable even if the economic outlook were to worsen. This would be below the 4x net debt/FCF ratio that I consider as prudent for a highly cash generative business that is somewhat recession-resistant.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Growth at a Reasonable Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since its first dividend distribution 15 years ago, the payouts have risen at a CAGR of 15.08%. The current dividend yield is 3.57%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY is a highly cash generative business and distributes only 25% of its FCF to shareholders. In my opinion, it's one of the safer and most promising dividend growth plays in the current environment. The hated or overlooked usually make the best investments; it's where others aren't looking that you can find real value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846075-mty-food-group-launches-strategic-review-why-shares-could-be-worth-double\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846075-mty-food-group-launches-strategic-review-why-shares-could-be-worth-double\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a>, I focused extensively on a potential sale of the company. MTY confirmed that they initiated a strategic review and engaged a financial advisor to evaluate potential strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value. Unfortunately, the CEO didn't answer any questions on the strategic review during the latest conference call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are rumors that a competitive bidding war between several groups is ongoing and offers may have climbed to the <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/serruya-private-equity-and-recipe-unlimited-push-mty-food-group-bids-to-c-60-range-ce7e5bddd08ef224\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/serruya-private-equity-and-recipe-unlimited-push-mty-food-group-bids-to-c-60-range-ce7e5bddd08ef224\" target=\"_blank\">CA$60 per share range</a>. If true, it would imply a 45% premium to current share prices, but it would be well below my estimate of MTY's intrinsic value, which I view as around CA$85 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing strategic review reduces the risk of losing money over the short term, but it also lowers the chances of unlocking the true long-term potential of this overlooked compounder.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY had a decent Q4 and fiscal year 2025. The company keeps generating plenty of FCF while investors are waiting for news on the strategic review. Debt levels are coming down, and the business performed well in a rather challenging environment for the restaurant industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the review does not end in a full sale of the company, I expect share repurchases to continue. In that case, MTY could buy back slightly more than 10% of its shares a year at current prices without the need to issue new debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the underlying business would remain stagnant, that'd result in double-digit growth, which is great for a company that's trading at single-digit P/FCF ratios. While no investment is risk-free, I still consider MTY to be one of the better investments in today's exuberant market environment. It offers both long-term potential and a short-term catalyst to unlock shareholder value.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The natural activity of IL-2 is to increase populations of NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumor microenvironments as well as in the peripheral blood.

Mainline biopharma firms with well-known institutional life science venture firms and even strategic investment from major pharmaceutical companies typically command enterprise valuations at IPO of $250 million to $500 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Salspera’s proposed enterprise value at IPO of $859 million, given its thin capitalization, short operating history, small R&amp;D to date, and lack of collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical firms, is simply unsupportable, by a long shot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given these factors, the TKVA IPO represents an extremely high-risk proposition at an unacceptable valuation, so my outlook on it is to sell (avoid it).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expected IPO Pricing Date: To be announced</p>",

Many restaurants have been offering better deals to attract customers, and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> because of its competitors’ discounts, CAVA didn’t perform as well in the second half of 2025 as it did in the first half of the year. CAVA still performed better in Q4 2025 than I expected </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833041-cava-group-is-still-overvalued-if-sales-improve\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">in my previous article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, though. I now think CAVA will report stronger results in 2026, but it still seems like a lot of this restaurant’s growth is priced in already.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4 2025, CAVA reported that its revenue rose 21.2% to $272.8 million. This was mostly because the restaurant group added new locations, because it only reported 0.5% same-store sales growth for the quarter. CAVA also reported that its adjusted EBITDA rose 2.8% to $25.8 million. So, it still looks like this restaurant group is investing most of its profits in new restaurants, and it plans to keep doing that in 2026 as well. CAVA expects to add 74 to 76 restaurants in 2026, and it had 439 restaurants at the end of 2025. So, it’s planning to increase its restaurant count by 17% in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because CAVA is expanding its restaurant count this aggressively, I don’t think it’s appropriate to use the forward P/E ratio for this stock. I think this company’s triple-digit forward P/E is misleading. But CAVA also has a trailing price-to-sales ratio of 7, which is very high for a restaurant. So, this restaurant needs to maintain a very high growth rate to justify its current valuation. And it may not have the pricing power to raise its menu prices right now, so this growth is likely to come from new locations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA Will Limit Its Price Increases in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumers are under pressure right now, so fast-food chains are offering value meals and other deals to consumers who are trading down. Because of this competitive environment, CAVA limited its price increases in 2025, and that’s also why it reported weaker same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter. And it plans to limit its price increases in 2026 as well. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874212-cava-group-inc-cava-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">On the call</a>, CAVA CEO Brett Schulman explained, “Additionally, in January 2026, we implemented an approximate 1.4% in-restaurant menu price adjustment, and we do not plan to take any additional price in 2026.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, CAVA is guiding for same-store sales growth of 3% to 5% in 2026. Because it’s limiting its price increases, it will need more traffic to reach this goal. While the company did achieve 4% same-store sales growth in 2025, this was because it reported strong results in the first half of the year. So, CAVA will have to perform better than it did in the last 2 quarters to meet its guidance. Conservatively, I’d say 3% same-store sales growth in 2026 sounds more likely than a result at the top of the range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA Will Still Grow Rapidly in 2026 Even If Its Same-Store Sales Weaken</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous article about CAVA, I projected that its revenue would grow 18% in 2026. Again, though, this company is now calling for 17% growth in new locations at the midpoint. So, even if CAVA reports 3% same-store sales growth in 2026, it could still perform better than I expected because of the additional revenue from its new restaurants. And it also sounds like its new restaurants are reporting good results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the call, CFO Tricia Tolivar said, “So yes, our -- what we shared when we were on the IPO roadshow was that a new restaurant starts at about $2.3 million in AUV and grows about 10% in year 1. And in fact, over the past 2 years, we've seen those restaurants open much higher than that and experienced, in some markets, a bit of a halo around those openings.” CAVA’s guidance includes the additional revenue growth from recently-added restaurants, and the restaurants it added in 2025 and 2024 have been performing well. So, my revenue growth estimate for CAVA may have been too low, and I’d say 20% growth in 2026 sounds more likely.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Long-Term Investment Thesis for CAVA Is Still Intact</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In theory, CAVA has a stronger moat than other restaurants because there aren’t any other nationwide Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chains. Other fast-casual restaurant chains, such as Chipotle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a>) and Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>), have lots of direct competitors. But CAVA doesn’t have direct competitors with similar scale. This makes CAVA less vulnerable to price competition, because it’s not just competing on price. It can attract consumers who want an alternative to burger restaurants and taco shops.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, CAVA is also attracting long-term investors who aren’t as concerned about its quarterly reports and its quarterly same-store sales growth. They’re interested in the company’s long-term growth prospects. Additionally, CAVA doesn’t just appeal to customers who want Mediterranean food. Like other fast-casual restaurants, it’s positioned as a health-food restaurant. Consumers are still interested in health food, even though they have less money to spend right now. So, CAVA could also report much stronger results if the economy improves in the second half of 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cannibalization Is a Risk Factor</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If CAVA puts new restaurants too close to its older restaurants, the new restaurants could attract consumers away from the older restaurants. If this happens, CAVA’s same-store sales may fall. It doesn’t sound like cannibalization is a problem for CAVA right now, and management didn’t say anything about it on the Q4 call. But if the company adds new restaurants in neighborhoods where it already has restaurants, cannibalization could become a problem in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA’s Stock Price Already Reflects Its Long-Term Growth Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, CAVA’s long-term growth potential is already priced into its stock. After the market close on February 24, CAVA had a forward EV/sales ratio of 6.81. If you compare this valuation to other fast-casual restaurants’ valuations, CAVA looks very expensive. Sweetgreen (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SG\" title=\"Sweetgreen, Inc.\">SG</a>), another “slop bowl” restaurant, has a forward EV/sales of 1.27 right now. Shake Shack has a forward EV/sales of 2.86. And Chipotle has a forward EV/sales of 3.99.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bulls might argue that a premium revenue multiple is justified because of CAVA’s high margins. CAVA is guiding for a restaurant-level profit margin of 23.7% to 24.2% in 2026, so it still has higher profit margins than other restaurants even though it’s limiting its price increases right now. But so do other fast-casual restaurants, and all of these restaurants’ margins are currently under pressure. Even high-income customers are interested in value right now, and they may trade down to restaurants that offer better deals. When a restaurant has much higher margins than its peers, that can also indicate that it’s not offering good deals to its customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Updated Valuation for CAVA</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like I said earlier, I still think CAVA will report higher sales growth than I expected in 2026 because it’s adding so many new locations. And this restaurant group outperformed my estimate for 2025 as well. CAVA’s full-year 2025 revenue was $1.169 billion, which was higher than my estimate of $1.156 billion. So, for fiscal 2026, I’ll project that CAVA’s revenue will rise 20% to $1.403 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA’s TTM EV/sales ratio of 7 is very high for a restaurant, so I’ll also project that this ratio will fall to 6 in 2026. This would give CAVA an EV of $8.418 billion. After subtracting $443 million in debt and adding back $388 million in cash, the Mediterranean restaurant group would have a market cap of $8.363 billion. CAVA also has a diluted share count of 118.4 million shares. Since it will be spending its cash flow on new restaurants, I don’t expect it to buy back stock in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if I divide a market cap of $8.363 billion by 118.4 million shares, I get a one-year target price of $71 per share. CAVA’s current share price is $68 per share, so my target is 4% higher than the current price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It sounds like CAVA’s new restaurants are performing well. I think my previous growth estimate for this company was too low, and it could report 20% revenue growth in 2026. By limiting its menu price increases, CAVA will be able to attract more value-oriented customers. So, I think CAVA will hit its same-store sales growth target in 2026, and it will continue to add new restaurants at a rapid pace as well.

As have many active managers, AB has struggled with weak fund flows as investors increasingly pivot to lower-cost passive products. Still, thanks to a higher market, AUM rose 9% to $867 billion.

In total, the company had $1.3 billion of net inflows, and sales activity has been consistently strong as investors lock in elevated rates. I see some risk of moderating flows this year.

Organic net flows were extremely strong at $8.4 billion, and in Q4, they were $2.1 billion. Revenue per advisor was up 8% to $440k, thanks to a rising market (which mechanistically lifts advisory fees). Thanks to the significant operating leverage of the business, operating margins expanded 410bps to 16.4%. With its acquisition of Stifel’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SF\" title=\"Stifel Financial Corp.\">SF</a>) independent advisory business, we should see substantial growth in 2026.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064366648.png?io=w640\" alt=\"bar chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"509\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064366648.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064366648.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064366648.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Equitable Holdings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, EQH maintains a conservative investment portfolio of $111 billion. The fixed income portfolio has an A2 average rating, and just 2% of the portfolio is below investment grade. Its commercial real estate exposure (“CRE”) is also very high quality, with nearly 2x debt service coverage and just a 66% loan-to-value. While this was previously the primary source of credit concern, those fears have since shifted.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643904417.png?io=w640\" alt=\"pie chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"530\" height=\"344\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643904417.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643904417.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643904417.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Equitable Holdings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">About 16% of its general account portfolio sits in private credit, about half of which is private corporate debt.

I would also note that AllianceBernstein has had 0 net losses over the past 15 years on software private credit; AI could prove to be a total game-changer, but underwriting standards have been historically sound. Management remains comfortable with underlying credit quality here. Frankly, this has been a common theme across the industry, though markets remain cautious about whether this will play out as hoped.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064377583.png?io=w640\" alt=\"pie chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"439\" height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064377583.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064377583.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Equitable Holdings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">90% of its portfolio is underwritten by AB, and as noted earlier, credit records here are solid. The insurance sector is also a long-term investor in private credit. With fixed, long-term liabilities, EQH is a hold-to-maturity investor that can afford less liquidity in its portfolio. Given how much the sector has grown, there will inevitably be some losses, but I do not yet see signs of systemic problems, and EQH’s limited direct lending and software portfolio should position it fairly well. This portfolio requires close monitoring, but as of now, I believe fears are overdone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, one ongoing concern that I have flagged in the past is that EQH has consistently reported mediocre alternative returns. Returns were just 7% in 2025, and 2021 is the only year of the past 7 to really meet its targeted outcome. Given the rate environment and challenges facing private assets, I expect alternative returns to remain below target at least into 2027. This is likely to be a $0.25-$0.45 headwind to EPS relative to what EQH targets from its $3 billion allocation.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643559427_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1022\" data-height=\"310\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643559427_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"bar chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643559427_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643559427_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643559427_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-17720530643559427_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Equitable Holdings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted debt to equity is at 25%, a healthy level, though I do not want to see leverage increase from here. Importantly, the holding company has $1.1 billion of liquid assets, an extremely strong level. This is the entity that pays the dividend and does buybacks. EQH needs no more than $500-$750 million to operate, so there is ample excess liquidity here. Plus, the insurance operating company has a 475% capital ratio, well above the 400% I like to see, leaving excess capital to support growth and dividends to the holding company. Shares offer a 2.6% dividend yield. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 9% from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2026, EQH is targeting $1.8 billion of cash generation while reiterating its $2 billion 2027 target. Mortality trends have been worse than expected, and while its RGA deal reduces mortality exposure by about 75%, this will still be an incremental headwind in 2026. Given the reinsurance deal, it should, however, be less of a drag going forward.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064334447.png?io=w640\" alt=\"bar chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"347\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064334447.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/13071522-1772053064334447.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Equitable Holdings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in December, I saw ~$4.25 of capital returns/share in 2026 on the way to $4.75 in 2027. Given somewhat weaker mortality and potential underperformance from its private portfolio, I am targeting $1.7-$1.75 billion of cash generation. At a 60%-65% payout, that should translate to ~$4.20 of capital returns. This gives EQH a 10+% capital return yield, which strikes me as very attractive. While concerns about private credit exposure may limit multiples, I think it is important to remember that the majority of the company’s capital returns come from its wealth and asset management businesses, which have no real credit risk and are recurring in nature. Plus, EQH has substantial excess capital at both the holding and operating companies, protecting capital returns and the business from higher-than-expected losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I believe fair value is at least an 8% free cash flow yield or above $52. Plus, with the share count likely to be reduced at least 5% this year, we should see capital returns/share rise even if EQH falls short of its $2 billion target. While 2025 EPS disappointed a bit, the pressure from mortality is much smaller given the reinsurance deal and is reflected in my lower cash generation outlook.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decline in the stock strikes me as very exaggerated and is an example of how significant market fears can lead to indiscriminate selling. I would use the weakness to pick up shares, and one positive is that the lower share prices make its buyback program even more powerful. EQH remains a \"Strong Buy\" and one of my preferred names in the sector.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NU\" title=\"Nu Holdings Ltd.\">NU</a></span>) is a rapidly growing fintech company with a bright future that continues to disrupt the Latin American market. However, with the stock trading at a P/B multiple of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> over 7x, investors are vulnerable to downside risks from slowing growth or credit risks.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nu is the <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/a92788ef-9064-8a32-845d-aa71dc6cb506?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">largest</a> private financial institution in Brazil, with around <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/a92788ef-9064-8a32-845d-aa71dc6cb506?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">62%</a> of the adult population as customers. Furthermore, Nubank operates in Mexico and Colombia with the goal of becoming the largest financial institution in Latin America. In January this year, <a href=\"https://international.nubank.com.br/company/nu-secures-approval-to-establish-us-national-bank/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nu announced</a> their expansion to North America, securing approval to establish a US national bank. Management <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/f5a7ffe2-8b17-9d1b-1e9c-e739f5969408?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">divides its products</a> into five divisions: Spending, Saving, Borrowing, Protecting, and Investing. Through the Spending division, likely the largest in terms of revenue and customer base, customers can access a bank account, peer-to-peer money transfers, and the company's core product: the credit card. The Borrowing division lets customers take out a loan, either secured or unsecured. Through Protecting, customers can insure themselves with Chubb. Nu then receives a fee for referring the customer. The Investing division operates similarly to Robinhood in that customers can invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, or fixed-income securities. Lastly, the savings division enables customers to earn interest by lending their money to Nubank through money boxes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This variety of products has led to an extremely successful track record. In just 10 years, <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/f5a7ffe2-8b17-9d1b-1e9c-e739f5969408?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Nu grew</a> from having fewer than 1 million to over <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/a92788ef-9064-8a32-845d-aa71dc6cb506?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">130</a> million customers nowadays.

With a comparable customer base, Mexico's portfolio size doubles that of Brazil, with deposits even three times as high as those of Brazil. Brazilians, in contrast, double the credit card purchase volume of Mexico. Given the comparable markets, I'd argue that the Mexican market approaches saturation once 60% of Mexican adults become customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/63876807-17717383883196917_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"906\" data-height=\"1074\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/63876807-17717383883196917_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ARPAC per cohort\" width=\"640\" height=\"759\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"759\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/63876807-17717383883196917_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/63876807-17717383883196917_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/63876807-17717383883196917_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/63876807-17717383883196917_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q4 2024 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on older cohorts, I would expect ARPAC to grow to around $25 long term. Combining these growth factors creates an opportunity for around $54 billion in revenue, representing 250% growth that is still on the table. This estimate does not include revenue from Colombia or the United States.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Addressing Colombia and the US</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is nothing wrong with the Colombian market itself. However, Nu already generates around <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/8f4616b4-5e08-28bf-68c5-af8e9f03fbcd?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">$15.7 billion in revenue</a>. The Colombian credit card market represents an opportunity of around $7 billion. Basing a growth strategy solely on Colombia is insufficient to meaningfully impact Nu's business and justify future growth projections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, the US, as the biggest country in the world <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">by GDP</a>, is large enough to impact Nu's business. I am not confident that Nu will successfully expand into the US due to competition and business economics. Nu would be competing against well-established banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, American Express, and Citi. Nubank's explosive success in Brazil was driven by the country's high interest rates, which allowed the company to capitalize on <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/71469337-8da5-8862-a913-5da1a0dbe143?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">massive net interest margins</a>. Nubank captured low-cost deposits indexed to the central bank's Selic rate and lent that capital to consumers at significantly higher retail rates. While Nu's net interest margin hovers around 18%, Citi's is just about <a href=\"https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Earnings/Q42025/2025psqtr4rslt.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.5%</a>. Therefore, I would not count on the US market as a source of growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit Risk</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Businesses that lend or borrow money always face credit risk. To measure this risk, <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/a92788ef-9064-8a32-845d-aa71dc6cb506?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nu reports two KPIs</a> that I consider very important. The first is nonperforming loans (NPLs). As of Q4, NPLs recognized as such for 90+ days made up 6% of the entire credit portfolio. Nu could increase revenue growth by offering loans with lower interest rates. However, an increase in credit defaults would be reflected in the 90+ NPL ratio and would therefore decrease the net income margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To offset NPLs, Nu can set money aside to cover these credit losses. The coverage ratio shows how much money Nu has on its balance sheet to make up for credit losses. In Q4, the coverage ratio was around 230%, meaning every lost dollar was backed by $2.30. Generally, the higher the NPL, the more money is needed to make up for these losses. This decreases ROE, since all earned money must go back to increasing the coverage ratio. Thus, it cannot be returned to shareholders or invested in growth.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competition in Mexico</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Nu had a first-mover advantage in Brazil, offering a far superior product to all incumbent banks, the market in Mexico is more competitive. Card transactions are growing rapidly, creating a demand for free, convenient credit cards. Nu has a competitor with a similar offering named MercadoLibre.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies easily beat incumbent banks by offering free credit cards with <a href=\"https://nu.com.mx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">yield rates at 13%</a> and no follow-up costs. However, Nu seems to manage its credit portfolio significantly better. Nu's 90-day <a href=\"https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/59a081d2-0d63-4bb5-b786-4c07ae26bc74/a92788ef-9064-8a32-845d-aa71dc6cb506?origin=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPLs are 6%</a>, covered by 230% cash, while <a href=\"blob:https://investor.mercadolibre.com/60a0fcde-78fd-42a6-a651-667118595a85\" rel=\"nofollow\">MercadoLibre's are 17%</a>, covered by only 140%. Mercado Libre has 90+ day NPLs of 17% and is only covered by 140%, which makes the business more vulnerable. This is not of interest to the end consumer, but it shows that Nu has more of a buffer when expanding. Obviously, neither number is Mexico-specific, but they still display the risk management of both companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Valuation</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I use a DCF model to determine Nu's intrinsic value. Since I disagree with using beta to calculate the cost of equity, I used a 15% discount rate as a hurdle rate. I use net income instead of free cash flow because standard FCF metrics exclude stock-based compensation. Using net income treats SBC as a real expense, accounting for shareholder dilution. I expect net income margins to increase slowly since management has little track record of improving profitability. My growth expectations depend mainly on Brazil and Mexico since Colombia is too small to have a significant impact on growth. The recent US expansion seems ambitious, and I would not rely on them gaining significant market share there since lending money to people is far less risky and therefore far less profitable in the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/63876807-17720824223371654_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"638\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/63876807-17720824223371654_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"272\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/63876807-17720824223371654_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/63876807-17720824223371654_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/63876807-17720824223371654_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/63876807-17720824223371654_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's valuation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After plotting my expectations into my model, I came up with a share price of around $15, which represents a 16% downside from the current price of around $17. This result does not mean that I would sell my stocks at the current price; rather, it suggests that now is not the right time to buy more stocks. The underlying fundamentals and future growth opportunities, especially in Mexico, are great. I believe the market assumes better future margins than I do and therefore arrives at higher prices. In my growth drivers section, I estimated a revenue opportunity of $54 billion. However, to be conservative, I assumed this would not be achieved until 2030.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, I believe Nu is an outstanding business with a great opportunity in Mexico. Their offering, centered on the credit card, provides unusual value to customers through convenience and low costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, lending money always carries the risk of default. So far, measured by NPLs and the coverage ratio, there has been no significant damage to the firm due to defaults. Investors should still be aware, as this could quickly become a serious issue.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price definitely reflects this company's greatness. Based on my realistic future projections, I don't believe Nu will yield 15% or more in the long term, which is why I rate it as a \"hold.\"</p>",
