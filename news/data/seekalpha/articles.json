Going to the cash flow, operating cash amounted to $1.13 billion, with FCF at $523 million. FCF was up +70% quarterly. This was backed by a higher working capital release of $171 million, which offset the higher CAPEX. Diluted EPS came in at $0.47, including impairment and restructuring costs of $65 million.

So, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock attributes 50 basis points of its decline to the value-over-volume strategy. The company is progressing in shutting down production capacity linked to non-performing mills and has already closed three paper mills. Indeed, top management reported: \"further reduction in the number of corrugated loss makers and continuing rationalization of inefficient capacity<em>.\" </em>The adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% is a positive sign. More importantly, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock's adjusted EBITDA accelerated on a quarterly basis, signing a plus +7% versus +3% yearly.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supportive Synergies Ahead</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a negative note, the company reduced its fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $4.9–5.1 billion (compared to a previous indication range of $5-5.2 billion - Fig. 4). This implied an adjusted EBITDA of $1.23 billion in Q4 2025 at the midpoint. Still, the company remains on track to deliver $400 million in synergies. During the analyst's call, top management explained that the cut is related to the weak US demand and higher maintenance ($180-200 million versus last year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1842\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW new guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"215\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW new guidance</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 4</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Footprint As A Key <span>Differentiator</span> </h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a global leader with a footprint in the EU and LatAm, the company benefits from diversification. The company's press release very well supports this: \"We believe we are one of the market leaders in EMEA and APAC, where we have once again demonstrated good returns despite a difficult market backdrop to deliver Adjusted EBITDA of $419 million with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.8%.\" EU mills are operating at a full utilization rate. <span>The company also disclosed its 2026 CAPEX guidance before the year-end. This is unusual, but we see a positive take here. 2026 CAPEX is estimated to be close to consensus guidance at ~$2.4 billion. Still, on a positive note, the company confirmed its quarterly dividend payment of $0.4308 per share (Fig. 5). </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1864\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW Capital allocation priorities\" width=\"640\" height=\"293\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW Capital allocation priorities</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 5</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here at the Lab, we are deliberately not modeling a volume recovery or improved synergies in 2026. We had previously set 2025 EBITDA at $5 billion, which is now consistent with management’s estimates. We were not insensitive to Mondi's profit warning, so we incorporated short-term challenges, but this share price evolution supports doubling down on our entry price. We apply no change to our EV/EBITDA target multiple (8x), so <span></span>Smurfit Westrock's enterprise value reached $40 billion. Our EV/EBITDA is below Packaging Corp. of America's and Smurfit Kappa's valuation before the merger with <span></span>Westrock. Additionally, our target price is below the sector median with a TTM EBITDA of 9.99x (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SW/valuation/metrics\">Fig. 6</a>). Considering the current financial obligation, the company's equity value reached $26.5 billion. This represents approximately a 35% upside. There is also a 4.5% dividend yield, which is a total return estimate of almost 40% in one year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"686\" data-height=\"824\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA Valuation Data\" width=\"640\" height=\"769\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA Valuation Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 6</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is subject to similar risks as the rest of the paper and packaging sector, such as FX changes (which are relevant given Smurfit <span></span>Westrock's US industrial footprint and its euro reporting), declining consumer activity given a potential economic slowdown, COGS price changes (raw materials, energy prices, and chemicals), wage inflation, changes in packaging trends, and overcapacity. Supply-demand imbalance is a common downside risk across the sector. Additionally, given the recent merger, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock is also exposed to integration risks and lower combined synergies. Having said that, the company has a solid track record in M&amp;A.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q3 print and call commentary reinforced our positive thesis. We’re surprised by the adverse share reaction and are upgrading Smurfit to a Strong Buy Recommendation. This call is not only based on a discounted valuation, but rather on the best opportunity to invest in what we consider the best-managed company in the paper sector.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRRM\" title=\"Verra Mobility Corporation\">VRRM</a></span>) previously with a buy rating, as the business outlook remains positive, and given the valuation has become cheaper, I stayed bullish. For this update, I maintain a buy rating. My<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> view is still that this is a strong, well-managed business that is seeing fundamentals improving. VRRM has won the NYCDOT contract, which removes a huge uncertainty in the equity story. With new potential growth levers like new legislation changes in California, I would think VRRM is still in very good shape to grow for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3Q25 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285135-verra-mobility-announces-third-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025</a> results were very strong. VRRM’s total revenue grew 16% y/y to $262 million, coming in way ahead of consensus. The beat was almost entirely driven by Government Solutions [GS], which saw 28% y/y growth. The key catalyst was the timing and pull-forward of the New York City contract. In Q3, VRRM booked $17 million of revenue tied to a New York City Department of Transportation [NYCDOT] change order to install up to 250 additional red-light cameras in 2025. In that $17 million, it included $6 million from product sales. Remember that I’ve discussed this previously, noting this as a growth catalyst. It has surely played out nicely and as expected. For the Commercial Services [CS] segment, revenue grew 7% y/y to $117.3 million. The 3% decline in Fleet Management [FMC] was expected, as the customer churn was already disclosed in Q2 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of profit, adj. EBITDA grew 8% y/y to $113 million. This was below revenue growth because of one-time readiness costs tied to the NYC expansion. Some of the major cost items include developing a real-time camera health dashboard, cloud migration, and getting more subcontractor capacity onboard. These are necessary upfront investments to make sure VRRM is ready to win demand (like the $963 million contract opportunity), and hence, they shouldn’t be considered as recurring costs. Anyway, despite the heavier spend, adj. EPS still grew 16% y/y to $0.37.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The NYC Overhang Is Gone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outcome of the NYCDOT RFP was a very bullish moment for VRRM’s equity story. As I said before, this was an important growth catalyst, which could also be seen as an overhang (investors don’t like uncertainty). Thankfully, that uncertainty is now gone, and VRRM has been officially awarded the contract. What makes this even better than it seems is that this is not just a simple renewal. It is actually a large expansion contract with multi-year visibility. Here are the terms of the deal: the VRRM contract is on a five-year term with a five-year renewal option. In other words, VRRM has effectively locked in its largest customer for potentially a decade. The total estimated value for the initial term alone is $963 million. For perspective, VRRM's entire FY2024 revenue is only $879 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The scope of this deal is also very positive for VRRM. It includes the sale and installation of ~1,000 additional red-light and fixed bus-lane cameras over the next 2+ years. This matters for two reasons. First, it gives VRRM a sizeable sum of front-loaded, high-margin product revenue (NYCDOT has chosen to purchase the equipment directly from VRRM), which management expects will contribute $20 million to $30 million in product revenue in both 2026 and 2027. Second, and more importantly, this permanently expands the VRRM recurring revenue base. Each of these 1,000 cameras represents a long-term service stream that generates visible, high-margin revenue. Basically, the installed base has gotten significantly larger, and a larger installed base means more recurring revenue. Given this win, I think the GS segment can very easily grow high-single-digit to low-double-digit service revenue through the foreseeable future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Execution, Balance Sheet, And Growth Momentum</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond the NYC contract win, the rest of VRRM business continues to execute exceptionally well too. The CS segment continues to operate steadily, maintaining its status as the cash-generative engine for VRRM. In Q3, revenue grew 7% y/y, supported by a 7% increase in rental-car tolling activity. The key data point here is that TSA passenger traffic grew by only 1% in Q3, which means the growth was not a boost from higher travel-related passengers. This reliable cash flow provides VRRM the flexibility to deleverage quickly (net leverage is now down to just 2x). On this balance sheet topic, management has refinanced the term loan, extending its maturity by seven years to 2032 and cutting the spread by 25 bps. The focus here on balance sheet matters to some extent because the NYC contract win is good, but it requires heavy investments. The last thing we want to see is VRRM being put in a difficult position where it needs to raise debt or equity to fund this growth capex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth momentum in GS, which I highlighted in my last update, is also accelerating. Specifically, for California’s speed camera program, which was still in its six-city pilot phase previously, VRRM has won its third award, with San Jose confirming its intent to award. With this win, it marks VRRM's third win following the deals in San Francisco and Oakland. You can start to see this trend forming nicely, that as VRRM wins more deals, it makes it more credible in the industry. Every win becomes a reference point for the next deal. I would love to think that this is the case, and if true, we should continue to see VRRM winning deals on this front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Winning these deals is not just good for the financial benefits, but also because VRRM gains a “priority” seat when it comes to more services needed. Take the recent California legislation, for instance. The new legislation doesn’t just require a new work-zone speed pilot but also a complete restructuring of California’s red-light program, moving it from criminal to civil enforcement. This is huge because the 'criminal' term was a major operating barrier; in a sense, it was a political headache for cities to adopt due to high fines and the related legal process for drivers. This new change shifts the status from criminal to a simple civil penalty (just think of this like a parking ticket). This makes the program far easier to adopt for municipalities (they don’t need to go through the high hurdles of passing a “criminal law”), and this, in my view, should significantly accelerate adoption. For VRRM, because it is already in contract with California, it should naturally be the vendor of choice.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"403\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A white sheet with numbers and a number on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>May Investing Ideas</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My updated model still suggests attractive upside for VRRM. My growth assumptions are the same: that revenue growth should continue to compound at a high single-digit percentage given the new NYC contract win and expanding opportunities in California and potentially other states. In fact, my growth assumption may be too low, but for conservatism's sake, I will stick to 8%. I have delayed VRRM achieving a 25% adj. earnings margin by 1 year to FY28 to reflect the heavy investments required for the NYC deal. One new change to the model is I am pricing in share buybacks. So far into FY2025, VRRM has already bought back 3% of shares, and I assume this to continue as VRRM has the balance sheet strength to continue. This gives us an FY28 adj. EPS of $2.05. Multiplying that by 18x forward PE (VRRM historical average multiple), I think VRRM shares can be worth $37 by FY2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk is from the front-loaded margin pressure from the new NYC contract. Management expects to see some margin pressure in 2026, and should the required expenses go beyond expectations, the unit economics of this contract may not be as lucrative. The deal also increases customer concentration risk. In Q3 2025, NYCDOT accounted for 19.5% of total revenue, and the top three CS clients represented more than 38%. Should any of them churn, for any reason, it would be detrimental for VRRM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I reiterate a buy rating for VRRM. I believe VRRM’s fundamentals have gotten a lot better after the NYC contract award, one that enables it to lock in its largest customer for the next decade. The balance sheet is stronger, cash flow remains robust, and new legislative tailwinds are potentially expanding VRRM’s addressable market. While 2026 will see near-term margin pressure from upfront costs, I believe these investments will support higher growth and profitability in 2027 and beyond.</p>",

And I expect its margins to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> grow faster than analysts expect, which means that the stock is potentially undervalued based on earnings multiples. Additionally, BJ’s can use its increased income to drive EPS growth in other ways, such as stock buybacks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I discussed this thesis in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816157-bjs-restaurants-might-become-more-efficient-than-analysts-expect\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816157-bjs-restaurants-might-become-more-efficient-than-analysts-expect\" target=\"_blank\">my previous article about BJ’s</a>, but my call may have been too early. I recommended buying the stock at $35 per share in August, and its closing price on October 30 was $29. It appears that investors liked the third-quarter report, and after it came out, BJ’s stock price rose to $31 in post-market trading. But it might still take more time for this stock to rise back to $35.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287298-bj-s-restaurants-inc-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287298-bj-s-restaurants-inc-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">its third-quarter report</a>, BJ’s reported 0.5% same-store sales growth and 1.4% overall revenue growth. It also reported $330.2 million in revenue and $0.04 in adjusted diluted EPS. It’s maintaining its guidance for 2% same-store sales growth for the full year of 2025, and early fourth-quarter trends are promising. Its third-quarter results were weaker than expected, but the restaurant does have a good explanation for this. It was facing tougher comps because of the launch of the Pizookie Meal Deal last year. But first, I’ll take a look at BJ’s margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s Margins Are Still Growing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My investment thesis for BJ’s depends on margin expansion, and BJ’s did report additional margin growth during the third quarter. Its restaurant-level operating margin rose from 11.7% in the third quarter of 2024 to 12.5% in the third quarter of 2025. Its adjusted EBITDA margin also improved to 6.4% in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The restaurant’s unadjusted bottom-line results also improved. It posted an unadjusted loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, and an unadjusted profit of $465 million in the third quarter of 2025. It was only able to post positive GAAP net income because of tax benefits, though. It reported an EBIT of -$999 million. Either way, BJ’s is becoming more efficient right now, so that part of the thesis still holds up.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year 2025 Forecast</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s maintained its guidance for 2% same-store sales growth for the full year in the earnings report, but didn’t provide overall revenue guidance. Because the company’s revenue growth as a whole has been slightly higher than its same-store sales growth, I’d estimate that its full-year revenue could rise 3% to $1.398 billion for the full year of 2025. I don’t expect it to add any new locations in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the third-quarter earnings report, BJ’s said that its revenue for the first <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">three</em> quarters of 2025 was $1.044 billion. So, using the company’s full-year guidance, I can estimate that its fourth-quarter 2025 revenue will be $354 million. Its guidance also called for $136 million in full-year adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint, and with $1.398 billion in revenue, that’s a 9.7% margin. So, with $354 million in revenue, its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA would be $34 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pizookies Are Still The Growth Driver for BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While BJ’s posted weaker top-line results this quarter, this wasn’t just because of economic weakness. <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/10/bjs-restaurant-launches-a-13-pizookie-meal-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/10/bjs-restaurant-launches-a-13-pizookie-meal-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">BJ’s introduced the Pizookie Meal Deal</a> in the third quarter of 2024, so it was facing a tougher-than-usual comparison. This $13 lunch deal includes both an entree and a Pizookie, a cookie topped with ice cream. And it’s the reason why BJ’s still has positive traffic growth right now. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BJRI/earnings/BJRI-Q3-2025-earnings_call-369389.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BJRI/earnings/BJRI-Q3-2025-earnings_call-369389.html\" target=\"_blank\">On the call</a>, management said that traffic growth drove the restaurant’s same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Its average check size isn’t increasing and might have dropped a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This restaurant also offers seasonal Pizookie treats, such as <a href=\"https://www.brandeating.com/2025/09/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-2025-halloween-menu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.brandeating.com/2025/09/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-2025-halloween-menu.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Spooky Pizookie</a>, which was originally introduced in 2023 and has now been brought back for 2025. On the call, management also said that BJ’s has more seasonal Pizookies coming up in the fourth quarter, including the Monkey Bread Pizookie and a new Dubai Chocolate Pizookie.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling Alcohol Demand Is Still a Risk for BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like other restaurants, BJ’s has raised its prices in 2025. In the third quarter, its prices were up 2% in comparison to last year. But that didn’t translate into growth in average check size, and one reason for that was because consumers ordered fewer alcoholic beverages. In my previous article, I mentioned that many younger consumers were avoiding alcohol and ordering treats like cookies instead, and that hasn't changed. BJ’s has an on-trend alternative with its Pizookies, but falling demand for alcohol is still a risk factor for the restaurant.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Scheduling Software Has Not Been Fully Rolled Out Yet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article about BJ’s Restaurants, I explained that the company was using AI scheduling software to reduce its labor costs. It’s using AI to forecast traffic and then using these forecasts to create schedules for its employees. In addition to reducing costs, the AI software could also deliver incremental revenue growth because the restaurant will be able to schedule more employees during peak hours.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this software has already helped BJ’s become more efficient, the company hasn’t fully rolled out this AI scheduling software yet. <span>M</span>anagement explained that 30% of BJ’s locations would be using the software by the end of 2025. So this software isn’t just driving current margin expansion, it’s also likely to produce additional margin growth in 2026 as it gets installed at more restaurants.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Updated Valuation For BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I used a different valuation method for BJ’s in my previous article than I’ve been using in my more recent articles. So, in this article, I’ll also recalculate what I expect its share price to be in 2026. Earlier in this article, I estimated that BJ’s would report $1.398 billion in revenue for the full year of 2025. It guided for $136 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 9.7% adjusted EBITDA margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It sounds like the third quarter’s results were weaker than usual because of last year’s Pizookie Meal Deal launch, and preliminary fourth-quarter results are better. So I’ll project that BJ’s reports 2% same-store sales growth and 3% overall revenue growth in 2026. BJ’s has around 200 restaurants right now. On the call, management said that BJ’s might add <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">two</em> new locations in the second half of 2026, so I’d also add 0.5% revenue growth because of that factor. With 3.5% revenue growth in 2026, BJ’s revenue would rise to $1.447 billion. And with a 9.7% EBITDA margin, its EBITDA would be $140 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the market close on October 30, but before its post-market rally after earnings came out, BJ’s had a forward EV/EBITDA of 8.31. This was below the 10.39 median for the consumer discretionary sector. If BJ’s had a 2026 EV/EBITDA of 9 and an EBITDA of $140 million, its EV would be $1.26 billion. If you subtract $478 million in debt and add $26 million in cash, its market cap would be $808 million in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s has also reduced its diluted share count from 23.8 million to 23.4 million this year with share buybacks, and it’s planning to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">buy</em> back more shares. So I’d estimate that it will have 23.0 million shares in 2026. With a market cap of $808 million and 23.0 million shares, my new target price for BJ’s would be $35 per share in 2026. On October 30, its closing price was $29 per share, but its post-market price after its earnings report came out was $31 per share. So, my target price is 13% higher than the post-market price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s still has several growth drivers, such as its Pizookie Meal Deal and its limited-time, seasonal Pizookies. And it did face tougher comps this quarter. So, I think it will still report rising sales in 2026, but might not grow as fast as I originally expected, and that means its earnings won’t grow as fast as I expected either. Additionally, I also changed the valuation method I was using since I wrote my last article on BJ’s, but its stock price has fallen since then as well. At a price of $31, I still think it’s a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">buy</em>.</p>",

The increasing demand for quick and easy credit created a lending industry characterized by fraudulent operators and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> questionable business practices. Years of regulation — which ultimately led to the shutdown of P2P lending in 2021 — forced existing players to change their business models substantially.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN and FINV are now among the largest fintech players in China. And although they both focus on technology-enabled finance, they followed quite divergent paths after the mentioned crackdown. QFIN rebuilt around bank-partnered loan facilitation and technology services, whereas FINV moved toward capital-light, fee-based services with a strong focus on international expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, both companies still generate most of their revenues in China and are therefore heavily dependent on its macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Recently, they were once again affected by new regulatory guidelines for internet-based lending practices. The regulation led to softer company outlooks for H2 2025, followed by sharp declines in share prices. This shift in momentum and slight adjustment to EPS revisions led to a downgrade in their Quant ratings — from Strong Buy to Hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At today's depressed valuations, both companies again appear heavily undervalued. In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824517-qfin-holdings-highly-profitable-fintech-trading-at-discount-valuation\">recent analysis on QFIN</a>, I already concluded that strong shareholder returns and an incredibly cheap valuation make the company an attractive buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this analysis, I want to closely compare both companies' business models, operating efficiency, growth, and risk structures — to identify which is the better buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Models – Different Paths to Success</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business model of QFIN and FINV is to leverage big data and AI in the financial industry. Both companies are specifically focused on developing products in the lending industry. Their products aim to improve the safety, efficiency, and speed of online lending, covering the whole loan lifecycle, including credit and risk rating, loan pricing, fraud detection, and post-loan management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV operates as a hybrid fintech lender, primarily earning revenue from loan facilitation (matching borrowers with partner banks) &amp; service fees, guarantees, and net interest income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A small portion of FINV's loan volume is held on its own balance sheet. By doing this, the company is taking the full loan risk in exchange for the whole net interest income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN also acts as a loan facilitator, earning commissions and service fees. QFIN funds its loans through partner banks, trust investors, or its own capital. It also acts as a guarantor and runs a credit matching platform, connecting borrowers with its partner banks. Further revenue streams are referral fees and technology services. QFIN's management team considers these services an important driver of future capital-light revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"796\" data-height=\"231\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table of revenue mix based on Q2 2025 data\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">revenue mix based on Q2 2025 data <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A closer look at the most recent revenue breakdown shows how differently QFIN and FINV generate their income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's revenue is driven by net interest income — accounting for 42.3% — showing that a significant portion of revenue still comes from interest-bearing activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV's top line relies mainly on loan facilitation and guarantee income (together 71.7%), confirming its fee-based, capital-light model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Referral and post-facilitation fees are stronger for QFIN than for FINV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies generate a similar share of other and tech-related revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, QFIN's model appears more interest-driven and vertically integrated, while FINV's focus lies in diversifying its service-oriented business horizontally.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Metrics</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The borrower profiles of both companies show some overlap.

Despite similar borrower counts and growth, and smaller average loan sizes, QFIN generates higher loan volumes and outstanding balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV's larger but shorter loans generate less cumulative loan activity per borrower, resulting in lower total loan volumes and balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since financial partners fund loan volume, the idea is simple: the more loan volume they facilitate, the more fee income they generate. QFIN's stronger borrower engagement results in lower user acquisition costs, demonstrating its superior operational efficiency compared to FINV.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographic &amp; Strategic Focus</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN focuses on deepening its operations in China, whereas FINV is following a plan of geographic diversification. 21% of FINV's revenue comes from international operations in Southeast Asian markets, whereas QFIN is still entirely dependent on its revenues from China. However, QFIN recently initiated its international expansion with a pilot project in the U.K. Although the management team recently emphasized its strong commitment to global expansion, it still sees significant opportunities in its local market.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We believe the robust fintech infrastructure this market offers presents significant opportunities for us and are confident that our AI and big data capabilities will create substantial value by addressing underserved local demand.

FINV's entrance into new markets drives strong revenue accretion at the cost of earnings quality. QFIN, on the other hand, prioritizes efficient and stable cash generation over aggressive expansion, which it then returns to its shareholders through its massive repurchase programs, leading to strong shareholder returns and EPS accretion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, FINV's growth optionality appears more tangible, as they have already advanced in their international expansion and recently surpassed an international revenue share of 20%. QFIN, in contrast, hasn't yet captured international markets, and technology services haven't yet contributed significantly to revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV's growth strategy comes with higher execution risk due to the exposure to different legal frameworks, a higher fixed cost structure, and a lower borrower quality. However, it likely comes with a bigger long-term potential, as it gives access to high-growth markets, characterized by low fintech penetration rates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table of profitability metrics\" width=\"602\" height=\"325\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"602\" data-height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618798477462986.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">profitability metrics <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's margins have been consistently stronger than FINV's.

Although this is not fully verifiable, as QFIN isn't disclosing the financial impact of R&amp;D in its income statements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth, and certainly the most significant impact on cost efficiency, is the difference in how the companies handle loan risks. FINV provides guarantees to partner banks through its \"Quality Assurance (QA)\" system. The guarantees require FINV to deposit funds with its partner banks, making sure potential loan losses are covered. Meaning, each guarantee involves real cash outflow, binding FINV's liquidity until loans mature. Additionally, FINV needs to make provisions for further potential loan losses. These two positions account for 27.6% and 5.7% of its revenue. Presumably, FINV follows the practice of larger securities, as it helps the company to build and expand relationships with its financial partners quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's outstanding efficiency stems from the fact that it solely manages loan risks by making provisions, representing 25.3% of its revenues. Unlike FINV, QFIN doesn't deposit collateral to partner banks. Instead, they are utilizing non-cash provisions, which don't require upfront payments. Cash payments are only required if loan defaults are realized, providing more liquidity to QFIN.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV records substantially higher QA and provision expenses, reflecting a more risk-intensive business model.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Efficiency</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table on operating cash flow conversion data\" width=\"532\" height=\"218\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"532\" data-height=\"218\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">operating cash flow conversion <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That also explains why QFIN is doing much better in converting operating income into operating cash flow. Both companies earn income from guarantees and net interest, but FINV consumes far more liquidity to secure it. While QFIN manages credit risk through non-cash provisions that are later released, FINV relies primarily on QA, which requires cash deposits and guarantee payments. As a result, QFIN's operating cash flows remain stable, whereas FINV's fluctuate more.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Management</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table of risk metrics\" width=\"603\" height=\"108\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"603\" data-height=\"108\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">risk metrics <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies maintained excellent risk management over the last years, despite the challenging macroeconomic and regulatory environment. The credit performance of FINV and QFIN remained very stable and almost identical.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet &amp; Shareholder Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies maintain healthy balance sheets. QFIN has moderate leverage, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 28%, compared to FINV's extremely low ratio of 7%. QFIN's higher leverage is offset by its more stable cash generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies pay semi-annual dividends and have a history of increasing them. As of today, FINV's FWD dividend yield amounts to 4.7%, compared to 6.8% for QFIN. FINV's payout ratio is historically a bit lower, offset by a more stable dividend growth record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to dividends, FINV and QFIN have consistently returned shareholder value in the past through buybacks. In H1 2025, FINV has repurchased 2.4% of its outstanding shares, compared to 8.4% for QFIN. Both companies have already authorized, but unused, share repurchase volume. Even though FINV is already returning a significant amount of generated cash to its shareholders, QFIN's share repurchase program is even more remarkable. In fact, the company currently has two active buyback programs. A regular one, and an extraordinary one, funded by issuance of convertible senior notes at an extremely low-interest rate of 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If FINV were to utilize its remaining share repurchase volume of $89.3 million, the company could retire 12.75 to 14.9 million shares, assuming an average repurchase price of $6.00 to $7.00 per share. This would represent a buyback yield of 5.0 to 5.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w640\" alt=\"graphic on QFINs share repurchases\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"528\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QFIN share repurchases <span>(Q2 2025 earnings presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN, on the other hand, still has $623 million in already authorized, but unused share repurchase volume. Meaning the company could retire around 25 to 30 million shares, assuming an average repurchase price of $25.00 to $30.00 per share. This would represent a buyback yield of 14.8 to 17.7%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When combining dividends and share repurchases, FINV currently offers a YTD 2025 total shareholder yield of 7.1%. If buybacks were fully utilized, total shareholder yield would reach 12.1 to 13.0%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN currently offers a YTD 2025 total shareholder yield of 15.2%. If buybacks were fully utilized, total shareholder yield would reach 29.1 to 32.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today's depressed valuations, operational strength, and clean balance sheets allow both companies to return capital at double-digit yields. QFIN's rate of capital return is unique and represents an exceptional margin of safety for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies trade at extremely low multiples. QFIN is cheaper than FINV on key metrics such as P/E and P/OCF. Despite its excellent cash flow generation and shareholder returns, QFIN only trades at 1.9x its cash flows compared to 4.8x for FINV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table of valuation metrics\" width=\"607\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"607\" data-height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">valuation metrics <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies are heavily discounted vs. their sector, with discounts ranging from 50 to 90% (see data for <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FINV/valuation/metrics\">FINV</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QFIN/valuation/metrics\">QFIN</a>), showcasing the reluctance towards investments in China. Although, even by comparing the valuation metrics against their 5-year averages, both companies clearly show signs of undervaluation.

While the financial performance has been solid over the last years, new regulations and macroeconomic headwinds could continue to affect revenues and margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI-driven risk models heavily rely on data inputs. Any tightening of data privacy regulations could harm the companies' underwriting quality.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Specific Risks</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV faces a broader range of risks, as part of its revenue comes from international operations, which introduce FX and country-specific risks. FINV's focus on younger, first-time borrowers might entail higher risks in the future. The diversification helps FINV to reduce its dependency on China. But it also causes bigger operational costs, which, along with the cash-heavy guarantees, lead to inferior operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN, in contrast, operates almost entirely in China, making the company fully dependent on domestic regulatory changes. QFIN's income is heavily reliant on net interest income from bank-funding partnerships, making it more sensitive to interest rate changes.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Annual Percentage Rate (APR) CAP reduction</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Any shifts, such as the recently widely discussed reduction of maximum APR in China from 24 to 20%, would significantly harm QFIN. All future loans of QFIN would be affected, whereas FINV's international expansion would partly reduce the impact. Lower APRs would compress margins across all consumer loans. Both companies would likely need to tighten their credit risk standards, leading to a contraction in loan volume. Since FINV caters to a riskier borrower group, which is priced at higher average APRs, an APR cap reduction from 24 to 20% would exclude a larger share of existing borrowers than in QFIN. Given that FINV is already operating at tighter margins than QFIN, I believe FINV would experience greater margin pressure in such a scenario. QFIN, on the other hand, might take a bigger revenue hit, as it relies more on net interest income. However, given its strong margins and diversification of revenue mix, I believe its business model would once again be able to overcome these challenges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, it's important to note that only a portion of the loan volume would be affected by the lower ARP cap. QFIN and FINV cooperate with large, regulated financial institutions that likely do not price their loans at the upper limit of 24%, especially for prime and near-prime borrowers. While it's impossible to model the effect of such a scenario — as too much information is missing — I believe negative EPS effects would be at least partly absorbed through future efficiency gains, buybacks, and restructuring of the competitive landscape.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaway - which is the better stock to buy?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's business model is characterized by remarkable efficiency, profitability, and cash flow generation. The company leverages its repeat borrower base and deep relationships with local financial institutions, allowing predictable revenues and integration of technological products into its ecosystem. A total shareholder yield of more than 15% and a dirt-cheap valuation relative to the sector and its own past offer a significant margin of safety in an uncertain environment. The stock has plenty of room to rerate back to higher multiples, more in line with historical averages. In the meantime, investors are generously paid to wait. Given the share price drop of 30% from my previous article on QFIN, I now upgrade my rating to a Strong Buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV also represents a fundamentally strong company with a bulletproof balance sheet. The company is consistently growing its top line, supported by its international expansion in high-growth, low-penetration markets. Although its operating margins are improving, cash-backed QA ties up liquidity, turning its 'capital-light' revenues into an actual capital-heavy business. This represents a major difference compared to QFIN's cash-efficient provisions, leading to larger cash flow fluctuations and a lower ability to return capital to shareholders. Nevertheless, given the amount of cash sitting on FINV's balance sheet, I expect more aggressive buybacks in the future. Lastly, FINV's valuation is clearly attractive, but it doesn't offer the same degree of deep discount as QFIN. FINV's history of lower margins, shareholder returns, and a higher valuation suggests a narrower margin of safety, making the stock a more speculative buy currently. Still, for long-term investors — if FINV executes its expansion correctly — the stock offers geographic diversification into attractive markets, reducing dependence on China's environment. I therefore assign a cautious long-term buy rating. More short-sighted investors should wait for catalysts, such as margin improvements, a lighter QA system, an increase in the buyback program, or important macroeconomic changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I generally like FINV, and I also own shares of the company. But, based on my understanding of both companies, I believe QFIN is currently the better and less risky investment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXTI\" title=\"AXT, Inc.\">AXTI</a></span>) reported Q3<span></span> 2025 results yesterday after market. The company’s stock price rallied on higher revenue, decreasing net loss, and positive forward outlook.

Gross margin was 22.4%, compared to 8.2% QoQ and 24.3% YoY. Gross profit was $6.2 million, representing a 343% increase QoQ and a 9% increase YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue by channel was as follows. Indium phosphide was $13.1 million, driven by data centers and PON. Revenue for indium phosphide increased more than 250% QoQ and represents a three-year high. The increase is due to the company finally receiving its export permits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gallium arsenide revenue was $7.5 million, representing a 20% increase QoQ. The company attributed it to higher demand for semi-insulating wafers used in wireless RF devices. Revenue from germanium substrates was $640k. The company’s raw material joint venture earned $6.7 million in revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company shared a breakdown of revenue by geography and customer profile. Asia Pacific amounted to 87%. Europe represented 12%. North America made up 1% of revenue. Five large customers made up 45.2% of revenue, and two large customers made up more than 10% of revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses were $6.7 million, a decrease QoQ and YoY. Operating loss was $384K compared to a loss of $6.1 million QoQ and a loss of $2.6 million YoY. Net loss was $1.2 million compared to a net loss of $6.4 million QoQ and $2.1 million YoY. Cash and cash equivalents were $31.2 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company forecasts strong Q4 results. It expects Q4 revenue between $27 million and $30 million. AXT will fulfill more of its backlog for indium phosphide and gallium arsenide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current backlog for indium phosphide is $49 million. Market consensus for Q4 revenue is $27.5 million. The company will report in February.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Synergies</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data center applications and AI computing are driving higher demand for indium phosphide. Indium phosphide-based lasers and detectors for high-speed optical connectivity are also driving demand. The company saw historically high revenue for indium phosphide in Q3. The current process for receiving indium phosphide export permits is three months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s raw materials joint venture reported nominal growth for the quarter. The company reports that new Tier 1 customers are considering their materials for their supply chains. AXT admits that it is a difficult path to navigate for a company to source its materials. AXT says that it is well-positioned to facilitate demand and supply chain issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company foresees increasing demand for its materials due to “massive AI infrastructure build-out” and “data center build-out” in the US and China. It believes that US hyperscalers are using its materials in their data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important current synergy for the company is the possibility of it fulfilling its backlog and gaining export permits for Q4.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXTI Stock - Historical Financial Performance and Valuation</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Amounts in US$ millions*</p></td> <td><p>Q3<span></span> 2025</p></td> <td><p>Q2<span></span> 2025</p></td> <td><p>Q1<span></span> 2025</p></td> <td><p>Q4<span></span> 2024</p></td> <td><p>Q3<span></span> 2024</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenues</p></td> <td><p>28.0</p></td> <td><p>18.0</p></td> <td><p>19.4</p></td> <td><p>25.1</p></td> <td><p>23.6</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cost of Revenues</p></td> <td><p>21.8</p></td> <td><p>16.5</p></td> <td><p>20.6</p></td> <td><p>20.7</p></td> <td><p>18.0</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>6.2</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> <td><p>(1.2)</p></td> <td><p>4.4</p></td> <td><p>5.7</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Operating Expenses</p></td> <td><p>7.3</p></td> <td><p>8.2</p></td> <td><p>9.0</p></td> <td><p>10.6</p></td> <td><p>9.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Income</p></td> <td><p>(0.4)</p></td> <td><p>(6.7)</p></td> <td><p>(10.3)</p></td> <td><p>(6.2)</p></td> <td><p>(3.4)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>(1.2)</p></td> <td><p>(7.0)</p></td> <td><p>(8.8)</p></td> <td><p>(5.1)</p></td> <td><p>(2.9)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash &amp; ST Investments</p></td> <td><p>31.2</p></td> <td><p>27.0</p></td> <td><p>31.6</p></td> <td><p>22.8</p></td> <td><p>24.9</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Receivables</p></td> <td><p>33.8</p></td> <td><p>22.8</p></td> <td><p>22.9</p></td> <td><p>25.6</p></td> <td><p>28.0</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Assets</p></td> <td><p>149.8</p></td> <td><p>145.0</p></td> <td><p>149.5</p></td> <td><p>158.3</p></td> <td><p>167.9</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Assets</p></td> <td><p>334.0</p></td> <td><p>329.0</p></td> <td><p>333.5</p></td> <td><p>339.3</p></td> <td><p>355.6</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Accounts Payable</p></td> <td><p>10.8</p></td> <td><p>11.2</p></td> <td><p>11.1</p></td> <td><p>12.4</p></td> <td><p>12.8</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>84.9</p></td> <td><p>79.5</p></td> <td><p>75.3</p></td> <td><p>74.2</p></td> <td><p>78.8</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>93.6</p></td> <td><p>88.4</p></td> <td><p>87.3</p></td> <td><p>84.4</p></td> <td><p>89.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Book Value Per Share</p></td> <td><p>$4.00</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Median Target Price</p></td> <td><p>$3.82</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NAV Per Share</p></td> <td><p>$5.44</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Current Price</p></td> <td><p>$7.90</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NTM Total EV/Revenues</p></td> <td><p>4.33x</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total EV</p></td> <td><p>424.27</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Market Cap</p></td> <td><p>323.64</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr><td colspan=\"6\"><p>*Data from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXTI/income-statement\">Seeking Alpha</a> and www.tikr.com</p></td></tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT reported strong financial performance for Q3<span></span> 2025. Revenue increased, and net loss has greatly improved. Operating expenses have decreased. Revenue has reached a historical high over the last eight quarters. The company expects demand to increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because the company supplies raw materials and substrates for data centers, its stock price has rallied over the last twelve months.

Each company provides hardware and software support for data centers. The sector has undergone a constant rally over AI computing and an increase in data centers globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT and Applied Optoelectronics are unique compared to their peers because they provide raw materials and substrates for optical networks, like data centers. AAOI also makes optical switches. Both companies provide materials for other products besides data centers. CommScope Holdings, Cisco Systems, and NETGEAR provide hardware and software for data centers and other network solutions, like home and business. AXT has its largest footprint in China and Asia, while the other companies supply North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT is underperforming compared to its peers. CommScope Holdings and Applied Optoelectronics are outperforming their peers. The stock prices are overvalued across the board, and some analysts worry about an AI and data center bubble. The stock prices have been increasing, and caution is advised.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Strategy and Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT is at low risk of poor financial performance. The only exception concerns the situation around export permits for its backlog. The company has made progress on the issue. Otherwise, the company sees widespread adoption of its substrate and raw materials into the supply chain for data centers. The company has firm plans to capture this growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Hold rating for AXT comes at a moderate risk. The stock price has rallied and could sink again. The long-term outlook remains good for the company. Their products are in demand, and the sector is experiencing positive sentiment. Compared to its peers, the company trades at a discount.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT reported strong financial results for Q3<span></span> 2025 and expects in-line results for Q4. The company is in the process of processing its backlog as it gains export permits for its substrate and raw materials. AXT foresees high demand for its products to continue to increase. The stock price has rallied over the last twelve months and seems a bit overvalued. I continue my rating of a Hold for the company.</p>",

My conviction lies in TZOO's good fundamentals and market mispricing on its poor margins. The company is fundamentally stronger as it has improved in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> quality from its ability to increase operating margin from 2022 till 2024 and is working to monetize its free membership base. Moreover, TZOO has negative net debt and has high insider ownership with the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10294912\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bartel family's stake (36.7%) </a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">in page 10 of the Q2 quarterly report, aligning with minority shareholders. I set a 3-year target price of $24, with ~15x as my exit multiple for 2027E earnings at $1.60 EPS. I believe this to be conservative and would also imply IRR &gt; 60%, which more than compensates for the micro-cap risk.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q2-Q3 2025 Earnings Commentary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TZOO's Q2 and Q3 2025 results together reflect a consistent pattern of solid top-line growth paired with intentional, margin-compressing investments in its paid membership transition. In Q2, revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $23.9mil which was led by strong growth in both North American and European segments and a 33% revenue increase from Jack's Flight Club. Membership fee income also surged to $3.0mil, up from $1.2mil last year. However, operating income has dropped to $2.1mil from $4.0mil due to higher market and acquisition costs as the company aggressively acquired new paying customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By Q3 2025, the reinvestment trend continued: revenue rose 10% to $22.2mil while operating profit dipped to $0.5mil as TZOO accelerated its club member acquisition strategy. Management disclosed payback per member remains positive within a quarter. The higher membership fees (<a href=\"https://ir.travelzoo.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Presentation-FINAL-v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">$3.6mil</a> in Q3 report, page 9) confirm that the reinvestment is working and driving future revenue visibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Jack's Flight Club remained profitable and delivered 12% revenue growth. Cash flow from operations was -$0.4mil due to reducing merchant payables and the company did buybacks of 148k shares. I think this quarter continues to be transitional and constructive rather than structurally bad.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TZOO is transitioning from an advertising business model to a subscription travel club, which would unlock recurring revenue and deepen membership loyalty. I believe the market has not yet appreciated this transition and is mispricing TZOO due to short-term earnings compression and its micro-cap profile. The market has overlooked a combination of positive factors: an inflecting membership base, significant operating leverage, and aggressive share buybacks.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What the market has missed?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Membership Inflection: </strong>TZOO's shift to a paid membership since 2024 was transformational, but the market doesn't give full credit. In fact, TZOO has gained ~225,000 paying members in Sep-2025 based on $9.0mil deferred revenue (based on an annual membership fee of $40). This gain would provide recurring revenue, which would be recognized in subsequent quarters. Moreover, the unit economics are also very attractive. In Q3 2025, TZOO spent ~$40 to acquire a new member (page 5 of Q3 Investor Presentation), but they would earn ~$55 within the same quarter. This means that there is already a positive LTV/CAC in the first quarter. Subsequent cost would be minimal as the member is already inside the ecosystem while contributing to its revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales and Marketing\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"569\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sales and Marketing <span>(Q3 Report</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where the market got it wrong. They see the big marketing expense as a negative, causing EPS to decline. But they did not recognize the future incremental benefits. This means that TZOO is building a subscription annuity, which should warrant a higher multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Earnings Masked:</strong> The market considers TZOO as a no-earnings-growth company, as diluted EPS has dropped from $1.06 to $0.66 from 2024 to TTM Q3 2025. However, I see it as a trough earnings situation, as its true earnings potential is hidden. TZOO is essentially reinvesting into the business by increasing marketing expenses, and that increases paying membership count. Moreover, the business is also structurally higher margin, as in 2024, its operating margin is ~22% compared to 2022 at ~11%. Once the company has amassed a substantial number of paying customers, it would be difficult for the market to ignore it anymore, leading to a positive re-rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Buybacks and Insider Alignment: </strong>The market also has not fully accounted for the buybacks the company has done, as the total shares outstanding is ~8% less than last year. Moreover, the company has such a small float, and any institutional accumulation would move the stock significantly upwards.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I value TZOO at different angles. On a forward P/E basis, the company is trading around 10.5x, where its sector median is 14.3x and its five-year average is at 18.2x, which is a 42% discount. Moreover, on a forward EV/EBITDA basis, the company is trading around 6.9x, where its sector median is 8.3x. Thus, we can clearly say that the company is traded at a discount compared to its peer group and on a historical basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Comparing the forward EV/EBITDA of specific names like Booking Holdings (16.8x), Expedia (8.7x), TZOO's forward EV/EBITDA looks dirt cheap. On a price/FCF basis, using TZOO's TTM FCF at $10.8mil and having ~90mil market cap, this expresses a P/FCF of 8.3x, implying a 12% FCF yield. I would consider this an opportunity to accumulate at this level. Moreover, TZOO is still growing, but the stock is trading at distressed levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, by traditional metrics, TZOO appears undervalued. The likely reason it is trading at severe discounts to peers is because of its small-size and the short-term EPS decline. However, once the company is able to demonstrate earnings power, its multiple should expand rapidly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bull &amp; Bear Cases:</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bull case:</strong> By 2027, assuming TZOO accumulated 700k paying members (~2.3% of its free base) with $50 ARPU, which would lead to $35mil subscription revenue ($50*700k). An ARPU of $50 is a conservative estimate, as a paying customer would already have an estimated $55 by the first quarter. Moreover, every quarter would have an estimated $15 ARPU, leading to an annualized ARPU of $60 per year. Thus, I used $50 as ARPU in my revenue calculation for conservative purposes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, advertising revenue could also expand to $85mil as more members are added, increasing its negotiation power for higher ad revenue. Thus, by 2027, this would add up to $120mil annual revenue ($85mil + $35mil) and with 20% operating margin due to scale and lower marketing costs, EBIT would be around $24mil. Net margins may expand to 15%, implying $1.6 EPS with 11 million shares outstanding after shares buyback. At a 15x multiple, the company would have a target price of $24, which is ~3x of the current price. Moreover, as the company is small, there is also the catalyst of a private takeover or acquisition by a larger travel company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bear case:</strong> In a bearish scenario, its plan to monetize and convert its free customer base may not be as successful, and as macro conditions worsen, its revenue would falter. With only the ability to accumulate up to 500k paying customers, this would only lead to $25mil revenue (500k*$50) with $50 as ARPU, and a decline in ad revenue to 50mil from poorer macro conditions. By 2027, this would only add up to just $75mil of total revenue ($50mil + $20mil). Net margins could also slip to just 10%, and EPS fall to just $0.68, accounting for 11mil shares outstanding after buybacks. Giving it an 8x multiple, would lead to ~$5.4 in target price. This means there would be a ~33% downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, this is an asymmetrical setup where the upside (3x) vastly outweighs the downside (~33%). The bull case hinges on the company proving to retain and grow its customer base. Moreover, even if it fails, the company has a good balance sheet with its negative net debt.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of the key risks to our thesis are that the paid membership strategy may not yield the conversion expected. For instance, TZOO fails to demonstrate enough exclusive value to its paying customers, the members would leave the platform altogether, and ad revenue would also be impacted. There is also competition risk from Expedia or Google, which may have better deal offerings or targeted marketing to reduce TZOO's appeal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, changes in data privacy laws (like stricter e-privacy and cookie restrictions) could also make it harder for TZOO to acquire new members through digital marketing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe TZOO offers a very compelling asymmetric setup where the company has good fundamentals, but the market is overly focused on short-term margin pressure. The Q2 and Q3 2025 results confirmed that earning softness was due to reinvestment into paid membership growth and not structural weakness. I see a 3-year target price of $24, implying an IRR of &gt;60%. TZOO is a BUY at these levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

The company's guidance above indicates upstream earnings alone growing from just under $19 billion to more than $25 billion by 2030. At the same time, we expect the company's remaining earnings to continue their growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That combination will enable <span></span>Exxon Mobil to ramp up shareholder returns at a time when energy is in higher demand than ever and the company has an irreplaceable portfolio of assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The largest risk to our thesis is crude oil prices. WTI prices are just a hair over $60/barrel, and Brent is in the mid-$60s<span></span>/barrel. While Exxon Mobil is profitable at these levels, at a more than 5% free cash flow yield, the company still needs future growth to justify its valuation. That's a risk in an economy struggling with tariffs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exxon Mobil's earnings show that the company remains a profitable giant at a time of high-energy demand. The company has an almost $490 billion market capitalization with an almost 3.5% dividend yield and share buybacks that are even larger than its dividend. Despite that, the company maintains a manageable net-debt portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exxon Mobil is continuing to aggressively grow. The company has seen surprisingly good results from Guyana and the Permian Basin, pushing production to almost 4.8 million barrels<span></span>/day. The company expects production to ramp up further from that time, crossing 5 million barrels<span></span>/day shortly.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes Exxon Mobil a valuable investment.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GILD\" title=\"Gilead Sciences, Inc.\">GILD</a>) Tecartus was <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/u-s-fda-approves-kite-s-tecartus-first-only-car-t-adults-relapsed-refractory-b-cell-acute-5678.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">approved</a> to treat B-ALL in 2021, earning revenues of &gt;$400m last year, based on a 65% complete remission and 13.6 months DoR. AUCATZYL's two data sets average out at a slightly superior CR rate and superior median DoR.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus notes in its 2024 annual report/<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9703540\">10-K filing</a> that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>There are two direct in class competitors to AUCATZYL approved for the treatment of adult patients with r/r B-ALL: the autologous CAR therapies Tecartus and Kymriah. Tecartus is approved for use in adult B-ALL and Kymriah is approved for use in adolescents and young adults, (i.e., patients up to the age of 25). We believe obe-cel has a differentiated safety profile and shows potential for longer term outcomes when compared to these current approved therapies.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, then, my point is that despite delivering on the promises made back in 2021 to secure approval for a cell therapy - besides the US, Aucatzyl has subsequently won approvals in the UK and EU - and designing and building a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in the UK - the market has remained nonplussed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A few days ago, another UK based biotech company, Adaptimmune, which had secured FDA approval for an engineered T-cell therapy, Teclera, to treat synovial sarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma, <a href=\"https://www.adaptimmune.com/investors-and-media/news-center/press-releases/detail/289/adaptimmune-announces-delisting-from-nasdaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> its delisting from the Nasdaq. The company previously sold Teclera to US WorldMeds, having exhausted its own funding, being unable to make its drug commercially successful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is there a danger something similar could happen to Autolus? In this note I'll cover some recent developments at the company, and explain why, although Autolus stock may not be emitting \"screaming buy\" signals at present, I believe the company can survive, and potentially even thrive long-term - but not so much in the near-term, given some difficult headwinds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus, Recent Updates - Q2 Earnings: Sales Impress, But Regulatory Issues Undermine Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last note I covered Autolus' Q1 earnings, which saw Aucatzyl earn $9m of revenues, and the company report a net loss of $(70.2m), or $(0.26) per share, and a cash position of ~$500m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus reported <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20197223-autolus-therapeutics-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-business-updates#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q2 earnings</a> on August 12th (Q3 results are due <a href=\"https://autolus.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/autolus-therapeutics-report-third-quarter-2025-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">12th November</a>). Aucatzyl product revenue came to $20.9m. Management noted that 46 authorised treatment centres in the US are now online (the process of being treated with Aucatzyl involves T-cell collection via leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, two infusions ten days apart, followed by monitoring for at least 14 days at the healthcare facility), and that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Patient access to AUCATZYL continues to increase, with coverage secured for greater than 90% of total U.S. medical lives.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus reported a cost of sales figure of $24.4m, R&amp;D expenses of $27.4m, and SG&amp;A expenses of $30.3m. Loss from operations came to $(61.2m), while net loss came to $(47.9m). Cash and equivalents came to $454.3m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As things stand, then, the market values Autolus' business at less that its available cash, which is fairly damning in terms of its belief that Autolus can turn Aucatzyl into a successful commercial product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's understandable in many ways - besides Adaptimmune, Bluebird Bio is another company that developed multiple approved cell therapies, including Lyfgenia, to treat sickle cell disease, but could not make them work financially - Bluebird was<a href=\"https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-announces-completion-acquisition-carlyle-and-sk\" rel=\"nofollow\"> taken private</a> earlier this year for a fraction of what it was once worth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the Q2 earnings call, Autolus was unable to provide a timeline for when the business may become gross profitable. Aucatzyl is an expensive therapy, costing ~$525k, which is substantially more than Gilead Sciences (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GILD\" title=\"Gilead Sciences, Inc.\">GILD</a>) Tecartus, which costs ~$425k, but less than Novartis (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>) Kymriah, which costs $580k.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Pharma giants like Gilead and Novartis can absorb the losses associated with the early commercial launch of a product, thanks to the tens of billions of dollars they earn from other products, Autolus must operate under much more restrictive financial conditions, and this is a problem most keenly felt in Europe - the likes of Bluebird have formerly pulled their cell therapies from Europe after being unable to agree on pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, with the Trump administration now attempting to implement a most favoured nation (\"MFN\") approach to drug pricing in the US, i.e., Americans pay no more for their prescription drugs than whichever nation charges the least, matters become yet more complicated for Autolus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Formerly, the company may have seen the US as its most lucrative market, but MFN, and the Trump administration's threat to introduce tariffs on pharma imports from overseas, adds a further layer of uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the Q2 earnings call, Autolus' CEO Dr. Christian Itin, spoke at length about the problems Europe has valuing drugs and their benefit, noting that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>as a consequence, we've seen a substantial proportion of cell and gene therapy products actually not being launched in Europe. There's something like 8 out of 18 that were not launched. So that's the backdrop. So we're going to do this very methodically, going to go through country by country and are navigating that.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, then, it's hard to state with confidence that Autolus can make a profit selling Aucatzyl in the ALL setting in the US, or Europe. On the earnings call, the idea of patients traveling to the UK for treatment was discussed, although for a company attempting to make its drug available in as many localities as possible to attract patients, this may not be a viable long-term solution.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding The Indications for Aucatzyl</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One solution that Autolus is working on is turning Aucatzyl, or obe-cel, into a \"pipeline in a product\" i.e. secure approval for the therapy in other indications besides the narrow indication of ALL, where analysts have <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/autolus-fda-approval-aucatzyl-obe-cel-car-t/732543/\" rel=\"nofollow\">speculated</a> the drug could earn peak revenues of ~$300m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1193\" data-height=\"645\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49171940-17619162709144561_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Autolus pipeline <span>(presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see above, Autolus does have multiple studies ongoing. A pediatric ALL approval would increase the addressable market, and as we can see above, pediatric data is expected before the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are multiple early stage programs ongoing too, it seems; however, the company's main goal appears to be establishing obe-cel as an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see, studies in lupus and progressive multiple sclerosis (\"MS\") are ongoing, and there is evidence - from <a href=\"https://www.the-rheumatologist.org/article/car-t-cell-therapy-in-autoimmune-disease-the-next-frontier/\" rel=\"nofollow\">landmark studies</a> conducted by Dr. Georg Schett - that cell therapies can be adapted to treat autoimmune diseases. With that said, despite several companies - Cabaletta Bio (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CABA\" title=\"Cabaletta Bio, Inc.\">CABA</a>), Kyverna Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KYTX\" title=\"Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc.\">KYTX</a>), Bristol Myers Squibb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMY\" title=\"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\">BMY</a>) attempting to develop such therapies, no one has yet been able to replicate the success of Dr. Schett.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus will dose first patients in studies in lupus and MS and present a Phase 1 study design in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (\"SLE\") before the end of this year, management has promised, and signs of early success could prove a major upside catalyst for the company, but we must acknowledge that these programs are speculative and may be as likely to fail as they are to succeed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead - Am I Upholding My Buy Rating On Autolus Stock Given Recent Developments?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed, the quality of Autolus' therapy has been proven in clinical studies, and established Aucatzyl as arguably the best treatment for relapsed or refractory patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Unlike Tecartus or Kymriah, the FDA has not required a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (\"REMS\") program for the therapy, although it does come with a black box warning for the excessive immune response called cytokine release syndrome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I noted in my last post that longer-term data from the FELIX study was due imminently, and could open the door for further approvals, and that data was summarised in the Q2 earnings release as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Autolus <a href=\"https://autolus.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/autolus-therapeutics-presents-long-term-follow-felix-study\" rel=\"nofollow\">presented updated long-term data</a> from the FELIX study in adult patients with r/r B-ALL in an oral presentation at the 2025 European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress in June. For patients with a response, the updated median duration of response (mDOR) is now 42.5 months.</p> <p>At the updated median follow up of 32.8 months, 38.4% of responders were in ongoing remission without consolidative stem cell therapy or other therapies (versus the previously reported 40% at a median follow-up of 21.5 months).</p> <p>The 24-month probability of Event Free Survival was 43%, and the Overall Survival was 46%, with a further consolidating long-term plateau observed. No new safety signals or Grade ≥3 secondary malignancies were observed at the extended follow-up. These results suggest that obe-cel may be a durable treatment option for some patients with r/r B-ALL.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Five year Tecartus data showed an OS rate of 40% at four years, so there is arguably not much to choose between the two therapies, but Tecartus is also approved for Mantle Cell Lymphoma - frankly, I wonder if Autolus would be better off attempting to secure a similar label expansion as opposed to conducting its \"moonshot\" autoimmune studies. We may also note that Kymriah - $200m of revenues in 1H25 - is approved to treat B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, besides ALL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since Autolus <a href=\"https://autolus.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/autolus-announces-closing-initial-public-offering-and-full\" rel=\"nofollow\">joined the Nasdaq</a> in 2018, raising ~$150m at $17 per share, the company has done many things right, in my view, but aside from a brief period in early 2024 when its biologics license application requesting approval for obe-cel was accepted by the FDA, and the company announced a $200m investment from BioNTech (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNTX\" title=\"BioNTech SE\">BNTX</a>), to co-develop and commercialize CAR-T cell therapies, when shares spiked &gt;$7, it has been pretty much all downhill for the share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It may not be fair, but it is the reality, and I am not sure I see this changing in the near-to-medium term, due to the current uncertainty around drug pricing both in Europe and the US. For a company selling an expensive therapy in a relatively niche indication, competing against two incumbents with a similar safety and efficacy profile, this is a tricky scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus reported cash and equivalents of $123.8m as of the end of Q2, and marketable securities of $330m, therefore, given its net loss in 1H25 was $115m, its funding runway could be exhausted by early 2027. Autolus therefore finds itself under pressure to raise more funding, which could be difficult with its shares trading at such a low value. In its Q2 earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20197223-autolus-therapeutics-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-business-updates#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">press release,</a> management states that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Autolus estimates that, with its current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the Company is well capitalized to drive the launch and commercialization of obe-cel in r/r B-ALL and to obtain data in the LN pivotal trial and MS Phase 1 trial.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Autolus' accumulated deficit now stands at $1.2bn, which is an eye-watering sum, but one that has produced a strong product in Aucatzyl. I am quite impressed by the Q2 revenue figure and hopeful we will see it climb higher in Q3, but in other areas - cash consumption, speculative autoimmune studies, and early-stage research programs—I am less convinced. For example, based on a nine-month net loss, I have no choice but to downgrade my Buy rating to a Hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problems Autolus faces today, which I have tried to outline in this post, are hopefully not terminal, but the headwinds are fairly strong at this time, and that makes me think Autolus can survive, but not thrive, in the near-to-medium term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I were management, I'd be looking to focus primarily on taking market share from Tecartus/Kymriah, and securing similar label expansions, whilst trying to engage in some cost-cutting, but hopefully, a momentous readout for the autoimmune program next year will allow the company to raise funds, and justify the additional R&amp;D spend.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of its upcoming Q3 earnings, the most important number will be the Aucatzyl revenue figure - management has not provided any specific guidance, but a beat on analysts' expectations would give it some breathing space. It's possible the company may tease some pediatric ALL data too - initial data has been promised in 2H25 - which could be another share price needle moving update.</p>",

In fact, the S&amp;P500 has already crossed 6875 on Monday (10/27/2025) and is close to 6900 as we write this. It is only about 100 points short of the SPX7000 level that is psychologically important. The most recent rally has been powered by the hopes of further interest rate cuts by the Fed before the year's end (with one 25-basis-point cut already announced today) and the strong start of the earnings season. We did expect the market to cross the SPX7000 level by the year-end, but it appears we might get that much sooner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You can see the current odds of the Fed's next rate cut here on the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CME FedWatchTool</a> website.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Also, this week, President Trump is meeting with the Chinese President to resolve the trade frictions between the two largest economies. The meeting is scheduled for Thursday. </span>Even though the outcomes are not yet known (at the time of writing), the market does not seem to be overly concerned. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, five of the Magnificent Seven companies are due to release their earnings this week. This may be the make-or-break moment for the market for the rest of the year. If there is any disappointment of any sort from these tech giants, we might see a quick retrenchment. The big question now is what happens after SPX7000. Will the rally continue, or are we already at the peak?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_09b869f0cd0764b80f8e9700f3c99416.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is always good to have some idea of where the markets and the broader economy may be headed. Even so, we believe markets are always unpredictable, and it is not possible to catch the exact bottom (or the peak). So, it is best to invest regularly and consistently in good, solid dividend-paying stocks when their valuations are reasonable or attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month, we highlight three groups with five stocks each that have an average dividend yield (as a group) of 4.1%, 5.3%, and 7.9%, respectively. The first list is for conservative and risk-averse investors, while the second is for investors seeking higher yields but still wanting relatively safe dividends. The third group is for yield-hungry investors but comes with an elevated risk, and we urge investors to exercise caution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>The Selection Process:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Goals and Objectives:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The main goal of this series of articles is to shortlist and highlight companies that have a solid history of paying and raising dividends. In addition, we demand that these companies support strong fundamentals, carry low debt, and are offered at a relatively cheaper valuation. These DGI stocks are not going to make anyone rich overnight, but if your goal is to attain financial freedom by owning stocks that would grow dividends over time, meaningfully and sustainably, then you are at the right place. These lists are not necessarily recommendations to buy, but a shortlist of probable candidates for further research. Besides, we think each month, if nothing else, this analysis is able to highlight some nuggets that would have otherwise skipped our attention.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Every month, we start with roughly 7,500 stocks that are listed and traded on U.S. exchanges, including over-the-counter (OTC) networks. Using our filtering criteria, the initial list is quickly narrowed to roughly 700 stocks, mostly dividend-paying and dividend-growing. From thereon, by using various data elements, including dividend history, payout ratios, revenue growth, debt ratios, EPS growth, etc., we calculate a \"Dividend Quality Score\" for each stock that measures the relative safety and sustainability of the dividend. In addition to dividend safety, we also seek cheaper valuations. We also demand that the selected companies have an established business model, solid dividend history, manageable debt, and investment-grade credit rating.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Notes: 1) Please note that when we use the term \"safe\" in relation to stocks and investments, it should be interpreted as</em> <em>\"relatively safe\" because nothing is absolutely safe in investing. Even though we present only 5 to 10 stocks in our final list, one should have 15-20 stocks at a minimum in a well-diversified portfolio.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>2) All tables in this article are created by the author unless explicitly specified. The stock data have been sourced from various sources such as Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, GuruFocus, Morningstar, and CCC-List (Dividend Radar).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Criteria to Shortlist:</em></strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>Market cap &gt; $7 billion (some exceptions can be made)</em></li> <li><em>Dividend yield &gt; 1.0% (some exceptions are made to include high-quality but lower-yielding companies)</em></li> <li><em>Daily average volume &gt; 100,000</em></li> <li><em>Dividend growth past five years &gt;= 0.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>By applying the above criteria, we got around 600 companies.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Narrowing Down the List</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>As a first step, we would like to eliminate stocks that have less than five years of dividend history. Also, since we want a lot of flexibility and wider choice at this initial stage, we include some companies that pay dividends lower than the S&amp;P500 but otherwise have a stellar dividend record and growing dividends at a fast pace.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>However, so far in this list, we have demanded five or more years of consistent dividend growth. But what if a company had a very stable record of dividend payments but did not increase the dividends from one year to another? At times, some of these companies are foreign-based companies, and due to currency fluctuations, their dividends may appear to have been cut in U.S. dollars, but in reality, that may not be true at all when looked at in the actual currency of reporting. At times, we may provide some exceptions when a company may have cut the dividend in the past, but otherwise, it looks compelling. </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>We now import the various data elements from many sources and assign weights based on different criteria as listed below:</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>Current yield: Indicates the yield based on the current price.</em></li> <li><em>Dividend growth history (number of years of dividend growth): This provides information on how many years a company has paid and increased dividends on a consistent basis. For stocks under the category 'B' (defined above), we consider the total number of consecutive years of dividends paid rather than the number of years of dividend growth.</em></li> <li><em>Payout ratio: This indicates how comfortably the company can pay the dividend from its earnings. We prefer this ratio to be as low as possible, which would indicate the company's ability to grow the dividend in the future. This ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount per share by the EPS (earnings per share). The cash-flow payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount paid per share by the cash flow generated per share.</em></li> <li><em>Past three-year and 5-year dividend growth: Even though it's the dividend growth rate from the past, this does indicate how fast the company has been able to grow its earnings and dividends in the recent past. The recent past is the best indicator that we have to know what to expect in the next few years.</em></li> <li><em>EPS growth (average of previous five years of growth and expected next five years' growth): As the earnings of a company grow, more than likely, dividends will grow accordingly. We will take into account the actual EPS growth of the previous five years and the estimated EPS growth for the next five years. We will add the two numbers and assign weights.</em></li> <li><em>Chowder number: So, what's the Chowder number? This number has been named after the well-known SA author Chowder, who first coined and popularized this factor. This number is derived by adding the current yield and the past five years' dividend growth rate. A Chowder number of \"12\" or more (\"8\" for utilities) is considered good.</em></li> <li><em>Debt/equity ratio: This ratio will tell us about the company's debt load in relation to its equity. We all know that too much debt can lead to major problems, even for well-known companies. The lower this ratio, the better it is. Sometimes, we find this ratio to be negative or unavailable, even for well-known companies. This can happen for a myriad of reasons and is not always a reason for concern. This is why we use this ratio in combination with the debt/asset ratio (covered next).</em></li> <li><em>Debt/asset ratio: This ratio will tell us about the debt load in relation to the company's total assets. In almost all cases, this ratio would be lower than the debt/equity ratio. Also, this ratio is important because, for some companies, the debt/equity ratio is not a reliable indicator.</em></li> <li><em>S&amp;P's credit rating: This is the credit rating assigned by the rating agency S&amp;P Global and is indicative of the company's ability to service its debt. This rating can be obtained from the S&amp;P website.</em></li> <li><em>PEG ratio: This is also called the price/earnings-to-growth ratio. The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator if the stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced. A lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. However, PEG for a company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation. Some use past growth, while others may use future expected growth.</em></li> <li><em>Distance from 52-week high: We want to select companies that are good, solid companies, but also are trading at cheaper valuations currently. They may be cheaper due to some temporary down cycle, or some combination of bad news, or simply having a bad quarter. This criterion will help bring such companies (with a cheaper valuation) near the top as long as they excel in other criteria as well. This factor is calculated as (current price - 52-week high) / 52-week high.</em></li> <li><em>Sales or Revenue growth: This is the average growth rate in annual sales or revenue of the company over the last five years. A company can only grow its earnings power as long as it can grow its revenue. Sure, it can grow the earnings by cutting costs, but that can't go on forever.</em></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Selection Of The Top 50</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Downloadable Dataset:</strong> Below, we provide a link to the table with relevant data on nearly 500 stocks. Readers can download this table for further analysis. Please note that the table is sorted by \"Total Weight\" or \"Quality Score.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/attachments/download/40543\" class=\"sa-attachment\" data-id=\"40543\">File-for-export_-_5_Secure_DGI_-_NOV_2025.xlsx</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will first bring down the list (of 400-plus names) to roughly 50 names by automated criteria, as listed below. In the second step, which is mostly manual and subjective, we will bring the list down to about 15.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Step 1: First, take the top 20 names from the above table (based on total weight or quality score). At times, some industry segments tend to get overcrowded at the top, so we take the top two (or three) and ignore the rest.</li> <li>Step 2: As a second step, we will take the top 10 names based on the highest dividend yield. When it comes to dividend yield, some of the industry segments tend to be overcrowded. So, we will take the top two (or a maximum of three) names from any single industry segment.</li> <li>Step 3: Now, we will sort our list based on five-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names.</li> <li>Step 4: We will now consider more recent dividend growth, as that is more indicative of the company's future growth. We will sort our list based on 3-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names.</li> <li>Step 5: We also want to give priority to stocks that are rated highest in terms of credit rating. So, we will sort the list based on the numerical weight of the credit rating and select the top 10 stocks with the best credit rating. Again, we are careful not to have too many names from the same sector.</li> <li>Step 6: Lastly, as the name of the series suggests, we want to have some names that may be trading cheaper in comparison to their historical valuation. So, we select the top ten names with the highest discount. However, they could be trading cheap for just the wrong reasons, so we need to be careful that they meet our other quality criteria.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the above steps, we now have a total of 70 names in our final consideration. However, the following stocks appeared more than once:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks that appeared two times: ACN, ADP, AU, CAG, CI, CVE, GE, HWM, LYB, MSFT, OC, and WIT (12 duplicates).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks that appeared three times: CIB (2 duplicates).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After removing eight duplicates, we are left with 56 (70-14) names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since we still have a very large list, we will remove names that have a low yield and not very great dividend growth. So, if the dividend yield was less than &lt; 2.5% and the dividend growth (average of 5-year and 10-year) was less than 8%-10%, we would rather remove them at this stage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we remove AMP and NFG. After removing them, we are left with 54 names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since there are still multiple names in each industry segment, we will keep a maximum of two or three names (from the top) from any one segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On this basis, we remove a total of 14 names: EMN, ACN, FMX, ACI, BBVA, TD, IBKR, MMC, NVO, UNH, CTRA, IMO, OKE, and PAG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After we remove these 16 names, we are left with 40 (54-14) names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top names from each sector/industry segment are presented:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial Services, Banking, and Insurance:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Banks- Regional:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Banks- Major: (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp;

So, while most of the filtering until now was based on automated criteria, the last step is pretty much subjective. We try to make each of the three lists highly diversified among various sectors and industry segments, and try to ensure that the safety of dividends matches the overall risk profile of the group. We certainly encourage readers to do further research on the highlighted names.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, here are our three final lists for this month:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final A-List (Relatively Safe Income):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Criteria for this group:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The average yield for the group is between 2.75% and 4.25%.</li> <li>At least three or four names with an 'A' rating (from S&amp;P)</li> <li>Solid track record of dividends and growth.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Average yield: 4.1%</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTU\" title=\"Intuit Inc.\">INTU</a>)</strong></li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADP\" class=\"ticker-link\">ADP)</a></strong></li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TS\" class=\"ticker-link\">TS)</a></strong></li> <li> <strong>(C</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V\"><strong>V</strong></a><strong>X)</strong> </li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V\" title=\"Visa Inc.\">V</a><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Z\" title=\"Zillow Group, Inc.\">Z</a>)</strong></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Table-1A: A-LIST (Conservative Income)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1429\" data-height=\"177\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T1A\" width=\"640\" height=\"79\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055043237_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We think this set of five companies (in the A-List) would form a solid diversified group of dividend companies that would be appealing to income-seeking and conservative investors, including retirees and near-retirees. The average yield is 3.56%, which is more than 3x of what the S&amp;P 500 pays. The average dividend history is 20 years. Also, all five companies have an excellent rating of 'A-' or higher. If you must need higher dividends, consider the B-List or the C-List, presented later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As usual, we will provide a brief synopsis of each of the companies selected here; however, we will not go into too many details, as that will make the article unduly long.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>INTU (Intuit Inc):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current dividend yield of Intuit is very low at 0.70%, so it does not serve the purpose of retirees who may depend on dividends for their income. But the reason we include it in the A-list is due to its potential for dividend growth. The dividend growth has been 15% (or plus) for 3, 5, and 10-year periods. Its major premium products include TurboTax and QuickBooks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Intuit appears to be firing on all cylinders and has achieved 20% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 16% growth on a full-year basis, both beating management's own guidance. The operating margins have also been expanding nicely. There are some risks and competitive threats from free programs, such as the IRS's \"Direct File\" program. However, it poses only minimal risk to Intuit's business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>ADP (Automatic Data Processing):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ADP's yield is relatively low at 2.2%, but it is often considered a favorite of dividend investors, given the company's stability and reliability of the dividend and above-average dividend growth. It is relatively rare to find this company trading at cheaper valuations, except during deep market corrections. Morningstar rates the stock price just about 'fairly valued'. So, the shares are not cheap either, but still 10-15% below the 52-week high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For dividend investors, the company offers a 50-year record of consistently growing dividends. The last increase was a 10% increase. The past 3-year and 5-year dividend growth has been impressive at roughly 14% and 11%, respectively. Even though the yield is low, we think relatively high growth should compensate for the low yield in the long run. It is being included in the A-list for its exceptional record of growing dividends and excellent credit rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>TS (Tenaris S.A.):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tenaris is headquartered in Luxembourg but has a lot of presence and manufacturing facilities in the U.S. The company manufactures and supplies steel pipes and related products &amp; services for the energy sector, specifically in the drilling industry. Nearly 50% of the company's revenues come from North America, while 20% from South America. In fact, Europe contributes less than 10% of the company's revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is currently facing a number of industry-specific headwinds due to the slowdown in the Oil industry, but it supports a very solid financial base with <strong>almost zero debt.</strong> Besides, it has a strong cash reserve of nearly $4 billion. It is a very shareholder-friendly company, and in the last year, it returned almost a billion dollars in the form of dividends and share buy-backs. Currently, the yield is very attractive at 6.25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CVX (CHEVRON):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CVX needs no introduction as an oil major and is probably one of the best investments in its sector for stable income. However, earnings and the share price of the company are obviously tied to the movement of the oil prices, which can fluctuate widely based on geopolitical situations of the day. That being said, the company provides relative safety, an excellent credit rating, stable business, and a reasonably high dividend yield for a large company. Chevron is known to be a low-cost producer with its breakeven price in the low to mid-40s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similar to previous months, we are including CVX in the A-list for reasons stated above. CVX currently offers a highly attractive dividend yield of close to 4.4%. The payout ratio is currently a bit high on an EPS basis and relatively low on a cash flow basis. The dividend growth has been a bit tepid over the years, but reasonable at 6% plus, considering the starting yield. The company maintains an excellent credit rating of 'AA' from S&amp;P, which shows its financial strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>VZ (Verizon):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verizon has had a few tough years, at least since 2022. There was some respite in 2024, but the stock price has been pulled down once again to below $40. With the stock price once again under $40 a share, it should be treated as in buying territory. With the current prices, it is fairly undervalued, and it is nearly 25% below the fair value assigned by Morningstar. It supports a reasonably high dividend yield of close to 7.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, the big negative with the company is its continued high debt burden. Even then, Verizon still remains a strong player among the three large telecom companies in the U.S., and it offers an attractive reward-to-risk ratio. With interest rates coming down, income-oriented stocks like VZ are likely to benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final B-List (High Yield, Moderately Safe):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Criteria for this group:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Yield for the group between 4.75% to 6.50%</li> <li>At least two names with 'A-' (or above) rated.</li> <li>Above-average track record of dividends and growth</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Average yield: 5.3%</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><strong>(IN<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TU\" class=\"ticker-link\">TU)</a></strong></li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADP\" title=\"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.\">ADP</a>)</strong></li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TS\" title=\"Tenaris S.A.\">TS</a>)</strong></li> <li> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX\"><strong>MPLX</strong></a><strong>)</strong> </li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>)</strong></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note 1: Very often, we include a few low-risk stocks in the B-list and C-list. Also, oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists. This is done on purpose. We try to make each of our lists fairly diversified among different sectors/industry segments of the economy.

Please use due diligence.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the B-List, the overall risk profile of the group becomes slightly elevated compared to the A-List. That said, the group (as a whole) will likely provide safe dividends for many years. This list offers an average yield of 5.25% and an average of 23 years of dividend history and 11 years (average) of consecutive growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of our high-yield selections often repeat in the B-list and C-list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>MPLX (MPLX LP):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the B-List and C-List, the dividend yield of Chevron is somewhat low. So, we replace it with MPLX LP, a highly attractive name from the midstream energy industry, mainly to elevate the yield. Please note that the company has a Partnership structure and issues a K-1 tax form (partnership income) instead of the usual 1099 in case of regular dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have covered MPLX multiple times in our previous articles in this monthly series. Hence, we will skip the details here. MPLX regularly features on our B-list and C-list due to its stable dividend growth and high yield. There are other good alternatives, such as Enterprise Products Partners (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD\" title=\"Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units\">EPD</a>) or Energy Transfer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET\" title=\"Energy Transfer LP Common Units\">ET</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>ARCC (Ares Capital):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are including Ares Capital in the B-list and the C-list. ARCC is one of the largest BDCs (Business Development Companies) in terms of market capitalization and net asset value. The company invests in small and medium-sized companies and has a diversified portfolio of investments in over 500 companies. Besides, ARCC has a proven record of performing reasonably well both in high and low-interest rate environments. Pricing and valuation-wise, it trades at a slight premium for being one of the largest in the BDC arena, and its stable dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It generates a solid amount of NII (net Investment income), which currently exceeds well above the $1.2 billion mark on an annual basis. ARCC currently offers a highly attractive yield of roughly 9.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final C-LIST (Yield-Hungry, Less Safe):</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Criteria for this group:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The average yield for the group is between 7.0% to 8.0%</li> <li>All names with investment-grade ratings.</li> <li>Some potential for growth.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Average yield: 7.9%</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX\"><strong>MPLX</strong></a><strong>)</strong> </li> <li> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPS\"><strong>UPS</strong></a><strong>)</strong> </li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAG\" class=\"ticker-link\">CAG)</a></strong></li> <li> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\"><strong>ARCC</strong></a><strong>)</strong> </li> <li><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V\" title=\"Visa Inc.\">V</a>Z)</strong></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Notes:</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note 1: Oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists.

Please use due diligence.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">=====</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is apparent from the selections that this list (C-List) is for yield-hungry DGI investors. The yield goes up to 7.9%. However, please note that this list is not for conservative investors. As you can see, the average credit rating of this set of companies is much lower than the A-List or even the B-List. Dividends are moderately safe in this list, but not nearly as safe as in the A-List or B-list. At least a couple of companies in this list come with an elevated level of risk, as they are turnaround stories. We urge due diligence to determine if it would suit your personal situation. Nothing comes for free, so there will be more risk involved with this group. Even then, it's a diversified group spread among five different industry segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>UPS (United Parcel Service)</strong>:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">UPS is one of two duopolies in the logistics sector in the US (the other one is FedEx). In fact, there are only three major multinational firms in the world: UPS, FedEx, and DHL (based in Europe). However, the company's share price has lost nearly 40% of its value during the last 52 weeks. Due to the falling share price, the dividend yield has gone up a lot (currently at 7.5%). At the same time, the payout ratio is uncomfortably high at over 80%. The negative sentiment is a combination of many factors. First, it is in the process of ramping down the Amazon package business, as the margins were very thin. Secondly, the tariff-related concerns, especially with the expiry of the tariff exemption on de-minimis packages, have added to the woes. Thirdly, the agreement negotiated by UPS with its employee unions in 2023 is proving to be expensive and driving wage cost inflation. The company is undertaking downsizing and cost-cutting initiatives; however, it is yet to be seen how successful they will be. On the positive side, UPS maintains a solid balance sheet and maintains an excellent credit rating of 'A' from the S&amp;P. Its debt is relatively high but manageable. As per Morningstar, the share price is nearly 20% below its fair value, even after Morningstar lowered its fair-value estimates. The current yield of 7.5% is nearly two and a half times its long-term 5-year average of 3.1%. Even though the company has termed the dividend as \"rock-solid\" in the last earnings call, it is not reassuring when the payout ratio is reaching nearly 90% of earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, the company is more of a turnaround story right now, and this is the high-risk, high-reward stock. However, we believe patient investors are likely to be rewarded as the shares appear to be at or near the bottom, but the execution risk remains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: We would like to caution that each company comes with certain risks and concerns. Sometimes, these risks are real, but other times, they may be a bit overblown and temporary.

However, there may be multiple names for some of the sectors. The stats for the group of 9 are as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average yield: 5.89%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average discount (from 52WK High): -18.2%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average 5-yr dividend growth: 12.2%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average Payout Ratio: 62%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average Total Quality Score: 65.7</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Table 2:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1428\" data-height=\"243\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T2\" width=\"640\" height=\"109\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/434815-17617431055806453_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, we have presented three groups of dividend-paying stocks (five each) with different goals in mind to suit the varying needs of a wider audience. Even though the risk profile of each group is different, each group in itself is fairly balanced and diversified.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month, the first group yields 4.1%, while the second group elevates the yield to 5.3%. We also presented a C-list for yield-hungry investors with a 7.9% yield. The combined group (all three lists combined with duplication removed) offers an even more diversified group with nine positions and a 5.9% yield.</p>",
