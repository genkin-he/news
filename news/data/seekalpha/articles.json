Brands, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YUM\" title=\"Yum! Brands, Inc.\">YUM</a></span>) will report <a href=\"https://investors.yum.com/news-events/financial-releases/news-details/2025/Yum-Brands-Announces-Q3-2025-Earnings-and-Conference-Call-Details/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 FY25</a> earnings pre-market on Tuesday, November 4th. Going into earnings, I am slightly bullish, but not expecting any huge movement. I will be looking for Pizza Hut<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and Taco Bell to maintain momentum or show modest improvements, and KFC’s international segment to show steady unit growth. Shares are currently trading around $140 and appear to have expectations for modest growth already baked in. The key topics to watch will be around value menu demand, margin pressure from labor inflation, and tech stack execution.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Setup</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum will release earnings at 7:00 a.m. EST, Tuesday, November 4th, followed by a conference call at 8:15 a.m. EST. Yum stock has stayed relatively flat since its last earnings call, and is up around 5% since the start of the year. Going into the release, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/yum/earnings\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus estimate</a> EPS of $1.49, revenue of $1.94B, and sales growth of 5%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Snapshot</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum! Brands is the company behind Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger. They operate over <a href=\"https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/company\" rel=\"nofollow\">61,000 franchised and company-owned restaurants</a> (98% franchised). <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/890585342/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Yum-Brands-Q4-24-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Last year,</a> Yum returned $7.57B in revenue with KFC accounting for $3.10B (41%), followed by Taco Bell with $2.86B (38%), Pizza Hut with $1.01B (13%), and The Habit Burger Grill with $600M (8%). <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/890585342/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Yum-Brands-Q2-25-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">In Q2</a>, digital system sales surpassed $9B. This marked an increase to 57% digital mix of orders. Customers are increasingly choosing to pivot toward the higher-margin mobile, delivery, and pickup channels. Yum’s strength compared to their peers like Restaurant Brands International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QSR\" title=\"Restaurant Brands International Inc.\">QSR</a>) and McDonald’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) is in their steady growth and new store expansion, but their margins are thinner than those of their competitors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What To Watch</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>KFC International Pipeline:</strong> After KFC opened over 550 new locations in Q2 across 58 countries, it will be important to listen for commentary on 2026 openings, specifically in Asia and Latin America. International expansion is crucial for measuring franchise partners' confidence in Yum! Brands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Same-Store Sales:</strong> Market will be looking for KFC to expand unit sales at a solid pace and for Taco Bell to post small same-store sales growth in line with past quarters. Value promotions are expected to increase now and will be necessary for traffic to hold up.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Tech Efficiency:</strong> Watch for commentary on the rollout of “Byte by Yum!”, Yum’s internal AI system, to see if their investment in AI is accelerating labor or delivery-cost efficiencies.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Commodity Cost:</strong> Last quarter inflation on protein, cheese, and labor was a stumbling block for Yum. Watch for a lift in margins from a greater digital mix.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that Yum’s near-term performance will rely on how effectively it manages price-value perceptions amid a cautious US consumer. A key value in protecting this perception will be <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taco-bell-expands-luxe-value-154409314.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taco Bell’s value menu remaining a key traffic driver</a>. Additionally, I believe success in KFC’s international expansion will be necessary for offsetting potentially modest domestic softness. A major long-term growth driver in the business will be margin improvements driven by easing input costs, growing digital mix, and AI implementation. Management’s commentary on \"Byte by Yum!\" will be key in driving this sentiment. Evidence of early labor efficiencies or order throughput from AI integration will majorly help in seeing the long-term growth story at Yum. The defensive nature of Yum’s brands gives confidence that there is limited downside risk going into earnings. To see any meaningful upside, Yum would likely need to report same-store sales growth greater than 3% and stronger than expected international unit growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Context Going Into Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Yum’s last earnings call for Q2 FY25, Yum reported total sales growth of 4%. Taco Bell’s same-store sales grew 4% and KFC 5%. They mentioned that the consumer value was a priority and that supply chain pressures were easing steadily. The key question going into Q3 will be whether Yum can maintain their same-store sales momentum despite consumer price sensitivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the <a href=\"https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/qsr-s-traffic-woes-may-be-driven-by-deal-fatigue\" rel=\"nofollow\">quick-service restaurant industry experiencing a 3.4%</a> decline year over year, Yum has been able to maintain steady sales growth. This perseverance highlights the strength of pricing power in its leading brands. Yum! Brands are likely capturing share from smaller operators, evidenced by the negative transaction counts of US quick-service peers. Yum has been able to preserve profitability even in these periods of soft volume due to their combination of scale, franchising model, and strong brand equity. These qualities separate Yum from their peers and are justification for its premium valuation to their restaurant peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using a discounted cash flow approach with a 6.8% WACC and a 2.25% terminal growth rate, I estimate Yum! Brands’ intrinsic value is at $173 per share. This represents a roughly 24% upside from the current share price of $139.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I calculated a 6.8% WACC reflecting Yum’s roughly 76% equity and 24% debt capital structure, a beta of 0.72, and a 4.0% risk-free rate. I applied a market risk premium of 3.85%, consistent with mature US consumer discretionary peers. I used a 4.33% pre-tax cost of debt and a 15% effective tax rate, in line with the company’s historical filings and guidance. Finally, I assumed a 2.25% terminal growth rate to reflect the long-term inflation and global GDP growth expectations relevant to a diversified fast food operator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The revenue growth assumptions of 6% falling to 5% by 2029 reflect moderate international expansion and steady system sales. I assume EBIT margins are rising from 34% up to 36% as Yum recognizes operational efficiencies from AI and leverage from digital ordering becoming more popular. Capital Expenditures, depreciation, and changes in NWC were modeled at 3%, 2%, and 1% of sales, respectively, consistent with Yum’s asset-light, franchise structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, Yum trades at $139. Based on my DCF calculations, I believe the fair value is near $170-$180 per share. The sensitivity analysis shows an intrinsic value ranging from $150 - $190 under reasonable adjustments to the discount rate and terminal growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793180731606_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"872\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793180731606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Yum!

Brands DCF Valuation <span>(Matthew Doherty Excel)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This valuation supports a moderate buy rating. Yum has a solid base for long-term compounding formed by their durable franchise cash flows and growing digital sales mix. The key factor from this point in getting Yum to reach this price target will be dependent on management’s ability to sustain same-store sales growth and margin gains across KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut’s international segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793074904059_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53731215-1761793074904059_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Yum!

Brands DCF Sensitivity Analysis <span>(Matthew Doherty Excel)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum currently trades at 28x earnings, close to Restaurant Brands International’s multiple, operator of chains like Popeyes and Burger King, and below the premium valuation of McDonald’s and Chipotle. At this current valuation, the market is confident in Yum’s steady earnings growth and global scale. Their valuation reflects slower anticipated near-term growth compared to the higher multiple peers like Chipotle. Pricing is consistent with expectations for mid-single-digit sales growth and stable margins. There is an opportunity surprise on the upside through digital efficiencies or an outperformance in their international expansion.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Company</td> <td>Ticker</td> <td>Market Cap ($B)</td> <td>P/E (TTM)</td> <td>EV/EBITDA (NTM)</td> <td>Dividend Yield</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Yum!

A softer consumer could limit unit expansion, especially in emerging markets where Yum has been most aggressive. Margin pressure caused by delays or lack of success in the rollout of “Byte by Yum!” or commodity/labor inflation remains a concern. Additionally, foreign exchange volatility or regulatory hurdles will be important to watch as they could negatively impact unit growth and overall profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Read-Through</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum’s earnings report will provide useful information in understanding the health of the value-oriented US consumer. In a recent report from <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deloitte</a>, they found that consumers' financial confidence was decreasing, and they were choosing to make more selective spending decisions. In an article from <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/20/low-income-spending-economy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Washington Post</a></em>, they noted that lower-income Americans were sharply trimming spending. The overall economy and consumer spending are more reliant on the top percentage of earners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum serves consumers who are focused on value. Their earnings print will give us a look into whether broader consumer stress is now creeping in. Taco Bell and KFC delivering resilient consumer traffic and spend would suggest value dining remains a durable corner of consumer behavior. Any signs of weakness in their report may reinforce the idea of widening pressure on middle and lower-income households. This would have implications on not just Yum, but also platforms like DoorDash and similar value restaurant chains.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yum! Brands is going into this earnings report with expectations largely priced in. Expect the stock to remain near current levels if management delivers steady same-store sales growth with steady margins. A surprise to the upside will likely be dependent on progress in digital efficiencies or better-than-expected international unit sales. For long-term investors, Yum remains a durable source of consistent cash generation, with future performance mostly tied to operational execution rather than a re-rating opportunity.</p>",

You can find them on our <a href=\"https://marancapital.com/insights\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. As of the end of the third quarter, our firm’s assets under management (AUM) were approximately $47 million. Welcome, new partners.</p> <h2>Explore/Exploit: Going Rogue</h2> <p>Ants and bees are both members of the order <em>Hymenoptera</em>, whose members are typically eusocial, cooperative insects that live in large colonies that can be viewed as superorganisms. When an ant finds an attractive source of food, it leaves a pheromone trail on its way back to its nest that other ants can follow. Bees use a different strategy to alert their compatriots to good finds. They fly back to the hive and do what entomologists have dubbed a “waggle dance.”<sup>2</sup> Through these elaborate dances, bees give their peers directions to a field of newly bloomed flowers (or maybe to a picnic table after a five-year-old’s birthday party).</p> <p>But if every ant simply followed the strongest pheromone trail to the best food source, that food source would eventually run out, and the ant colony would be at a loss. And if every bee simply followed the directions imparted by the most dynamic waggle dance, a beehive would likewise exhaust this resource.</p> <p>Fortunately, some ants and bees have a rogue streak. These intrepid individuals will deviate—veer off from the pheromone trail or shun the directions of the waggle dance—and seek fortune and glory on their own in search of new sources of nectar, honeydew, syrup, or sap.</p> <p>Evolution through natural selection has fine-tuned this balance; most ants and bees follow the proverbial herd (or, in this case, swarm, hive, colony, or army) and target a known food source. But a smaller group will launch out on their own and seek novel sources of food.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman of advertising agency Ogilvy, discussed this in his fun, wide-ranging book, <em>Alchemy: The Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life</em>:</p> <p><em>There is a parallel in the behaviour of bees, which do not make the most of the system they have evolved to collect nectar and pollen. Although they have an efficient way of communicating about the direction of reliable food sources, the waggle dance, a significant proportion of the hive seems to ignore it altogether and journeys off at random. In the short term, the hive would be better off if all bees slavishly followed the waggle dance, and for a time this random behaviour baffled scientists, who wondered why 20 million years of bee evolution had not enforced a greater level of behavioural compliance. However, what they discovered was fascinating: without these rogue bees, the hive would get stuck in what complexity theorists call ‘a local maximum’; they would be so efficient at collecting food from known sources that, once these existing sources of food dried up, they wouldn’t know where to go next and the hive would starve to death. So the rogue bees are, in a sense, the hive’s research and development function, and their inefficiency pays off handsomely when they discover a fresh source of food. It is precisely because they do not concentrate exclusively on short-term efficiency that bees have survived so many million years.</em><sup>4</sup></p> <p>The manner in which ants and bees divide their resources is among a class of ideas that have been dubbed e<em>xplore/exploit </em>problems by zoologists, economists, and computer scientists.<sup>5</sup> Questions related to these problems and their cousins—<em>optimal stopping </em>problems—range from the personal to scientific to corporate realms.</p> <p>How much time should one spend exploring for new sources of food, information, or ideas before shifting to exploiting the current best source? Should one remain in the dating pool or pop the question and seek to settle down? Should a company continue to refine a product or launch it as it is? How much should be spent on R&amp;D in search of new drug candidates vs. on marketing existing products? And as in the classic framing of one <em>optimal stopping </em>problem, how many potential secretaries<sup>6</sup> should one interview before making one an offer of employment?</p> <p>Of course, portfolio managers are faced with similar types of questions. We must determine how we allocate one finite resource—time—between <em>exploring </em>for new investment ideas (and new types of investment ideas) and monitoring, researching, and generally sticking with (<em>exploiting</em>) our existing strategies and positions. Should we follow the herd or veer off on our own? Just how patient should we be with what we have? We must also determine how to allocate another finite resource—our current capital base—amongst a plethora of potential investments. Leverage, cash balances, correlation, and position sizing all factor into the decisions.</p> <p>While economists have come up with optimized algorithms for certain modeled scenarios—the Gittins index, for example, or the 37% rule for the secretary problem—the real world is messy and, as you may have suspected, as analytical as I may be, I do not believe in an algorithmic approach to research, position sizing, or portfolio management.</p> <h2>Wide Funnel, High Bar</h2> <p>Unlike bees, we investors can spend the majority of our time exploring for new investment ideas while simultaneously “exploiting” our existing positions. Sure, we must spend time monitoring and doing ongoing research on our holdings, but at least in a concentrated portfolio like ours, we are left with a lot of time to be on the hunt. I am frequently asked about my approach to sourcing new ideas. The top of our funnel is very broad. I do small amounts of reading, research, and valuation work on a large number of companies. But the real meat of our process comes in the middle of the proverbial funnel—the winnowing down of potential investments from a large list of possibilities to a small, concentrated portfolio of best ideas.</p> <p>I have been investing for my entire career—over 20 years now—so there are many companies, sectors, management teams, and business models that I know well or am familiar with. In addition to following many of these on an ongoing basis, I study many new special situations and event-driven setups as they arise: mergers, spin-offs, reverse-Morris Trust transactions, tenders, rights offerings, and various other sources of corporate change (and thus potential for mis-valuation and catalysts). I am well versed in special situations research, which frequently involves studying proxies, S-1s, S-3s, 8-Ks, 10-Ks, 13Ds, Section 16 filings, PACER filings, and the rest of the alphabet soup of regulatory filings that apply.</p> <p>There are elements to our top-of-the-funnel process that are systematic: The review of various classes of special situations, for example. But like rogue ants and bees, I allow for a large amount of room for serendipity and following my nose. We are not investing in the same types of investments as most funds.</p> <p>While the top of our funnel is wide and allows for variation, the bar for a stock’s inclusion in the portfolio is always very high. When interviewing secretaries, it is unlikely that one will be a hundred times better than others; after getting a feel for the field, one can make a decision and offer a job. But in investing, a fantastic investment can indeed be orders of magnitude better than an average one, so it is worth having a certain amount of patience. On the flip side, our bar can’t be so high that nothing ever meets it. The perfect is the enemy of the good enough.</p> <p>We therefore utilize the concept of a threshold approach: As I have previously discussed, we typically underwrite for an expected IRR of at least 25% (I have famed this as seeking “three-year doubles” or better) with limited risk of permanent capital loss on the downside. While it is easy to focus on the first half of this target (the threshold IRR), the second half (limited downside) is every bit as important. This is why you will tend to see less levered (or net cash) companies in our portfolio. You will also see quality, growth, modest valuations, and, frequently, catalysts.</p> <p>A mid-20s IRR is a high bar, and to be clear, we don’t necessarily expect to generate fund-level returns at that rate. We strive to generate excellent risk-adjusted returns, but we’ll invariably get some stocks wrong along the way or some stocks will take longer than we think to achieve fair value. But by aiming high, we have achieved a ~20% annualized gross return (and therefore mid-to-high teens net return, depending on share class) since inception.<sup>7</sup></p> <h2>Market Backdrop &amp; Portfolio Update</h2> <p>Our top five positions as of the end of the quarter were Clarus Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLAR\" title=\"Clarus Corporation\">CLAR</a>), Correios de Portugal, S.A. (Euronext Lisbon: CTT)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTTPY\" title=\"CTT - Correios De Portugal, S.A.\">OTCPK:CTTPY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTTOF\" title=\"CTT - Correios De Portugal, S.A.\">OTCPK:CTTOF</a>), Horizon Kinetics Holding Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HKHC\" title=\"Horizon Kinetics Holding Corporation\">OTCPK:HKHC</a>), Turning Point Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TPB\" title=\"Turning Point Brands, Inc.\">TPB</a>), and an undisclosed position.<sup>8</sup> You will find none of these companies in broad market indices such as the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>IPO and capital markets activity—including the return of SPACs—has picked up, and there are pockets of froth in the market. A major investment bank recently distributed a list of “meme” stocks; it was comprised of more than 60 companies. AI, quantum, nuclear, rare earth, and space-related stocks are attracting significant speculative capital, regardless of business model quality. As usual, we have no “fear of missing out” (FOMO) on these types of stocks. There is always <em>something </em>we are missing out on, and we are okay with that. There are enough attractively priced companies in the market outside of the bubble areas. We have demonstrated that we can generate solid returns while generally avoiding tech and other trendy sectors.</p> <p>Meme stocks and momentum sectors aside, even many of the highest quality companies in the market do not appear to be inexpensive. Remember, investing is not simply about identifying the best companies. It is easy to note that (at least six of) the Magnificent Seven companies are dominant in their fields. The important question for those that own these stocks, though, is whether they are attractively priced.</p> <p>Steve Mandel, who runs the hedge fund Lone Pine, has been quoted as saying, “I don’t need an analyst to tell me whether a 10x PE stock is cheap; I need one to tell me whether a 40x PE stock is cheap.” We can flip this framing: We don’t need analysts to tell us whether a 40x PE company is quality or growing or loved; we should ask whether a single digit PE stock is quality or growing or can one day be loved. When we find one of these (like APi Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APG\" title=\"APi Group Corporation\">APG</a>), Turning Point Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TPB\" title=\"Turning Point Brands, Inc.\">TPB</a>), or Cadre Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDRE\" title=\"Cadre Holdings, Inc.\">CDRE</a>), among others in our portfolio), I get excited.</p> <p>As I caution in most letters, our portfolio may behave quite differently than the broader market indices over the short term (especially during periods of bubbles and froth in the markets). Unfortunately, we are going through a period this month in which our fund is down while various market indices are up. Several of our core positions have pulled back not due to ascertainable fundamental reasons, but seemingly on account of motivated sellers (perhaps, in some cases, mutual fund tax loss sellers ahead of their fiscal year-ends).</p> <p>I view this recent weakness as an opportunity. I believe our portfolio is attractive and that a number of our core positions have upcoming catalysts. With the appropriate long-term time horizon, I’m confident in our portfolio and approach.</p> <p>I have been working hard on a new idea over the past few quarters, and this position is now in our top five. While I cannot yet discuss it publicly, I look forward to sharing more on this investment in my next letter.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Long-term clients, as well as those who joined in the last quarter: Thank you. I truly appreciate your trust and support. Your alignment and long-term orientation allow me to invest in the manner that I believe will maximize our risk-adjusted returns. I look forward to writing to you again in the new year. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out if you would like to discuss any aspect of the partnership.</p> <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p> <p><strong>Dan Roller</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><sup>1</sup> Net returns based on the fund’s standard fee share class.

Here is a <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/psychology-of-human-misjudgment-by-charlie-munger\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a> to a reprint of the speech. While the whole thing is worth re-reading, you can find the section I’m referring to by searching the speech for the term “honeybee.”</p> <p><sup>3</sup> This description of the phenomenon (Rogue bees! Intrepid ants!), while compelling, is not exactly right. Closer to the truth: Waggle dances can only be so precise; pheromone trails wear out; some ants or bees just get lost or distracted. But one way or another, these groups split their resources between harvesting a known food source and searching for new ones.</p> <p><sup>4</sup> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12271814-there-is-a-parallel-in-the-behaviour-of-bees-which\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p> <p><sup>5</sup> For further good discussion of this and related topics, I enjoyed <em>Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions </em>by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths.</p> <p><sup>6</sup> The <em>secretary </em>problem’s roots trace to at least 1949 (if not prior to that, in various forms), which explains the less politically correct—yet most well-known—name of the problem.

Adjusted EBITDA rose 16% to $122 million. Meanwhile, the profit margin widened by 120 basis points to 26.8%, the highest quarterly margin since the Elkay merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the call, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> the results came from higher volume and the steady daily grind of the <a href=\"https://zurnelkay.com/how-we-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zurn Elkay Business System</a>. Pricing added about five percentage points, and unit volumes grew too, which is a good tell that indicates that real demand is present and not just higher prices that's driving these results. At the same time, about $8 million in customer orders were moved up into September ahead of a planned price increase. Even so, management said their guidance assumes that timing will balance out in the fourth quarter, not artificially boost the growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonresidential business stayed <a href=\"https://www.construction.com/company-news/dodge-momentum-index-increases-3-in-september/\" rel=\"nofollow\">strong</a>, while residential stayed <a href=\"https://www.aia.org/resource-center/abi-september-2025-weakness-persists-architecture-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\">weak</a>. That might sound typical, but you have to keep in mind that Zurn Elkay has a bigger presence in education, health care, and public spaces, and these are areas where drinking water solutions are now seen as <em>required</em> items. In other words, state rules are turning into real purchase orders, which drives steady demand in those segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/drinking-water-and-environmental-health/school-drinking-water-program/filter-first\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michigan’s Filter First law</a>. It set aside $50 million for schools and child care centers, with hard deadlines to finish the job. A statewide grant program has also been established in the state of <a href=\"https://njpsa.org/recent-legislation-affecting-new-jersey-public-schools-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Jersey</a>, which establishes precise timetables for guidance, bidding, and installation. Operationally, the point is that these programs build deadline-driven, budgeted demand that isn’t tied to new construction, and naturally, they're going to favor those suppliers already certified and on site.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s profits and cash generation seemed to be the main drivers this quarter. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Free cash flow</a> came in at $94 million. So far this year, sales have increased by $93 million, and EBITDA has gone up by $39 million, meaning about 42% of the extra sales turned into profit. The year-to-date EBITDA margin is also up by 1.2 percentage points, on top of 8% core growth, and that's exactly the kind of improvement I want to see when overall market demand isn’t providing much help.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1968\" data-height=\"980\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"3Q CY25 Earnings Slides\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-17618273468886027_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">3Q CY25 Earnings Slides <span>(ZSW)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Net leverage</a> dropped to just 0.6x, the lowest level since the company went public, which buys optionality.

Essentially, by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">shutting down</a> its U.S. pension plan and shedding roughly $200 million in liabilities, the company simplified its balance sheet and made future management easier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zurn Elkay: Pricing Discipline and Regulatory Fit</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having noted that, costs have gone up. Back in August, new rules added a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-issues-blitz-tariff-announcements-copper-brazil-south-korea-small-value-2025-07-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">50% tariff</a> on some partly processed copper imports. And because of that, management now expects to pay around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$50 million in tariffs</a>; that's higher than their earlier estimate of around $35–45 million. Despite that, the company acted early to offset this. It raised list prices in April, which affected the entire next quarter, and made another adjustment in mid-September to update rates for each country and for copper materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the call, the CFO <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">explained</a> that the price benefit should show up in the first half of next year, which will help revenues during those quarters. Keep in mind, those price increases don’t boost results overnight; it takes a bit for them to fully flow through the numbers, so the first half of 2026 will likely look stronger as the effects of those higher prices continue to show up. By the second half of 2026, that effect will fade. After a full year of higher prices, it just becomes the new <em>normal</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, let's go back to the regulation environment since the company's product features and government rules worked together in a good way. If you aren't aware, schools and districts require filters that meet <a href=\"https://info.nsf.org/Certified/dwtu/listings_leadreduction.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">NSF/ANSI Standard 53</a> for removing lead and Standard 42 for improving taste and removing particles. In certain cases, some bid lists also ask for <a href=\"https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/nsf-ansi-42-53-and-401-filtration-systems-standards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Standards</a> 372 and 401, which deal with low lead content and microplastic removal. Elkay’s main bottle fillers and filters already meet all these standards. My read, which is grounded in the numbers we just went over, is that once customers standardize on Zurn Elkay’s systems, they tend to stay there. Therefore, when new funding shows up, the buying happens fast—no long comparison shopping, just orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Elkay Pro Filtration</a> gained early success because its filters are quicker to install and last longer. I'd argue that that could be a big help for maintenance teams already stretched thin while trying to meet safety rules across many locations. Liv EZ, the new built-in water bottle filler for homes, is a smaller side project. The company isn’t depending on home sales for growth, but this product brings Elkay’s strong commercial-grade filtration into homes, where people already know and trust the brand from places like schools and offices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balanced Outlook for 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to the company’s outlook, it does strike a balance between optimism and <em>caution</em>. In the first nine months, order rates were just slightly higher than shipments, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">management expects</a> the fourth quarter to be about even, meaning they plan to produce only what customers actually need, not oversupply distributors. As for the fourth quarter, the company's projecting core sales growth in the high single digits and adjusted earnings (EBITDA) between $99 million and $102 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full year, the company expects about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834941-zurn-elkay-water-solutions-corporation-zws-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">8% growth in core sales</a>, EBITDA between $437 million and $440 million, and more than $300 million in free cash flow. The overall message seems to fit the broader economy; that is, commercial construction isn’t <em>booming, and</em> financing remains tight, but I'd say that the company’s own growth drivers are strong enough to keep business steadily building even without a surge in new projects.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zurn Elkay’s Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1570\" data-height=\"445\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ZSW's valuation metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"181\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"181\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47303334-1761827783925331_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Trade uncertainty was partially mitigated by reciprocal tariff arrangements, a 90-day postponement on China tariffs, and bilateral deals. The Federal Reserve began its rate cutting cycle with a 25 basis point reduction in September, with updated projections indicating an additional 50 basis points of cuts expected before year end. Concerns about Fed independence surfaced when the administration announced plans to fire Fed Governor Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Treasury yields fluctuated throughout the period, with short-end yields declining approximately 30-40 basis points as rate-cut expectations increased. The curve steepened with the 30-year yield falling 7 basis points since the start of the quarter. Despite weakening labor market indicators, including the narrowest labor market differential since early 2021 in the September Consumer Confidence survey, economic data remained positive, supporting narratives of consumer resilience, improved trade clarity, and stronger corporate capital expenditure. As the quarter ended, the federal government faced an imminent shutdown with no funding deal reached by September 30.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third Quarter 2025 Performance Highlights</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In 3Q25 the portfolio (I share class) returned 2.34%, 31 basis points ahead of the Bloomberg U.S. Universal Index. Year to date the portfolio (I share class) returned 6.57%, 44 basis points ahead of the index.</li> <li>Sector allocation and security selection contributed positively to relative outperformance with the portfolio’s treasury underweight and security selection within corporate bonds providing uplift of 11 and 6 basis points, respectively. Specifically, the portfolio’s security selection within corporates and CMO’s resulted in strong contributions to relative performance.</li> </ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>The portfolio maintained an average duration of 6.27 versus 6.03 for the index with the overweight duration and yield curve positioning contributing 4 basis points from relative performance for the quarter. Rates across the board fell in Q3 and the curve continued to steepen with short-end rates falling 30-40 basis points and the long end falling 8-10 basis points.</li></ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Positioning and Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strategy remained positioned with a longer duration and higher quality bias compared to its long-term range, driven by attractive real yields and tight credit spreads. Security selection, driven by our bottom-up fundamental credit research, was a key contributor, allowing us to identify resilient issuers across various sectors and industries. Corporate credit spreads tightened significantly, approaching levels not seen since the 1990s, and we remain cautious on adding incremental credit risk as the compensation for doing so remains near historic lows. Real yields remain attractive relative to history, compensating investors for fiscal largesse, government dysfunction (shutdowns), and persistent inflation. While nimbleness around duration positioning remains important, interest rate volatility has been trending lower, perhaps suppressed by reduced government data flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We maintained broad diversification across fixed-income sectors with an emphasis on sectors demonstrating resilience or offering compelling risk/reward profiles identified through our research. The allocations to investment grade corporate credit and mortgage pass- throughs were large drivers of absolute returns during the period, however falling yields led to Treasuries outperforming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the global economy has shown surprising resilience despite mounting pressures from the delayed impact of tariffs and constrained fiscal flexibility. Additionally, the Fed must balance relatively persistent inflation with downside risks to the labor market alongside uncertainty surrounding the independence of the country’s institutions. With flexible mandates across many of our fixed income strategies—enabling us to dynamically adjust duration, credit exposure, and sector allocation—we remain positioned to take advantage of potential bouts of heightened volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Average Annual Total Returns (As Of 30 September 2025)</em></strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>EXPENSE RATIOS (%)</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>THORNBURG</strong><strong>CORE</strong><strong>PLUS</strong><strong>BOND FUND</strong></p></td> <td><p>QTR</p></td> <td><p>YTD</p></td> <td><p>1-YR</p></td> <td><p>ITD</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>GROSS</p></td> <td><p>NET</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>A Shares THCAX (Incep: 2 Oct 23)</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td rowspan=\"4\"> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Without sales charge</p></td> <td><p>2.27</p></td> <td><p>6.37</p></td> <td><p>3.05</p></td> <td><p>7.68</p></td> <td><p>--</p></td> <td><p>--</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>With sales charge</p></td> <td><p>-2.32</p></td> <td><p>1.62</p></td> <td><p>-1.63</p></td> <td><p>5.23</p></td> <td><p>10.92</p></td> <td><p>0.75</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>I Shares THCIX (Incep: 2 Oct 23)</p></td> <td><p>2.34</p></td> <td><p>6.57</p></td> <td><p>3.35</p></td> <td><p>7.98</p></td> <td><p>1.11</p></td> <td><p>0.50</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index (Since: 2 Oct 23)</p></td> <td><p>2.03</p></td> <td><p>6.13</p></td> <td><p>2.88</p></td> <td><p>7.52</p></td> <td colspan=\"3\"> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Returns for less than one year are not annualized.

This information should not be relied upon as a recommendation or investment advice and is not intended to predict the performance of any investment or market.</p> <p>Investments carry risks, including possible loss of principal. Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise. This effect is more pronounced for longer-term bonds. Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Investments in lower rated and unrated bonds may be more sensitive to default, downgrades, and market volatility; these investments may also be less liquid than higher rated bonds. Investments in derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the securities or other assets underlying the pool of securities, including illiquidity and difficulty in valuation. Investments in equity securities are subject to additional risks, such as greater market fluctuations. Additional risks may be associated with investments outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations, illiquidity, volatility, and political and economic risks.

These debt obligations are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the government and issued at various schedules and maturities. Income from Treasury securities is exempt from state and local, but not federal, taxes.</p> <p>A bond credit rating assesses the financial ability of a debt issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Ratings of AAA (the highest), AA, A, and BBB are investment-grade quality. Ratings of BB, B, CCC, CC, C and D (the lowest) are considered below investment grade, speculative grade, or junk bonds.</p> <p>Credit Spread/Quality Spread - The difference between the yields of securities with different credit qualities.</p> <p>Duration - A bond's sensitivity to interest rates. Bonds with longer durations experience greater price volatility than bonds with shorter durations. Yield Curve - A line that plots the interest rates, at a set point in time, of bonds having equal credit quality, but differing maturity dates.</p> <p>Asset-backed Security (ABS) - A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or \"backed\") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets that are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors, a process called securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets.</p> <p>Mortgage Pass-Through - A security consisting of a pool of residential mortgage loans. Payments of principal, interest and prepayments are \"passed through\" to investors each month.</p> <p>The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index (BBG US Agg TR Value) is composed of approximately 8,000 publicly traded bonds including U.S. government, mortgage-backed, corporate and Yankee bonds.

Just 22% of the fund is classified as large caps, while there is a slight lean toward the growth style over value.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>On valuation, KCE still looks compelling in my view. The price-to-earnings ratio is now 16.2x. While that’s above the 14.8x multiple from early May, it still appears favorable compared to the long-term earnings growth rate of 13.2%.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">KCE: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"925\" data-height=\"735\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"KCE: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"509\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184036331277_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>As for the sector breakdown, KCE is, of course, almost exclusively Financials.

Notice in the chart below that shares are approaching critical support levels. First, the long-term 200-day moving average is on the rise, suggesting that the bulls control the primary trend. Additionally, the 200dma is just a few percentage points below the current level. Second, there’s a downside gap in the high $130s that would mark a key technical buying spot.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph. It has been trending lower since July. Note that the RSI peaked well before the price made a high (as is commonly the case). Today, the RSI has made a higher low compared to the mid-October trough. Still, the bulls have their work cut out for them, given a significant amount of volume by price up to the $158 resistance spot.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">KCE: Key Support In Play, Possible RSI Improvement, Rising 200dma</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"553\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"KCE: Key Support In Play, Possible RSI Improvement, Rising 200dma\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/36131525-17618184035627582_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The Bottom Line</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I have a <span>\"B</span>uy\" rating on KCE.

That sets the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> foundation for what’s turning out to be one of the strongest quarterly reporting periods in years. What’s more, S&amp;P 500 consensus EPS estimates for the next 12 months are closing in on $300 for the first time.</span><sup class=\"paywall-full-content\">1</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The SPX’s ascent to 6800+ yields a P/E ratio just below 23x. In short, both price and profits are in rally mode, which the bulls are happy to see. Meanwhile, volatility across the stock and bond markets has cooled after a mid-October scare that saw the Cboe Volatility Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIX\" title=\"S&amp;P VIX Index\">VIX</a>) spike near 29. It’s back in the mid-teens now, just as the ICE BofA MOVE Index of Treasury volatility sputters close to 47-month lows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bond market gets its time in the spotlight today, Fed Day, of course. Yields have eased since May, thanks in part to gradually softening economic uncertainty. The macro backdrop is not pristine, but stocks seem to be pricing in a Goldilocks scenario. Big tech, big banks, and the man with the biggest net worth are in focus this week, not from an earnings perspective but from several potentially revealing shareholder events.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">November 4-5: Lam Research and KLA, Two Semiconductor Bellwethers, Take the Stage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chips are in focus on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. The days may be getting darker (for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere), but times have seemingly never been brighter within semiconductors. Both Lam Research (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX\" title=\"Lam Research Corporation\">LRCX</a>) and KLA Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAC\" title=\"KLA Corporation\">KLAC</a>) are in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMH\" title=\"VanEck Semiconductor ETF\">SMH</a>). The fund has more than doubled off its April low, and all eyes will soon be on NVIDIA’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) fiscal Q3 2026 earnings report due out on Wednesday, November 19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before that, Lam (virtually) hosts its Annual Meeting of Stockholders next Tuesday. There, shareholders could hear about new capital allocation decisions, which is particularly interesting right now given the heavy investment in AI and semiconductor manufacturing. Lam reported its fiscal Q1 numbers a week ago, beating on both the top and bottom lines. Projecting resilient revenue for the year ahead (despite sagging demand out of China), it’s reasonable to expect an upbeat shareholder event.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for KLA, it reports tonight (October 29), after a slew of sell-side upgrades across the semiconductor equipment industry. Shares are higher by almost 100% on the year, and any additional clues on its order backlog or developments in China could move the stock. All the commentary sets the table for NVIDIA’s show later in the month.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">November 5: Bank of America’s First Investor Day Since 2011</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the most consequential corporate event hits next Wednesday, when Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) hosts its first Investor Day in 14 years.<sup>2</sup> The long hiatus makes this gathering particularly noteworthy. The banking industry has undergone massive changes since 2011, from the implementation of Dodd-Frank amid the zero interest rate policy era to the digital banking revolution. Today, with crypto making institutional inroads and Treasury yields dropping from multi-decade highs, there are mixed signals for the big money center banks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Brian Moynihan will presumably grab the mic and offer details on BofA’s plans to navigate the new era. He usually keeps an upbeat tone, unlike his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>). Recall that Jamie Dimon talked of cockroaches lurking behind banking walls earlier in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BofA shareholders may seek fresh clues on the health of the consumer, along with how the housing market may evolve with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dipping ever closer to a 5-handle. Furthermore, any added color on deposit trends, delinquency rates, or spending behavior will feed directly into how markets assess the health of the economy heading into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Financials sector as a whole has been sagging on an absolute and relative basis. The group was leading for much of 2024 and into the first half of this year. An optimistic tone would nicely buttress BofA’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831715-q3-earnings-season-kicks-off-major-banks-thrive-while-regional-lenders-signal-trouble\" rel=\"noopener\">big earnings beat</a> two weeks ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">November 6: Tesla Shareholders Have Their Say</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If BofA’s Investor Day is the C-SPAN of key corporate events in early November, Tesla’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>) shareholder meeting is like <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>. The list of key agenda items will be long, but surely the most anticipated is the vote on Elon Musk’s enormous proposed pay package.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s board asks equityholders to approve a performance-based compensation award for the world’s richest person. It also stresses that if the package is not approved, the EV automaker - with its valuation pinned to robotics and AI - risks losing Musk’s “time, energy, and considerable talents.”<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s estimated that if the ambitious milestones are met, the package could net Musk a staggering $1 trillion in equity. That would require a TSLA market cap of a seemingly out-of-reach $8.5 trillion, along with other operational and strategic targets.<sup>4</sup> If it’s not given a thumbs-up, Musk could retaliate or make other threats as the firm’s clear leader.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The shareholder meeting transcends Tesla and Musk, though.

The ETF, owned by Vanguard, invests in US government bonds denominated in dollars, with intermediate maturities of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> between 3 and 7 years usually, with an expense ratio of 0.03%. This means that in this vehicle everything revolves around the movement of the yields of the treasury and the coupons that pay those bonds. In this case there are no corporate credit or mortgage instruments, which makes it easier for the reader to understand the investment universe described. Although the fund performs well overall, I believe that the conditions necessary for an optimal purchase are not in place, as the reader will appreciate in this article.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The operation of the fund is quite simple in this case. The fund collects the coupons on the bonds it holds and passes them on in the form of regular distributions to its investors. At the same time, the NAV rises or falls depending on what the Treasury IRRs do. In case they fall, the bonds are worth more and the ETF price rises; if the IRRs rise instead, the price falls. To all this must be added the roll-down effect of each bond, which is that as the bonds of the fund are maturing and managers renew them, if they do not change because the rate curve does not change, they are usually renewed at a somewhat lower IRR. This small decrease in IRR usually generates a discrete profitability bonus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sensitivity of the fund to rate movements is at a balanced point, as it has an average duration, depending on the type of bonds in which it invests. This allows the management team to manage duration risk in a more controlled way, in a more manageable way than if it were a long-term treasury fund. In a context of disinflation or less restrictive monetary policy as the current one, the 3-7 year tranche reacts well, as the price of the fund is able to pick up the understanding of returns and consequently will benefit a potential portfolio, including this type of vehicle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make this happen in an orderly fashion, Vanguard replicates an intermediate-duration Treasuries benchmark. The objective is to equalize the behavior of the index, discounting commissions, with a low tracking error. In this case, the monitoring operation combines two approaches. When liquidity allows, virtually everything in the index is bought at very close weights, resulting in complete replication. In case it is not worth having each CUSIP, the optimized sampling technique is used: which consists of buying a basket of bonds with the same characteristics as the basket of the index.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"841\" data-height=\"322\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund KPIs\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616728229505067_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the screenshot above, readers can see the different ETF data relevant to making the right decisions. Of particular note is the turnover figure of 52%. Although it is categorised as a D, this is not a bad figure. In an index ETF such as this one, bonds age and fall below three years, at which point they are removed from the index. At that time, the fund must sell them and buy longer issues to maintain the target duration. This simple ‘turnover’ generates structural rotation and justifies the turnover ratio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis - Macro Fundamental</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this section, we will analyze some macroeconomic indicators in detail to try to offer the reader an accurate perspective and a sound recommendation on the vehicle in question.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1026\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VGIT - Curve &amp; Financial Conditions\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-1760905291271349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first proposed metric shows three variables that are important for the analysis of a vehicle of this type. These variables are the shape of the rate curve (<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10\" target=\"_blank\">spread of the 10-year</a> vs. <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3\" target=\"_blank\">the 3M tranche</a>), the state of financial conditions as measured by the Chicago Federal Reserve (<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFCI\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFCI\" target=\"_blank\">NFCI</a>), and the liquidity boost, as measured by the 13-week change in the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve’s balance sheet</a>. As we can see in the graph, when the curve is reversed more, the market usually discounts situations of economic slowdown or rate cuts in the near future, which pushes down the IRRs of the 3-7 year stretch, which is where the analyzed vehicle moves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we add to this that the financial conditions are tense (NFCI), the classic “flight to quality” can appear, a situation in which the demand for treasuries increases. The third element we have, and include, is the Fed’s balance sheet. This variable gives us context in the aspect of the activity carried out by central banks. In QE situations, when central banks extract duration from the market through their asset purchase programs (bonds), they provide liquidity that often favors the maturity bracket of this type.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The signal is now at a neutral level, because the curve has undone some of the investment that it made a few quarters ago, the financial indicator (NFCI) does not indicate a severe tightening of conditions, and the Federal Reserve’s 13-week momentum is not being expansionary, at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this situation in hand, we can say that, according to this first panel, the profitability of the ETF analyzed depends now more on carry and roll-down, than on a theoretical “macro rally” (decrease in real rates, more inverted curve, or increases in net financial liquidity).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1027\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VGIT - Nominal to Real Discount\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/19/60407943-17609052921299193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the second metric, we look at the main driver of performance for an ETF such as the one analyzed. We care mainly about the real cost of money and the inflation that discounts the market. As we can see in the graph, we have the green line, which expresses the inverted z-score of the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII5\" target=\"_blank\">real 5-year type</a>. When this line goes down, future flows are discounted at a lower cost, favoring the nominal bonds of the 3-7 year tranche, which is where the analyzed ETF operates, as they increase its price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second key element to comment on here is the 5-year breakeven line (<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE\" target=\"_blank\">T5YIE</a>), which is the variable that approximates the inflation expected by the market over that time horizon (5 years). In case this breakeven cools down, the inflation premium demanded by the investor drops, and, again, nominal IRRs tend to fall; for consistency, we also treat it as inverted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current reality is that the variables in the graph are in a neutral zone. This means that real rates are not at the local highs of a few months ago (this reduces downward pressure on the fund price), the breakeven variable does not show inflationary stress overflowing, and the “claims” element does not reflect a sharp deterioration in employment today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Features and Performance Analysis</strong></h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"429\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Comparative\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60407943-1761830504398605_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"738\" data-height=\"252\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Data\" width=\"640\" height=\"219\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/60407943-17616719338917613_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the screenshot above, we show a comparison of the performance of the VGIT ETF, as well as its main characteristics (costs, AUM, and management), compared to two other ETFs in the same category, belonging to BlackRock (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEF\" title=\"iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF\">IEF</a>) and Vanguard (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIV\" title=\"Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index Fund ETF Shares\">BIV</a>). As readers can see, the ETF analyzed outperforms its main competitor (IEF - BlackRock) in the long term. When analyzing why this is the case, we find the answer by focusing on the fees charged by each fund. The two funds managed by Vanguard charge an annual management fee of 0.03%, while BlackRock's ETF charges 0.15%. This difference is significant for us when choosing one vehicle over another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the BIV ETF, it currently outperforms both VGIT and IEF. This is because it has the longest effective duration of the three ETFs compared. BIV currently has an effective duration of 7.2 years, compared to 5.6 (VGIT) and 6.9 (IEF). This means that within the intermediate tranche, BIV invests in maturities that are slightly higher than the other two ETFs, which gives it that extra return (it is also conditioned by greater exposure to corporate credit).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this in mind, it makes sense to me to keep the vehicle in the portfolio. Readers may choose to let the monthly coupon continue to work, allowing the roll-down to accumulate and monitoring the thresholds of the variables discussed here. I recommend buying, but only if and when we see a potential catalyst for an increase in carry. Until then, stay out if you are not already in. Thank you for reading.</p>",

You slow down,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/30/fed-cut-rates-officials-disagree-on-whats-next/86964505007/\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>, referring to the postponed numbers, such as the monthly payrolls report for September which remains in hiatus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The lack of new economic numbers is “very concerning,” former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/29/powell-cuts-interest-rates-employment-inflation-trump-incompetent/\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>Fortune, </em>noting that the Fed is “flying blind.” She explained: “If policymakers build systems around data that can vanish overnight, that’s a real vulnerability for economic governance.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The special release of consumer inflation data for September showed headline CPI rising 3.0% year-over-year, the highest since January. But Powell expressed a degree of optimism that to the extent that pricing pressure is rising due to tariffs, it will be a one-time effect that won’t push up inflation much longer beyond what’s already been seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“Inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2% goal,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0p7g7560o\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>. He advised that central bankers are looking for signs that tariffs only lead to one-time price increases for certain consumer products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the uncertainty linked to delayed data, weakness in hiring will likely keep the Fed on a rate-cutting path, predicts Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. “The downside risks within the job market will likely ensure the Fed will continue to cut rates in December and throughout the next year,” he reasoned in a press release sent to CapitalSpectator.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fed's Powell Raises Doubts About Another Rate Cut\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"432\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_fed.30oct2025.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The critical variable in the days and weeks ahead is how the Treasury market reacts.

This is due to softer seaborne coal prices, increasing electricity prices in the U.S., and a potential policy shift with regards to coal from the new U.S. administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peabody is a company I have covered frequently over the last couple of years and my prior articles can be found <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=BTU\">here</a>. This article will focus on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285879-peabody-reports-results-for-quarter-ended-september-30-2025#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 2025 results</a> that was released this morning and the company is at 10 am CT today hosting a conference call, which can be joined <a href=\"https://app.webinar.net/vmXLJVLydan\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=BTU\">most recent articles</a> on Peabody have had Strong Buy ratings following an extreme selloff in conjunction with the Anglo American (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAUKF\" title=\"Anglo American plc\">OTCQX:AAUKF</a>) coal deal, that led to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTU/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> concerns by the market for Peabody. The stock price of Peabody has rallied a lot from the lows earlier this year, partly because this deal was cancelled due to a <a href=\"https://www.peabodyenergy.com/Home/Company-News-1181\" rel=\"nofollow\">material adverse change</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the strong rally from its lows, I have lowered my rating from a Strong Buy to a Buy, as the risk reward isn't as attractive at this level compared to the sub $20 that we saw during much of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, I still think Peabody is an attractive investment and it is far from expensive, with what I think mid-cycle earnings will be for the company. The U.S. thermal coal now looks to be adding very welcomed optionality, where that optionality and a depressed valuation going into the year, explains the outperformance in 2025. Peabody is up 31% year-to-date, which is impressive when we consider that the drawdown this year was as much as 50% in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 2 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618234694445024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 2 - Source: Koyfin</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 Result</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1216\" data-height=\"511\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 3 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"269\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618260212210855_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 3 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peabody reported an adjusted EBITDA of $100M in the most recent quarter and earnings per diluted share were $-0.58. Adjusted EBITDA was slightly better than expected and up 7% compared to Q2. Earnings per share were below expectation, but net income was impacted by $54M in costs related to the terminated acquisition. Overall, this was a relatively positive result even if it was still a weak quarter on a historical comparison.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Seaborne Metallurgical segment did see a rebound from the previous quarter when the EBITDA was negative in the segment. The sales price of $121/t was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, while costs of $108/t declined as much as 9% in Q3 compared to Q2. The EBITDA in the segment was a reasonably healthy $28M in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Centurion mine will start longwall mining in Q1 2026, which is expected to have lower cost, and the sales price will demand a premium for its low vol coking coal. So, this segment is likely to start generating a more substantial EBITDA in the not-too-distant future, even if the seaborne coking coal market remains somewhat subdued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"898\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 4 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"289\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618248157304506_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 4 - Source: Peabody Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Seaborne Thermal segment saw a rebound in coal sales to 4.1 million tons in Q3, the sales price in the quarter was $59.3/t, an 11% increase compared to Q2, and the EBITDA margin was $13/t in Q3.

Peabody has also been buying back its shares aggressively over the last few years, even if that has slowed lately. Once Centurion is fully ramped up and once coal prices start to normalize, my expectation is that the buybacks will ramp up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 9 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/48701869-1761478448600846_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 9 - Source: Koyfin</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are currently going through a weak period for coal prices, which relates to both thermal coal and metallurgical coal, even if we look to be off the lows earlier this year.

However, that is due to the very soft coal prices at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would argue the mid-cycle EBITDA is probably closer to $1.5B for Peabody and the enterprise value is $3.0B, which takes the EV to EBITDA to 2.0. Let's say I am overly aggressive here, and the mid-cycle EBITDA is only $1B, which Peabody was able to double during the peak in 2022, and that was without Centurion I might add. Then the EV to EBITDA would be around 3.0, which isn't particularly expensive either. The attractive valuation is primarily why I continue to rate Peabody as a Buy, and it is a core holding in my portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There will always be risks to consider as well, where the commodity price risk is the main risk to be aware of as coal prices are cyclical. While I do think coal prices need to recover from the current level, coal prices can likely stay depressed longer than most expect. The good balance sheet, liquidity, and diversified production will offset the impact some for Peabody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential risk is litigation risk following the termination of the Anglo American coal deal, where Anglo American does not agree with the material adverse change following the ignition event at one of the mines. While I do think Peabody is likely to beat this in court, there is the possibility that the courts would side with Anglo American and force Peabody to pay a substantial break-up fee.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I continue to think that the risk reward is relatively attractive for Peabody here, even if we might see some more consolidation in the near term following the strong rally over the last 6 months. Centurion will provide a very welcomed boost to earnings next year. </p>",
