The precious metal is closing well above its early February monthly highs as metals caught a strong bid in today's action. <em>These are preparations for something happening over the weekend.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Week Ahead: NFP and PMIs all around the globe</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asia Pacific Markets: A condensed data package for APAC</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week should be exciting for APAC traders. Without counting geopolitics, macro traders will await three PMI reports for China. There has been a surprising drop in the data as of late, and the PBoC is talking about supporting their economy, not through market-wide stimulus but with targeted assistance. It will be interesting to see how it plays out in the data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Australian dollar will once again be on the front scene, between inflation surveys, a speech from Governor Bullock, PMIs, trade data and GDP. It's going to be a very essential week for the 2026 FX leader. Let's see if it holds up to the test.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Japan, traders will be listening closely to Governor Ueda's speech on Monday night. A hike could be coming towards mid-month for the Bank of Japan, and he upped his tone recently regarding the possibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>With two new decision-makers entering the Bank of Japan in the next months, it could be his last opportunity to build some form of consensus.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe and UK Markets: Eurozone and Swiss Inflation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The heavy slate of data also spreads to Europe with inflation data (consumer prices and producer prices) releasing. Friday will also see the yearly data for EU GDP, so keep this one in check.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the largest culprit will be the Swiss inflation report, where traders should confirm whether negative rates will be a thing or not. A heavy test for FX markets.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">North American Markets: More PMIs, but most importantly, non farm payrolls</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week is going to be huge for North America. Without mentioning Iran, traders will receive a streak of PMIs from Canada and the US. A first round will come on Monday (manufacturing), and the second will be on Wednesday (services), along with the Beige Book <em>(which had been a no-show but is slowly getting interesting)</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But markets will have to wait for the real parade: Friday will release a retail sales and non-farm payrolls double-decker at 8:30 A.M. Retail sales sent an honest shocker last month, missing by 0.5 percentage points, while non-farm payrolls remained surprisingly strong. <em>Make sure to not miss our incoming previews.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, with a finally timely NFP, participants shall see if this boost in employment really proves to be solid or just a seasonal one (with new year employment).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after the latest ease in narrative, keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, particularly those involving the US-Iran talks, as they are likely to continue influencing commodity and broader markets.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next Week's High-Tier Economic Events</h3> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_Screenshot_2026-02-27_at_4.18.25PM.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1330\" data-height=\"1522\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_Screenshot_2026-02-27_at_4.18.25PM.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"For all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.

Still, stock markets are closing off of their session lows, supported by calmer month-end flows in the afternoon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US dollar is also surprisingly at the bottom of the FX board, a <em>victim of some heavy repositioning or month-end settling flows.</em>The CHF leading isn't very surprising, however.

It offers a low-cost option to investors seeking both dividend income and potential capital growth. The ETF focuses on the top 80 high-dividend-yielding companies within the S&amp;P 500 Index. SPYD can serve as a core fund for building a diversified portfolio across asset classes.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>SPYD is a medium-sized ETF, now with $7.6 billion in assets under management as of February 25, 2026. That’s up from just $6.5 billion at the time of my previous analysis. The </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/expenses\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>annual expense ratio</span></a><span> is low at only 7 basis points, while the trailing 12-month </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/dividends/scorecard\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>dividend yield</span></a><span> is high at 4.11%, about 2.9 percentage points above that of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/momentum/performance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>Share-price momentum</span></a><span> has improved markedly just in the last handful of months, now earning the product a B- ETF Grade in that category by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system (it was a D- back in November). From a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/risk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>risk perspective</span></a><span>, SPYD scores decently, but high exposure to cyclical and defensive sectors can bring about a unique set of risks, namely steep negative alpha when the Mag 7 take off. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For now, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/liquidity\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>liquidity</span></a><span> is quite strong. Average daily volume is north of 1.8 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is very tight at just two basis points, per State Street Funds.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For an update on the portfolio, the 2-star, Gold-rated ETF by Morningstar plots (not surprisingly) on the far-left side of the style box, indicating its weight toward the value style. There is no growth access, while more than 80% of the allocation is classified as SMID-cap by Morningstar. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While the fund is largely unexposed to some of today’s biggest AI risks (as seen in the software industry), macroeconomic factors play a large role in price action. Interest rates are particularly key. In general, the lower Treasury yields go, the more attractive high-yield equities become.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>On valuation, SPYD’s price-to-earnings ratio is very compelling at 13.7x, but the long-term earnings growth rate is also modest, near 6%. I would not be surprised to see EPS estimates get taken higher, as broader profit growth cascades across the so-called “real” economy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYD: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"804\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYD: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Zooming in on the sector breakdown, Real Estate is by far the largest stake.

Notice in the chart below that the fund is right near all-time highs. It scaled the November 2024 previous high-water mark after surging from November through the turn of this year. Now, with a rising long-term 200-day moving average, the bulls clearly control the primary trend. Price is above the 50 dma, which is higher than the 200 dma.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Also take a look at the volume by price profile on the left side of the graph. There should be major support if we see a pullback. For now, support is right near the current price, with a firmer layer between $45 and $45. I expect the current bull flag pattern to resolve higher, and it makes sense that the ETF is working off technical overbought conditions (as evidenced by the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>In terms of an upside target, a measured move objective to $67 is in play based on the depth of the Q4 2024 to April 2025 decline and subsequent breakout.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYD: Bullish Upside Breakout, Bull Flag, Rising 200dma</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYD: Bullish Upside Breakout, Bull Flag, Rising 200dma\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Stockcharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The Bottom Line</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I have a buy rating on SPYD.

The reasoning behind the risk-off flows was that US embassies in the Middle East had called for<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> their staff to prepare security measures over the weekend, leading to a spike in oil to $68 and a rough pre-open session.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dow Jones was leading indexes lower, dipping to -1.78% before rebounding. Benchmarks are now attempting to erase the entire overnight drop; however, this may prove difficult as traders prepare for a volatile session close, pulled on both sides by weekend risk and month-end flow volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rebound is strong, with recent Chicago PMI data (57.7 vs 52.8 exp) confirming that US data is far from weakening; quite the opposite, in fact. Produce prices have risen to 8-month highs amid elevated activity, further pressuring prices. This could prevent further rate cuts and hurt sentiment in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will prove challenging for risk sentiment, but looking at the immediate action, bulls and bears are just fighting within a range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's look at the technical situation by diving into today's session charts and key trading levels for the major US indices: the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Session's Stock Heatmap</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_Screenshot_2026-02-27_at_11.56.06AM.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"658\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_Screenshot_2026-02-27_at_11.56.06AM.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Current picture for the Stock Market (11:56 A.M.

The company reported strong progress on its synergy efforts less than one month following the close of its merger with Civitas Resources.</p> <p>The<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> market continues to underestimate the opportunity available through the SM improvement plan. SM is currently priced at a 14% free cash flow yield. This is before the company has had the opportunity to fully pursue synergy related cash flow improvements. This figure improves by several percentage points if the company is able to achieve the upper end of its synergy target.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a first step toward this goal, SM announced it was selling a gassier block of its Eagle Ford acreage for a sale price of $950 million. This asset sale presents a modest impact to overall production values but significantly improves the company's balance sheet and interest expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the combination of deleveraging and free cash flow improvements to lead to significant share price appreciation. I am establishing a price target of $35 per share by year end 2027. This supports an annualized 25% return plus dividends to support a Strong Buy recommendation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Release Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a standalone basis, SM executed well. The company generated $2.26B in full-year EBITDAX, valuing the base business at just 2.3 times full-year EBITDA. Additionally, the company paid down over $400 million in debt. In doing so, the company's leverage ratio was lowered to 1.05x, a very solid number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite these achievements, the focus of the year-end earnings conference call was on 2026 guidance and the details surrounding the go-forward plan following the merger with Civitas Resources. At a high level, this plan focuses on maximizing free cash flow at the expense of some volumes. This will allow the company the financial flexibility to start paying down the heavy debt burden that was absorbed from Civitas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726702154834.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More specifically, the company has slashed $450 million, or 14%, out of the 2025 CAPEX budget. The company will be dropping three rigs while focusing on oil-weighted locations. As a result, oil production is expected to climb modestly on a percentage basis. However, total production will be allowed to fall approximately 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This decline in total production is somewhat inflated due to the previously announced sale of the company's gassier Eagle Ford assets. Excluding this transaction, forward production would have only reduced by 8% at the planned investment rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"New Portfolio Activity\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/20589091-17721133076131155.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">New Portfolio Activity <span>(SM Investor Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SM also provided an outline for future free cash flow deployment in 2026.

The company also plans to continue to buy back shares, although this is expected to be the smallest aspect of the cash return framework.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The elephant in the room for this investment thesis is the company's goal to reduce debt. 80% of the free cash flow remaining after financing the dividend will be directed toward cleaning up the balance sheet. The size of this allocation corresponds directly to the scope of work that needs to be performed to complete repairs to the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720727714348602.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With nearly $8B in total debt following the merger, SM's debt load currently dwarfs its own market cap ($5B). A strong effort to correct this issue is likely to result in an expanding multiple for the company that trades at industry low levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the key benefits of the merger with Civitas is that it allows SM to be on better terms with its lenders. The company has recently received two upgrades from <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-upgrades-sm-energy-to-bb-off-rating-watch-positive-outlook-stable-30-01-2026#:~:text=Fitch%20Ratings%20%2D%20Chicago%20%2D%2030%20Jan,be%20assumed%20by%20SM%20Energy.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fitch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3511227#:~:text=The%20merger%20will%20expand%20the,its%201.0x%20leverage%20target.\" rel=\"nofollow\">S&amp;P Global</a>, putting the company closer to achieving an investment-grade rating. Clearing this financial hurdle unlocks the opportunity for SM to trade at a significantly higher earnings multiple.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Synergy Progress And Upside Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the onset of the merger, SM revealed a plan to generate $200-$300m in synergies. Roughly one month after the transaction closed, SM announced that action had been taken on $185 million of that target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the image below, we can see that G&amp;A expense, as well as interest savings, represents the bulk of the improvements achieved to date. This amounts to much of the low hanging fruit from any merger of equals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CIVI C-suite has effectively been dismantled, leading to an easy G&amp;A victory. Additionally, the company received a $950 million cash injection from divesting part of its Eagle Ford acreage. This debt can be used to tackle the inherited debt, some of which carries a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/31603253\">9.6% interest rate</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720726034331074.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operationally, the company has made initial strides in implementing efficiency improvements. However, it is far too early in the process to expect much progress in this area. As a result, only $60 million of the total $150 million opportunity set have embarked on any form of positive action.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the progress, the market appeared dissatisfied as the company's share price traded down 4% after the earnings release. However, the SM story is one of synergies and balance sheet recovery. Both of these objectives require time and patience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market appears to be missing the two key facts. The first fact is that SM's free cash flow is growing through synergies. The already announced $185 million improvement in free cash flow represents a 3.5% improvement in FCF. That number expands to 6% if the full $300 million is realized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second fact that is being missed is that 100% of that free cash flow is being allocated for the benefit of shareholders. Dividends and buybacks are obvious ways to pay back shareholders. However, the balance sheet recovery story is something that is often overlooked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most investors steer away from highly levered companies. On a pro forma basis, the company holds a leverage ratio of approximately 1.5-1.7x, making it higher than what the market considers ideal. However, since SM remains highly cash flow positive, this problem is fixable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In time, as SM repairs the balance sheet, leverage will be driven into the low 1.0 range per <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875442-sm-energy-company-sm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">management commentary</a>. These repairs allow SM to convert debt into shareholder equity and a higher share price. Further, as progress is achieved, the previously mentioned credit ratings can be improved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The simple act of paying down debt creates a flywheel effect. Interest expenses reduce, unlocking more free cash flow. Better leverage then leads to an investment-grade rating and a higher multiple for the company’s stock. Better credit ratings allow the company to refinance its most expensive debt, again unlocking more free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown below, SM trades at half the valuation level of its peers. Completing this process unlocks a significant re-rating that could allow the stock’s multiple to double over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_535df35d432636b14d3a016dc8a29905.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, this process is long and slow. It requires consistent focus from the company to change the minds of the investment community. The next section will discuss why I have high confidence that SM can tackle this challenge.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2026 operational plan for SM is to focus on value and not volumes. The company will allow total production activity to drop while focusing on higher oil concentration targets. As a result, the company's oil production has been guided to account for 54% of total volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the cost front, SM is guiding for a noticeable increase in lease operating expenses. This is likely derived from producing fewer barrels. The net result is a mid-single-digit increase in operating costs for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this is more than offset by the higher margins afforded by the higher oil cut. As a result, I now model SM to produce between $750 million and $850 million in 2026 FCF. This model was created using a $60/barrel and $2.55/MCF price deck, providing modest upside through the company's hedging portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SM Energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"SM Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/20589091-17720728626519804.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SM Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These hedges cover roughly half of SM's projected volumes at attractive prices in excess of this model. As a result, these hedges conservatively protect the company’s current 14% FCF yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By adding in the company’s efforts on value creation, this figure is easily expandable. The company’s base case improvement is expected to realize $200 million in free cash flow uplift. This clearly pushes the optimized version of the company into the 20% FCF yield territory.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent weeks, oil has enjoyed a resurgence on the back of renewed tensions between the US and Iran. This political premium is unlikely to last forever and thus exposes the energy sector to near-term headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this premium were to erode, the commodity would be forced to reconcile with an oversupplied market. While demand has remained resilient, supply is still dominating the market after OPEC+ fully ramped up production in mid-2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do not expect the commodity to break out of the $60/barrel range, thus limiting SM’s margins. Even though the company has solid hedges in place, the market is unlikely to overlook the near-term challenge should there be a price reversion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Key Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. SM Energy released its pro forma capital and production plans after the Civitas acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The company is targeting a significant CAPEX reduction as well as a higher concentration of oil production to improve margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. I project SM as generating 14% in its current form. Cash flow improvements through synergies and optimizations hold the potential to boost this figure to over 20% in the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. This strong free cash flow will be allocated to debt reduction. By reducing the debt, shareholders should expect a valuation re-rating as the company pushes to achieve an investment-grade credit rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. I hold a $35 price target due to this re-rating potential. This and the company’s 4% dividend yield are supportive of a Strong Buy recommendation.</p>",

Markets continued to rebound from post-“Liberation Day” lows as legal challenges, implementation delays, and immediate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> economic impacts remained muted. While tariffs and other policy outcomes are still pending, we should see some resolution from the Supreme Court in the coming months. However, financial markets remained confident in a solid economy, rangebound inflation, and early signs of easing geopolitical risks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. economic data continued to signal resilience despite a U.S. government shutdown that delayed or cancelled key releases. Once resolved, the post-shutdown data confirmed that certain trends remained intact: positive growth, contained inflation, and unemployment that held near historically low levels despite some downside surprises. This allowed the Federal Reserve (Fed) to resume easing, cutting rates by 25 basis points (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPS\" title=\"BPS Technology Public Company Limited\">BPS</a>) at both the October and December Federal Open Market Committee ('FOMC') meetings. The Fed has acknowledged that while elements of its mandate are in conflict, it has chosen to focus on protecting the labor market in the near term. Global monetary policy remains desynchronized, with divergences among the European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan. Geopolitical developments were mixed: volatility re-emerged in the Russia/Ukraine conflict, while the Middle East saw some signs of progress. China's military exercises late in the quarter around Taiwan were a reminder that tensions remain unresolved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing market rebound drove broadly positive financial performance for 4Q. Fixed income sectors posted gains as front-end interest rates declined, and most spread sectors outperformed U.S. Treasuries. The U.S. Treasury curve steepened, with the 2-year yield down by 13 bps, the 5-year yield down by 2 bps, the 10-year yield up by 2 bps, and the 30-year yield higher by 11 bps.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Performance Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund (Class I) returned 1.51% in the fourth quarter versus the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index return of 1.10%.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positive Contributors</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>U.S. Treasury Securities: The Fund's underweight to U.S. Treasuries had a positive impact as most spread sectors outperformed U.S. Treasuries and delivered excess returns.</li> <li>Emerging Markets ('EM') Sovereigns: Allocation and selection within EM sovereigns were positive.</li> <li>Investment Grade ('IG') Corporates: The Fund's underweight and selection were positive.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Detractors</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities ('RMBS'): Allocation to RMBS over agency mortgage-backed securities ('MBS') was negative.</li> <li>High Yield ('HY') Corporate Securities Selection: Selection versus the benchmark was negative.</li> <li>Asset-Backed Securities ('ABS') Selection: Selection versus the benchmark was negative.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Fund Strategy and Positioning</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Increased exposure to MBS, IG corporates, and cash.</li> <li>Reduced exposure to ABS, RMBS, and bank loans.</li> <li>In addition to changes to the Fund's sector allocation during the quarter, we continue to optimize positioning within sectors based on our view of the best relative value.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM Debt and Non-U.S. Exposure: The J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index ended 2025 on a strong note—its 3.29% return was supported by monetary easing, resilient technicals, and outperformance among select countries. High yield ('HY') credits led performance, while IG lagged amid modest spread volatility. Spreads tightened by 31 bps in 4Q to close the year at 253 bps. The J.P. Morgan CEMBI Global Diversified underperformed the J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified, returning 1.29% amid significant volatility in Brazilian corporates during October. Local markets returned 3.34%, aided by a softer U.S. dollar and improving inflation. The Fund's overall EM exposure was marginally lower in 4Q. The Fund maintained a preference for U.S. dollar assets and EM HY over EM IG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IG Corporates: IG corporate spreads widened 4 bps in 4Q to end 2025 in the high 70s, still at the very low end of the 20-year range. Yields were little changed at 4.81%. Supply was the big story as nearly $100 billion in issuance from large cloud providers set a new 4Q record. This caused some market indigestion even as demand drivers remained in place and flows stayed positive throughout the quarter. Credit metrics were stable while ratings drifted higher. BBBs are at their lowest percentage of the overall market in a decade. With valuations tight, we favor a defensive posture, with a preference for U.S. banks, utilities, and capital goods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HY Corporates: The Bloomberg High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Bond Index gained 1.31% in 4Q. Credit spreads were little changed, with the Index ending 1 bp tighter at 266 bps. The market continues to focus on inflation and its impact on rates, the outlook for artificial intelligence and related spending, and consumer spending. Finance companies, metals &amp; mining, and gaming outperformed during the quarter. Cyclical industries such as packaging, retailers, and buildings products lagged as lower-quality names declined sharply into year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Securitized: The securitized markets posted positive total and excess returns in 4Q, outperforming other credit sectors. Spreads tightened despite elevated issuance across all securitized sub-sectors as investors sought additional income and spread. Our exposure to agency MBS outperformed IG corporates as strong technicals, the Fed rate cut, and low rate volatility rewarded investors. While our securitized strategy continues to focus on up-in-quality credits such as agency MBS, we're also selectively exploring transactions that present promising yield opportunities lower in the capital stack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4Q <span>25 </span> Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermediate Bond Fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NAMFX\" title=\"Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermdt Bond Fund A\">NAMFX</a></span>) </h3> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1708\" data-height=\"759\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"4Q 25 Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermediate Bond Fund DATA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"284\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17722498947820003_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p></p> <p>Performance data quoted represents past performance.

The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt instruments may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer-term maturities. High Yield Fixed Income Securities (Junk Bonds): There is a greater risk of issuer default, less liquidity, and increased price volatility related to high yield securities than investment grade securities. Bank Loans: Bank loans may be unsecured or not fully collateralized, may be subject to restrictions on resale, may be less liquid and may trade infrequently on the secondary market. Bank loans settle on a delayed basis; thus, sale proceeds may not be available to meet redemptions for a substantial period of time after the sale of the loan. Foreign &amp; Emerging Markets: Investing in foreign securities, especially in emerging markets, subjects the portfolio to additional risks such as increased volatility, currency fluctuations, less liquidity, and political, regulatory, economic, and market risk. ABS/MBS: Changes in interest rates can cause both extension and prepayment risks for asset- and mortgage-backed securities. These securities are also subject to risks associated with the non-repayment of underlying collateral, including losses to the portfolio. Market Volatility: The value of the securities in the portfolio may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies and/or general economic conditions. Local, regional, or global events such as war or military conflict, terrorism, pandemic, or recession could impact the portfolio, including hampering the ability of the portfolio's manager(s) to invest its assets as intended. Underlying Portfolio Data: Portfolio data shown includes indirect exposure through investments in other funds (if any) to the extent available and appropriate.

We're going to be looking at the fund itself, how it's built and for what purpose, and all that great stuff, but I think what's even more important is why the fund is behaving the way it is, and whether that's sustainable for the long haul. Let's get started.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The FRDM Fund for Top EM Equities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just so you know <a href=\"https://freedometfs.com/frdm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">where the fund's coming from</a>, the \"freedom\" part refers to the portfolio strategy of weighting the equities using \"personal and economic freedom metrics\" as the basis for inclusion and allocation. Lady Liberty herself graces the ETF's webpage, and the fund seems to have distilled the level of protection provided to personal and economic freedom across 24 target EM countries and 87 individual metrics into a completely automated algorithm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This \"freedom-weighting\" is then applied to rank the top ten companies in each of these EM countries, after which a market-cap weighting is applied on top. The result is a portfolio of about 120 equities ranked by their freedom weights and market caps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Life + Liberty Index acts as the benchmark, so this is a simple index fund but with specific criteria being used to compile the index and FRDM's portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has an AUM of $2.97 billion as of February 26, with an expense ratio of 0.49%, or about average for the ETF universe. I'd have thought an automated portfolio that's little more than a fancy index fund would have much lower expenses, but that's not the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has been around since May 2019, so there's plenty of data to work with in terms of how it's performed on a long-term horizon, give or take.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The country exposure figures are pretty interesting, but I'd like to explore the fund's core philosophies of \"freedom-weighting\", capturing freedom metrics at the country level, and a default exclusion of state-owned corporations (must be less than 20% state-owned to qualify for inclusion). These three philosophies seem to feed into the belief that \"freedom makes better market\", so let's look at some of the quant elements that comprise</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1385\" data-height=\"782\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FRDM Website\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772174694163133_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FRDM Website</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the fund's underlying investment principle seems to be that the freer the market, the more efficiently capital and labor can be deployed, the more sustainable the growth, and the quicker the bouncebacks from economic downturns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Has This Investment Philosophy Translated to Performance?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw how the fund has performed on a YTD basis, but what about since inception? Since we have nearly 7 years of data, its price and total returns for the since-inception period are pretty meaningful. Let's see what's what.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1217\" data-height=\"263\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"138\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721755634237533_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRDM clearly outperformed the market on all timelines, even when the U.S. market was flat, and that's what we've been seeing over the past couple of months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Things look good historically, but that only means the fund has done its job of beating the market so far. What about in the future, which is our real goal here? To get to that, we'll need to check some of the top equities and see how they've been doing and whether or not their stocks still have steam to go higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assessing the Top Equities of FRDM</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>), and SK hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>), the top three make up a little less than one-fourth of the portfolio, or about 24%, so looking at their performances in the last reported period and the outlook for the next should give us a pretty good view of where FRDM is headed in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung reported <a href=\"https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/global/ir/docs/2025_4Q_conference_eng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings for Q4</a> and FY-25 in January, and it looks pretty good. Quarterly revenues and operating profits grew by an impressive 24%, while for the full year, revenues were up by 11%, EBITDA margin was up 2% to 26%, net margin grew to 14 basis points from 11 bps, and ROE was also up 2%, all on a YoY basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business as usual, nothing to worry about here, but the biggest growth engine right now is Device Solutions, under which the Memory segment is reported. That's where we have the strongest evidence of growth, and we're going to see that with SK hynix as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for Memory is also very positive, with growth still on the table for Q1-26 as well as FY-26. The Foundry business is expected to see a seasonal decline in Q1-26 (sequential basis), but the full-year expectation is that advanced nodes are going to drive double-digit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The seasonality theme seems to persist across other business segments like SDC (Samsung Display Corp.), where smartphone seasonal demand is expected to decline sequentially, and we could see some margin pressure from high-cost memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other than the key issue of memory availability and pricing pressure, I don't see anything that points to a poor FY-26, so that's great for the ETF because it invests in the KRX listing (Korean Exchange), not the ADR. Trading volumes for the ADR are also pretty low, so if you're thinking of investing in this company, the Korean listing is likely the better option. If your brokerage doesn't provide that access, the FRDM ETF is the next best thing because it's able to capture capital appreciation pretty effectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker also reported earnings in January, and the stock is already up over 13%. RSI isn't helping, and oscillators are indicating a neutral to bearish outlook, but <a href=\"https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-TSM/technicals/\" rel=\"noopener\">key MAs</a> show positive trends signaling a Buy, which is good for FRDM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1695\" data-height=\"491\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"185\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-1772179907402624_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1805\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TradingView\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721800482417772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a fundamentals standpoint, TSMC is rock-solid, with a forward revenue growth expectation of 30% against a 10% median figure, and an even better 35% GAAP EPS outlook. The best part is a lack of correlation to the broad U.S. market. You'd expect that because of the EM-only portfolio, but for the purpose of our FRDM analysis, that's a good sign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1228\" data-height=\"275\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"143\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721803633751194_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for SK hynix, the parent stock on the KRX is up 32% in the last month on the back of a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4543360-sk-hynixs-profit-surges-on-ai-memory-demand-to-form-ai-firm-in-us\">66% revenue bump</a> in Q4, YoY.

This stock's got a ways to go, so no running out of steam in the near future for sure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freedom Works, But Only Outside the U.S.!</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's ironic that an EM-based freedom ETF would do much better than equities in the 'free-est' market of all, the U.S., but that's the current reality. FRDM has lots of room to appreciate, and it adds a nice layer of icing with the 1.8% yield. Not a lot, but that's mainly because of the underlying NAV appreciation more than anything.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1194\" data-height=\"554\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59285166-17721811704891434_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peak yield was around 5% at the end of 2023, and the dividend payouts are still a little lumpy, but it does add a thin layer of downside protection for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'd rate FRDM a Buy based on this analysis, and my higher-level view is that EMs have a lot to offer that the U.S. market doesn't right now, so this is a good time to take advantage of the growth differentials between EMs and developed markets.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, it's companies like TSMC and hynix that are actually driving growth in U.S. markets, simply because of the fact that all the fastest-growing AI companies are buying products from them that nobody else is making at that scale and that level of advancement. Easy Buy for FRDM even if you only consider that one critical aspect.</p>",

The AI trade continues to dominate large-cap investors' focus, but we are beginning to see some signs of broadening outside of the Magnificent 7 stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. As the infrastructure buildout continues, we expect investors to be more discerning around capital expenditures and the timing of returns on those investments. We expect companies with flexible balance sheets and sustainable free cash flow to be the long-term winners as we move into phase two and three of the AI revolution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Russell 1000 Value Index was the best performing of the nine Russell style boxes, returning 3.81% for the quarter. Within the index, the IT (+11%), communication services (+8%), and health care (+8%) sectors were the best performing in the quarter. Meanwhile, the interest-rate-sensitive real estate (-2%) and utilities (-1%) sectors were the worst performing within the index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund underperformed its benchmark for the quarter as the market's narrow thematic focus created some headwinds for our process, which focuses on companies with competitively advantaged asset bases, sustainable free cash flow, and flexible balance sheets. We have seen this in the early innings of past rotations and technological advancements, and we believe our fund is well positioned to benefit as investors begin to focus on the next stage of the infrastructure buildout and market cycle.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund performance and attribution</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Contributors and Detractors to Quarter-end Fund Performance</h4> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors</h4> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>• General Motors Co.

The largest contributor within communication services was Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, which provides the dominant search advertising platform, Android smartphone software, YouTube, and the Google Cloud platform including Gemini AI. Shares outperformed the benchmark in the quarter, supported by resilient core advertising trends and growing investor confidence in its AI monetization road map. Search, YouTube, and Cloud revenue growth accelerated again, reinforcing the narrative that Gemini integration is beginning to yield tangible returns on investment. While capital expenditure guidance remains elevated, visible returns in Cloud and AI Overview monetization provide comfort. We continue to view Alphabet as a core AI infrastructure beneficiary with underappreciated leverage to enterprise and consumer AI adoption, a pristine balance sheet, and an attractive valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another large contributor within the quarter was General Motors Co. ('GM'), a leading U.S. automaker with iconic brands including Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac. GM continues to demonstrate operational excellence through disciplined execution in pricing, inventory management, and production, while successfully navigating tariff challenges and the transition to electric vehicles. The company recently raised full-year guidance on the back of favorable pricing trends and effective tariff mitigation, and management signaled that 2026 is expected to outperform 2025 across multiple key metrics. GM's competitive advantage stems from its scale, brand strength, and ability to leverage advanced manufacturing and technology investments to drive efficiency and innovation. A strong balance sheet provides ample flexibility for strategic capital deployment, notably toward shareholder returns and targeted growth initiatives. GM continues to execute through industry transitions better than competitors, differentiating itself through disciplined capital deployment and operational excellence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock selection in the IT and health care sectors detracted the most from relative performance. Within health care, the largest detractor was Labcorp Holdings Inc., a clinical laboratory that enables patient testing to better inform health care providers on individual patient care. The company is also the market leader in central labs, recruiting participants and providing insights at scale for clinical trials in the drug development process. The services provided by Labcorp across its two business segments are critical functions in the health care system that ultimately lead to better patient outcomes. Labcorp's scale, geographical reach, and streamlined operations, including investment in automation across its footprint, set the company apart. The lab business is especially fragmented, and management has a unique opportunity to continue rolling up smaller labs to gain scale. With ample deployment capacity to execute on share buybacks and bolt-on deals, the cash stream is set to grow meaningfully in the coming years. After performing nicely for the year through the end of October, the shares consolidated gains in the final stretch of 2025. We view this as a healthy short-term reset and continue to have confidence in the Labcorp story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global leader in snacking with dominant positions in biscuits, chocolate, and candy, Mondelēz International, Inc., detracted from performance this quarter. Gross margins contracted meaningfully due to elevated cocoa costs and softness in parts of its portfolio. Despite near-term margin pressure and a slowing consumer, Mondelēz maintains a durable competitive advantage through its iconic brands, global scale, and pricing power. Strong free cash flow supports growth-enhancing capital deployment. We believe the market is overly discounting Mondelēz's ability to navigate input cost headwinds and a sluggish consumer. With a proven track record of balancing pricing and volume, and a resilient cash flow profile, Mondelēz remains well positioned to deliver long-term value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund positioning and outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund made minor changes to positioning during the three-month period. The fund increased its weight in the IT and materials sectors while reducing its weight in the real estate and financials sectors as reward/risk ratios dictated. The fund's largest overweights versus its benchmark remained consumer discretionary and health care. The largest underweights continued to be communication services and financials. These weights were driven by our bottom-up reward/risk process as well as our portfolio construction methodology that is designed to isolate active risk to security selection as much as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. economy remains in decent shape and should be supported by the fiscal stimulus embedded in the latest reconciliation bill passed this summer. However, the current cycle is not without risks as investors monitor the weakening labor market. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve has the capacity and the resolve to react accordingly if unemployment rises. As that risk is realized, credit spreads will likely widen, lower beta stocks should lead, and companies with strong balance sheet positions should become more highly valued than they are today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the start of COVID, the market has followed the oscillations of fiscal, monetary, and geopolitical changes by rapidly flipping from risk-on to risk-off behavior. What has been lost is the \"normal\" middle that traditionally makes up the longest part of the market and economic cycle. We believe that \"normal\" is simply a matter of knowing the direction of travel (fiscal and monetary) and the rules of the game (political and regulatory). With these questions being largely answered as we wrap up 2025, we expect \"normal\" is around the corner and the merits of owning competitively advantaged businesses that produce strong and growing free cash flow will become in vogue and the beta-chasing phase of this cycle will be behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first leg of the AI revolution has been focused on the neoclouds/graphics processing units/semis/memory and large-cap growth, but similar to past \"revolutionary\" advancements, the capital spending around the infrastructure buildup will benefit many other companies and industries, many of these fall within the value universes. The 2000-2010 decade saw a handoff from the more speculative growth companies to more value-oriented companies as the internet buildup evolved. We expect that investors will become more discerning and demand a return on invested capital from companies. Active management will be essential to determine who the winners and losers will be in this \"sorting phase.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We expect the traditional cycle dynamics to continue as we move past phase one of the recovery and into phase two, which is characterized with a return to quality factors.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.</li> <li>Calculated based on a one-year period.</li> <li>Calculated for the Institutional Class based on a three-year period.

to change and may have changed since the date specified. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security.</p> <p>Benchmark Descriptions:</p> <p>The Lipper averages are compiled by Lipper, Inc., an independent mutual fund research and rating service. Each Lipper average represents a universe of funds that are similar in investment objective. You cannot invest directly in a Lipper average.</p> <p>The Morningstar Category average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group. The total return of the Morningstar Category average does not include the effect of sales charges. You cannot invest directly in a Morningstar Category average.</p> <p>The Russell 1000® Value Index measures the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with lower price/book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. You cannot invest directly in an index.</p> <p>The Russell 1000® Index measures the performance of the 1,000 largest companies in the Russell 3000® Index, which represents approximately 92% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000 Index. You cannot invest directly in an index.</p> <p>Diversification does not ensure or guarantee better performance and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses.</p> <p>Attribution Analysis:</p> <p>Performance attribution and sector returns are calculated using the Brinson-Fachler attribution model. As such, performance attribution calculations may differ from the fund's actual investment results. Common sources of attribution dispersion from official returns include: the use of end of day holdings and prices, the exclusion of fees, and the use of myriad pricing sources to accommodate different benchmark providers.</p> <p>Definition of Terms:</p> <p>Alpha measures the difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of risk (as measured by beta).</p> <p>Beta measures fund volatility relative to general market movements. It is a standardized measure of systematic risk in comparison with a specified index. The benchmark beta is 1.00 by definition.</p> <p>Downside capture measures a fund's replication of its benchmark during periods of negative returns. During periods of negative benchmark returns, a downside capture ratio less than 100% reflects product performance greater than the benchmark and a downside capture ratio greater than 100% reflects performance less than the benchmark.</p> <p>Information ratio measures the consistency of excess return (return in excess of a benchmark). This value is determined by taking the annualized excess return over a benchmark (style benchmark by default) and dividing it by the standard deviation of excess return.</p> <p>R-squared is a measurement of how similar a fund's historical performance has been to that of the benchmark. The measure ranges from 0.0, which means that the fund's performance bears no relationship to the performance of the index, to 1.0, which means that the fund's performance was perfectly synchronized with the performance of the benchmark.</p> <p>Sharpe ratio measures the potential reward offered by a mutual fund relative to its risk level. The ratio uses a fund's standard deviation and its excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the fund's historical risk-adjusted performance.</p> <p>Standard deviation represents the degree to which an investment's performance has varied from its average performance over a particular time period.</p> <p>Tracking error measures the extent to which a manager's performance mimics that of a benchmark. The value is the standard deviation of the difference between a fund's performance and a benchmark's performance.</p> <p>Upside capture measures a fund's replication of its benchmark during periods of positive returns. During periods of positive benchmark returns, an upside capture ratio greater than 100% reflects product performance greater than the benchmark and an upside capture ratio less than 100% reflects performance less than the benchmark.</p> <p>Barra Factors is a multi-factor model, created by Barra Inc., that measures the overall risk associated with a security, relative to the market. Barra Risk Factor Analysis incorporates over 40 data metrics, including earnings growth, share turnover, and senior debt rating.</p> <p>Risks: Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Stock values fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Consult the fund's prospectus for additional information on these and other risks.</p> <p>The Morningstar Rating for funds, or star rating, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.</p> <p>Across U.S.-domiciled large value funds, the Special Large Cap Value Fund received 4 stars among 1,059 funds, 4 stars among 995 funds, and 4 stars among 832 funds for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively. The Morningstar Rating is for the Institutional Class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.</p> <p>The Morningstar absolute ranking is based on the fund's total return rank relative to all funds that have the same category for the same time period. Morningstar rankings do not include the effect of sales charges. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</p> <p>© 2026 Morningstar. All rights reserved.

Notable absolute performance detractors were Chenier Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNG\" title=\"Cheniere Energy, Inc.\">LNG</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), AT&amp;T (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Vistra Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VST\" title=\"Vistra Corp.\">VST</a>).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning &amp; Outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>U.S. equity markets capped a strong year of performance with modest gains in the fourth quarter. Resurging concerns about the durability of artificial intelligence ('AI') development and the enormous levels of investment spent on AI infrastructure led to volatility during the last three months of the year. Despite these fears, and associated valuation worries, the Federal Reserve's easing monetary policy, moderating but still positive economic growth, and the ongoing penetration of AI buoyed the markets as the year ended.</li> <li>The S&amp;P 500 Index advanced by 2.6% for the quarter and, after a long stretch of outperformance by growth and large cap equities, market participation broadened out during the period. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the Index due to continued concentrated strength in mega-cap tech and AI beneficiaries. However, modest cooling in AI-led growth leadership and a rotation away from highly concentrated, premium valuation growth toward discounted cyclical and defensive sectors led to the outperformance of value stocks. Expectations of a lower interest rate environment helped support cyclicals as well as small caps during the quarter.</li> <li>Trepidation around valuations left no cushion for missing earnings expectations, and even companies that met expectations, but didn't exceed them, saw their share prices decline. Most sectors lagged the modest market return, with only healthcare and communications services outperforming. The healthcare sector led the market in the fourth quarter as the group rebounded after being under intermittent pressure since late 2024. Relief on the political front, solid earnings, innovation, notable strength in obesity/diabetes franchises, as well as discounted valuations, supported its performance. While communications services and technology drove market performance for the year, technology underperformed in the fourth quarter while communications services continued its outperformance, driven by media Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A) and continued strength in mega cap interactive media/internet names.</li> <li>Relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index sector weightings, the Fund is overweight industrials, utilities, energy, financials, and consumer staples. The Fund has a significant underweight to information technology and is also notably underweight communication services and consumer discretionary with smaller underweights to health care, real estate, and materials. The Fund's exposure to other sectors is broadly in line with the Index.</li> <li>The Fund remains balanced as we have kept turnover at a minimum. We believe that the underlying demand drivers of the economy is largely AI investment related, and our Fund has been positioned to take advantage of this in a low-risk manner (below market beta). One area that we are watching is the volatility of the AI capital expenditure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPEX\" title=\"Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.0\">CAPEX</a>) benefits that has picked up in the fourth quarter, which we are closely monitoring. While we believe that we are in the early innings of AI investment cycle, our experience has taught us that we need to be vigilant for any pivot as technology evolves with lightning speed.</li> <li> Earnings and dividend growth rates slowed in 2025 from their 2024 rates, and we don't anticipate a meaningful pickup in 2026. There are plenty of headwinds (elevated prices, robust valuation, unstable geopolitical and economic outlook) but we think there are enough productivity offsets that U.S. is likely to be able to pull forward. We remain disciplined in looking for attractive fundamentals with favorable risk-reward ratios while minimizing our downside risk. But most importantly, our focus is on individual company fundamentals. This is something that our investment framework prioritizes above anything else.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p></p> <p></p> <p>BARRON'S Best Fund Families 2025</p> <p>Barron's Best Fund Families: Ranked #4 for best fund family over the 1-year period ended 12/31/2024, among 48 qualifying fund families based on asset-weighted returns.</p> <p>Barron's: PGIM Investments ranked 4 out of 48, 8 out of 47, 12 out of 46 firms for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 12/31/2024, respectively.

Large-capitalization companies go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions; the Fund's value may not rise or fall as much as the value of funds that emphasize companies with smaller market capitalizations. Small- and Mid-cap investments may be subject to more erratic market movements than large-cap stocks. There is no guarantee that companies paying dividends will continue to do so in the future, or that dividend distributions will increase over time. The Fund's performance during a broad market advance could suffer because dividend paying stocks may not experience the same capital appreciation as non-dividend paying stocks. Foreign securities are subject to currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. There is no guarantee the Fund's objective will be achieved.

Source: Barron's, Feb. 27, 2025. Barron's rankings are based on asset-weighted returns in funds in five categories: U.S. Equity; World Equity; Mixed Asset; Taxable Bond; and Tax-Exempt (each a \"Barron's ranking category\"). Rankings also take into account an individual fund's performance within its Lipper peer universe. Lipper calculated each fund's net total return for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, minus the effects of 12b-1 fees and sales charges. Each fund in the survey was given a percentile ranking, with 100 the highest and 1 the lowest in its category. That ranking measured how a fund compared with its peer \"universe,\" as tracked by Lipper, not just the funds in the survey. Individual fund scores were then multiplied by the 2024 weighting of their Barron's ranking category as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. Those fund scores were then totaled, creating an overall score and ranking for each fund family in the survey in each Barron's ranking category. To qualify for the ranking, firms must offer at least three active mutual funds or actively run ETFs in Lipper's general U.S. Stock category; one in World Equity; and one Mixed Asset. They also need to offer at least two taxable bond funds and one national tax-exempt bond fund. All funds must have a track record of at least one year.</p> <p>Consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing.

Common Units\">BSM</a></span>) is expecting its production to ramp up during 2026 after falling to around 32,100 BOEPD in Q4 2025. It expects an average of <a href=\"https://investor.blackstoneminerals.com/news-events/press-releases/news-details/2026/Black-Stone-Minerals-L-P--Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Provides-Guidance-for-2026/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">roughly 34,500 BOEPD</a> in 2026 production (roughly<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the same as 2025), and that points to double-digit production growth from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone has most of its 2026 production hedged, so changes in commodity prices should have little direct impact on its distributable cash flow. I expect it to maintain a $0.30 per unit quarterly distribution during 2026, although <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874020-black-stone-minerals-l-p-common-units-bsm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">spending on seismic data acquisitions</a> and mineral and royalty acquisitions will likely result in its leverage and net debt increasing during the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am slightly trimming my estimate of Black Stone's value <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854573-black-stone-minerals-quarterly-distribution-likely-to-remain-at-0-30-per-unit-during-2026\">from $16 per unit</a> to $15.50 per unit due to lower near-term production expectations and the projected increase in its net debt and leverage in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 2025 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone ended up with approximately 32,100 BOEPD (74% natural gas) in Q4 2025 production, bringing its full-year production to approximately 34,600 BOEPD (74% natural gas).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This production was towards the high end of its revised (in Q2 2025) full-year production guidance of 33,000 to 35,000 BOEPD, although well below its initial guidance of 38,000 to 41,000 BOEPD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone had revised its guidance downward due to lower-than-expected first-half production plus expectations for delayed natural gas production growth during the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone's distribution coverage for Q4 2025 was 1.05x with its $0.30 per unit distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone's production fell by 11.5% quarter-over-quarter, which was a bit more than I expected, contributing to its distribution coverage being lower than my 1.1x projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It expects its production to ramp up from Q4 2025 levels throughout 2026, with \"solid growth\" from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone expects roughly 33,000 to 36,000 BOEPD in 2026 production (with a guidance midpoint of 34,500 BOEPD and with 77% of that production being natural gas). It indicates that approximately 97% of that production would be mineral and royalty production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone thus expects roughly flat year-over-year total production growth in 2026, but with an approximately 11% decline in oil production and a 3% increase in natural gas production. As noted above, though, Black Stone should see total production growth from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026 (likely double-digit growth).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I project Black Stone to generate $415 million in 2026 revenues after hedges at current strip prices of $65 WTI oil and $3.80 NYMEX natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone has around 85% of its 2026 oil production (based on guidance midpoint) hedged at an average of $64.39 and approximately 88% of its 2026 natural gas production hedged at $3.73.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that Black Stone's 2026 distributable cash flow is barely affected by changes in oil and gas prices (independent of the effect on production).</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Type</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Barrels/Mcf</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Realized $ Per Barrel/Mcf</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Revenue ($ Million)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Oil (Barrels)</p></td> <td><p>2,896,275</p></td> <td><p>$64.00</p></td> <td><p>$185</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Natural Gas [MCF]</p></td> <td><p>58,177,350</p></td> <td><p>$3.80</p></td> <td><p>$221</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Lease Bonus and Other Income</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>$14</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Hedge Value</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>-$5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>$415</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone is thus projected to generate $271 million in distributable cash flow, or approximately $1.28 per unit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone's distribution coverage is projected at 1.06x, assuming that it keeps its quarterly distribution at $0.30 per unit (which I believe is likely for 2026).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that Black Stone is now excluding seismic data acquisition costs from its definitions of adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. These costs may add up to close to $30 million in 2026, as it plans to finish up various Shelby Trough seismic projects by early 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone would have approximately $255 million in 2026 distributions with a $0.30 per unit quarterly distribution, leaving $16 million to cover seismic data acquisitions and mineral and royalty acquisitions before its net debt increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, Black Stone is likely to see some increase in its net debt during 2026. It had $154 million in outstanding credit facility borrowings at the end of 2025, while its credit facility has a $580 million borrowing base and $375 million in elected commitments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone made approximately $115 million in mineral and royalty interest acquisitions in 2025. If it makes $100 million in mineral and royalty interest acquisitions in 2026, it would finish the year with approximately $265 million in net debt in this scenario.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>$ Million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Lease Operating Expense</p></td> <td><p>$8</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Production Costs And Ad Valorem Taxes</p></td> <td><p>$41</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash G&amp;A</p></td> <td><p>$51</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Interest Expense</p></td> <td><p>$15</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Preferred Distributions</p></td> <td><p>$29</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Expenses</p></td> <td><p>$144</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notes On Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I previously estimated Black Stone's value at $16 per unit. I am revising that slightly downward to $15.50 per unit at long-term (after 2026) $70 WTI oil and $3.75 NYMEX natural gas. This reduction is partly due to Black Stone's Q4 2025 production and 2026 production guidance being a bit lower than I expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone is in a bit of a transition period, and I expect its production to increase significantly in upcoming years due to its various development agreements. I continue to assume that Black Stone's production will get to 50,000+ BOEPD by 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Black Stone's near-term risk has gone up a bit due to the expected cash burn in 2026 while its production ramps up. Black Stone's leverage would be 0.8x at the end of 2026 if it spent $100 million on mineral and royalty interest acquisitions (that are mostly non-producing currently). Black Stone's leverage isn't excessive yet, but it should attempt to reduce its net debt after 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Stone Minerals is aiming for 50,000+ BOEPD in production by 2030, and 2026 is a rebuilding year in that sense. Black Stone's production fell to 32,100 BOEPD in Q4 2025, but it anticipates production ramping up through 2026 (probably with double-digit production growth from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect Black Stone to have slightly over 1.0x distribution coverage in 2026 with a $0.30 per unit quarterly distribution. Black Stone's net debt could increase to over $250 million (from a bit over $150 million currently) due to acquisition spending on seismic data and mineral and royalty interests.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have adjusted my estimate of Black Stone's value down slightly from $16 to $15.50 per unit and am now neutral on it at its current price of slightly over $15 per unit.</p>",
