However, this doesn’t mean the past will keep repeating itself, creating an opportunity for some sector stocks to rotate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where Privia Health Group, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRVA\" title=\"Privia Health Group, Inc.\">PRVA</a></span>) comes into play: a fee-for-service physician enablement company with sufficient growth to warrant the premiums assigned to it. With a steady stream of recurring revenue and a moat around its relationships with various medical practices, this stock combines the safety of healthcare with a high-growth profile, which should be priced into its valuation over the coming months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With implemented providers being a key driver in Privia Health's business platform, further growth in users can deliver on both revenue growth and economies of scale to spread costs as a boost to operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As will be pointed out, an expansion in the company's footprint in the United States market will carry out these positive effects moving forward, creating upside potential not yet priced into the stock today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Right now, the stock trades at a triple top, as the chart suggests. However, chances are $26.00 will mark a breakout ahead of its following quarterly earnings results, to be announced on November 6th, 2025. While a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model doesn’t reflect much upside under conservative assumptions, recent developments may warrant a revision and a more favorable exit case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Recent Events Create High Expectations For Privia Health's Quarter</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A September 23rd, 2025, press release points to <a href=\"https://ir.priviahealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/privia-health-expands-value-based-care-footprint-acquisition\" rel=\"nofollow\">Privia Health’s acquisition</a> of Accountable Care Organization (ACO) from Evolent Health Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVH\" title=\"Evolent Health, Inc.\">EVH</a>). This addition to the portfolio allows Privia Health to tap into over 120,000 new users, expanding this revenue stream and post-acquisition growth trajectories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the financial effects will be clearer on the upcoming earnings call, though market expectations are high. With a forward P/E ratio of 78.8x today, above all the mentioned comparables (discussed later), Privia Health’s earnings per share (EPS) growth is likely to beat the current consensus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1402\" data-height=\"692\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Historical and forecasted income statement figures\" width=\"640\" height=\"316\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Privia Health income statement <span>(TIKR.com )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given sustained conservative revenue growth into FY’27, appropriate margins, and tax assumptions, it is still somewhat unclear where analysts are getting the $1.17 EPS figure for their forecast. Under the current model, a base-case scenario suggests Privia Health can generate $0.36 in EPS, well below the current Wall Street consensus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This delta implies a special item could be in the works for the income statement, likely stemming from the Evolent Health acquisition or other unexpected developments to be announced in the upcoming earnings release. When it comes to these exogenous factors, it is clear that the delta in EPS forecasts will come from the accretive effects of the Evolent acquisition, which are broken down below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1192\" data-height=\"595\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF valuation model for $PRVA stock\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-1761414457542037_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Privia Health Discounted Cash Flow Model <span>(TIKR.com, self-made Excel)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carrying these assumptions into a DCF model, the stock’s fair value points to being closer to $17.43 per share for a net downside from today’s price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with an EV/EBITDA exit assumption of 39.0x, in line with historical ranges for Privia Health, this does not meet a positive outcome under today’s assumptions, so that a potential investment will rely on updated guidance and financial figures from this recent acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To come up with this valuation under a DCF model, assumptions under Wall Street consensus have been made:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">- Revenue Growth: 15% FY'25, 9.6% FY'26, and 12% for FY'27 with a straight line assumption into FY'28 and FY'29.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These assumptions are in line with the Wall Street consensus up to FY'27, then using a straight line into FY'28 and FY'29.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">- Gross Margins: 10% from FY'25 through FY'27 with a bump to 10.2% into FY'28 and FY'29.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Gross margin assumptions, a three-year average of previous operations has been used, with a lean toward expansion to 10.2%, driven by economies of scale that help spread platform costs across more customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">** These still deliver EPS figures that fall below Wall Street consensus, keeping operating items well in line with historical norms, amplifying the belief that an earnings jump is likely to come from exogenous factors and events **</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More than these accretive effects, investors can look to what is happening in the healthcare space in general to find additional boosts in growth for Privia Health.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As President Trump calls to implement cuts to Medicaid benefits, on which <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/13/nx-s1-5463762/can-able-bodied-adults-on-medicaid-replace-farm-workers-amid-immigration-crackdown#:~:text=Rollins%20has%20also%20said%20that%20there%20are,medically%20frail%20or%20have%20other%20disabling%20conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">roughly 34.1 million</a> able-bodied adults rely, a reasonable expectation is that these care providers will look to limit their medical loss ratios and seek value-based care (VBC) instead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where Privia Health comes into play, now amplifying its reach with ACO under its umbrella. Assuming a 10% conversion from broad care into VBC (or 3.4 million people), the additional revenue on top of the ACO projected benefits can make this $17.43 DCF valuation seem conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this 10% conversion rate from broad care into VBC, some assumptions can be made using the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">2025 Medicaid trustees payout data</a> reported:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">- $9,400 average spent per year per user.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">- Under normal Privia Health platform fees of 1.3%, this shift into VBC could represent (1.3% * $9,400) = $120/yr in revenue per user.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keeping this in line with the 3.4 million new users coming into VBC after these Medicaid cuts, investors can arrive at $120/yr in revenue per user * 3.4 million users for a net revenue addition of $408 million on a base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is how that valuation range changes as these assumptions are added to forecasts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Privia Health's Premium Comes From The Revenue Side</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Spreading Privia Health next to comparables in the space, such as Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc.

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCS\" title=\"Doximity, Inc.\">DOCS</a>), will provide realistic valuation benchmarks for Privia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This peer selection is driven by a mix of subscription and service revenue exposure.

Under the Wall Street consensus for revenue in FY’25 of $2.1 billion, and a P/S multiple range of 2.25x to 2.66x, Privia should be able to trade up to $36.32 and $43.15 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking back at the<span> </span><a href=\"https://ir.priviahealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/privia-health-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s 2Q’25 results</a>, a 23.4% annual revenue growth rate places it among the ranks of Hims &amp; Hers and other fast-growing companies in the space.

Additionally, with over 120,000 new customers and expansion into 11 additional states, the gross margin (and operating margin) figures have been boosted accordingly due to economies of scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these are the base numbers reported for ACO, the addition of new customers and over 1,000 physicians could open a new total addressable market for Privia Health, potentially surpassing the $10 million in additional EBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result is an EPS forecast that serves as a sanity check against the consensus numbers, pinpointing where the additional upside not yet priced into Privia Health stock comes from today, erasing some of the \"surprise\" factor as far as exogenous factors are concerned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With an updated income statement and DCF view, upside is found in Privia Health stock, while still leaving the chance of a stronger combined operation moving forward to overdeliver on these forecasts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2280\" data-height=\"1125\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Acquisition adjusted income statement model\" width=\"640\" height=\"316\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

A reasonable expectation is that volume and volatility remain tamed through the November 6th earnings release, after which a breakout in both metrics is likely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last earnings release in August 2025, the stock’s ATR jumped to 7.2% from the latest reading of 1.5%. Previous earnings volatility has yielded similar ATR readings of 7% to 9%. Considering this behavioral range, an implied move to the upside, warranted by the stock’s premium, could send Privia Health to $28.33 per share, another significant resistance area set in the second and third quarters of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All told, this price target does not fall far from the current Wall Street <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRVA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" rel=\"noopener\">consensus of $30.33 per share</a>, striking Privia Health right into that previous resistance area. Moreover, the lower end of a P/S valuation from the earlier comparables analysis ($36.32) also aligns with an August 2025 rating from JMP Securities, in which David M. Scharf set a $30 per share price target for the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chances are, if the premium on the stock is warranted in the upcoming earnings release, more analysts will have to adjust their assumptions and targets, closing the gap and justifying a higher price for the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks To Privia Health's Breakout</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buying a premium stock doesn't take risk away, and traders would be relying on a good quarter to be reported on November 6th, 2025, for this to play out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given how low EBIT margins are (1% to 2%), there is a thin margin of error; therefore, any miss on the top line could invalidate the optimistic outlooks Wall Street analysts have today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the recent acquisition from Evolent Health could support these assumptions and expectations, so the premium must be justified once the deal is closed and the new financial figures are incorporated into updated targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the technical side, traders are relying on a volume pick up for Privia Health to deliver on this breakout, given the $26.00 per share resistance level it faces today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also a significant swing in additional revenue relying on the conversion from Medicaid broad care into VBC. Under this 10% conversion assumption, a factor that could not end up being realized and affect the terminal value of Privia Health stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How the Administration chooses to undertake these benefit cuts will ultimately determine how these users react to this conversion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Should any of these fail to come in for the stock, then the risk premium increases ahead of the earnings announcement, and this entire thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the healthcare sector in itself showing a wide underperformance gap to the S&amp;P 500 index, the opportunities for price action (and valuation) rebounds abound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Privia Health shows all the signs of a potential EPS swing to bolster its valuation case, some assumption risks do exist. However, at today's price, there is enough of a margin of safety to carry investors through these risks.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the fundamental to the technical side, this is a play that carries that double-digit upside potential many are searching for in a market with frothy valuations, to say the least.</p>",

Record-high cocoa prices are squeezing margins and threatening to push candy prices higher, even as companies like Mondelez and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Hershey navigate shifting consumer behavior and input cost volatility. While some players are signaling resilience through revenue growth and strong StarMine model scores, analysts remain cautious on earnings surprises.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, retailers are leaning on aggressive discounting strategies to spur demand for costumes and décor.

Since then, Western Digital has effectively doubled, and when any stock rallies that fast, we have to take a fresh look with fresh eyes at whether it really has the capacity to rally higher. To me, high expectations are now baked into the stock, and high valuation multiples have slimmed down the possibility of further upward multiples re-rating, causing me to downgrade Western Digital to \"Neutral.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices, I see more of a balanced bull and bear case for the company. On the bright side for Western Digital:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Western Digital is seeing unprecedented levels of demand. Revenue growth continues to hang on to a ~30% y/y clip, and competitors like Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) have indicated that supply for 2026 is largely already booked out.</li> <li>Gross margin levels continue to rise. In the past, storage and memory companies have had a problem similar to airlines: boom and bust cycles that led to price wars and negative margins. In this cycle, however, Western Digital has continued to strengthen its gross margins to the mid-40%s, indicating healthy ASPs and vibrant demand.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, however, we do have to be wary of several risks:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Storage is a commoditized business. The company has no shortage of competitors, ranging from other heavyweights like Micron and Seagate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX\" title=\"Seagate Technology Holdings plc\">STX</a>) to international conglomerates like Toshiba and Samsung.</li> <li>Capex may be frontloaded, and this level of demand may not be sustained forever. Companies, especially the tech giants, are racing now to build out AI infrastructure to support new applications, but this doesn't mean that this level of demand will last in the long run. In other words, Western Digital's boom times now may represent a revenue peak that will be difficult to comp.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What ultimately leaves me more ambivalent about Western Digital, however, is the fact that the stock is no longer cheap. It was a very appealing buy a mere few months ago when it was trading at a low-teens P/E multiple; today, the stock's 21x forward P/E multiple towers over Micron, despite similar growth rates and margin tailwinds in the latter.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So while I continue to view Micron as an opportunistic buy, I think Western Digital is close to reaching the end of its rope.

Per CEO Tiang Yew Tan's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835925-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835925-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q1 earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As a result, our customers are providing greater visibility into their long-term needs, which in turn strengthens our partnership and helps us to support their future growth requirements. Our top 7 customers have now provided purchase orders extending throughout the first half of calendar year 2026. And 5 of them have provided purchase orders covering all of calendar year 2026. I'm also pleased to share that 1 of our largest hyperscale customers has signed an agreement covering all of calendar year 2027.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These longer-term commitments give us reassurance that the current demand boom and strong margin profile will be durable, at least in the medium term. We do think, however, that investors should consider the potential fallout if companies start to pull back on capex, after intense pull-forwards of investment in 2025/2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, Western Digital's margins remained hot. The company doesn't report exact ASP, but on the Q&amp;A portion of the Q1 earnings call, CFO Kris Sennesael reported \"modest low single-digits ASP per terabyte increases\" which buoyed gross margins. Gross margins of 43.9% improved 660bps y/y and 260bps sequentially versus Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the company's guidance for Q3 reflects continued improvements in gross margin. The midpoint 44.5% margin outlook for Q2 suggests 60bps of sequential strengthening:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1610\" data-height=\"718\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Western Digital Q2 outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"285\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619254822399385_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Western Digital Q2 outlook <span>(Western Digital Q1 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western Digital also notes that it has been leveraging AI to drive more efficiencies on the opex side, which is also driving investor enthusiasm: despite supporting near-30% revenue growth, pro forma opex in Q1 actually fell 9% y/y to $381 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This enabled Western Digital to build on its gross margin strength and boost its pro forma operating margins by 12 points y/y to 30.4%. The company's pro forma EPS of $1.78 more than doubled y/y, and beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.58 with 13% margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key takeaways</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western Digital remains a solid company on a powerful growth trajectory, but at the same time, I think it's reasonable to take chips off the table when the stock has already risen ~3x since the start of the year. In my view, Micron offers a better buy currently. Lock in some of your gains here and allocate elsewhere.</p>",

This comes ahead of a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the week. So what are the broader market implications? Joining me now is Phil Davis, founder of PhilStockWorld.com, from a beautiful, sunny location.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phil, always great to have you here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Hi, thanks, Kim. Very good to be here, thanks. Appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Let's start things off, if we could, about the deal that's supposed to be en route, I will say, for the US and China. They talk about a substantial framework that's going to be in place. How optimistic are you about this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> I'm less optimistic than the markets have been this week. We've seen the movie before. In January of 2020, in fact, Trump, he signed a deal with China that was supposed to be-- China was supposed to make $200 billion worth of purchases, and it took a long time, and it only worked out to 100 billion. And none of the major issues ever got resolved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So we're right back here doing the same thing again. This year, it was 145% in April, 30% in May. Now it's 45. Now he might go to 100. We don't know what's going on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> So well, let me ask you then, is there anything you've heard in this latest round of talks that you think is substantial? What's actually been agreed to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Well, when you hear framework, the framework is a framework to discuss the trade deal. It's not the trade deal itself. There's no framework to the trade deal. This is a framework to have a meeting about the trade deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a preliminary consensus, and Beijing says it's constructive, but there's no money being discussed, there's no timeline, there's no enforcement. And these are complicated things that take months to go over and fill out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just last week, they launched an investigation into whether China fulfilled any of the 2020 promises that they made. We've got major issues. We've got semiconductors, IP theft, the TikTok thing. None of that's resolved. This is a timeout at best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> So let's talk about, then, the US and Canada. Even though you're not, I'll say, optimistic about the progression with the US and China, a lot of people are a lot less optimistic right now about US and Canada. And it's interesting to note, and Canada actually got in trouble for highlighting the downside for the States that could come out of a lack of a deal. But you want to double click on that and say that is an issue. It's not just bad for Canada, it's bad for the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Oh, absolutely. But I mean, on behalf of sane Americans, I apologize for this idiocy. It was a very good commercial, by the way. The Canadian viewers should pay attention to this because the Bank of-- your Bank of Canada governor, Macklem, he laid it out. The tariffs have contradictory effects. They slow growth. They kill jobs. They push inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They obviously raise the cost of imports, which pushes more inflation up. Canada is looking at a 5% hit if we stick with these tariffs. America 2%, maybe 2.5%, probably less of an effect. But it hurts both countries. It's ridiculous.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US takes a hit, but what's really dangerous is that you break the supply chain, and those costs get passed through. You got auto parts, steel, aluminum. If you don't resolve it, you're looking at higher car prices, construction costs, both sides of the border, not just for Canada. And the Fed is trying to make policy not knowing what our trade policy is. That's insane also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Yeah, there's a lot happening. What are you watching in the upcoming week? I mean, there's a whole lot of things right now. We've got the Mag 7 reporting this week, and we've seen markets kind of key off some of that. And it's been pretty positive. You mentioned the lack of economic data that's coming out right now. What are you paying attention to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> I mean our government is closed, so it's completely ridiculous that the Fed is making multi-trillion dollar decisions with absolutely no data. They're just guessing. I mean, they're just guessing at the best of times, but this is, like, blind and guessing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What my biggest concern is in this whole thing is, if you look at the Magnificent 7 and all of their outlook and their reporting and so on and so forth, they're all just paying each other. Everyone's got their hand in everybody else's pocket, and they're just passing the money back and forth between each other. But there's no actual money coming in from consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mean, of course, there's billions of dollars coming in, but in reality, that's nowhere near enough for the $600 billion of infrastructure they're all promising to spend on each other. And it is literally on each other. Like NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) invests $100 billion in OpenAI. And OpenAI promises to buy $100 billion worth of chips from NVIDIA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's the same freaking money, but it gets reported twice. That's the most dangerous thing that in the economy, and in the outlook, and in the market capitalizations, you're having all this double, triple, quadruple reporting of the same money between the same parties. That's dangerous.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Yeah, I know you talk about it being a closed loop. And so these are just CapEx budgets getting recycled throughout the Mag 7. Can I play devil's advocate for a second, though, because when you have the startup of new industries, even if I think about railways when they first came across North America or when the Internet started, did you not have some of these closed loops in those places too? Is this just the latest version of?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Oh, what a terrible example. I'm just watching The Gilded Age, which is a really good show on HBO. And the guys, they're doing the railroads back in the day in the 1900s, and it's the same problem. You've got to build massive, massive infrastructure. And everybody is racing to build essentially the same thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's a track. It goes from one place to another, and you've got five guys building a track from Chicago to LA, but only not all of them will end up getting used. Most of the money ends up being wasted, and the system becomes so interdependent that if one goes down, they can all get pulled under. The banks can't sustain the damage when they fall apart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's what we're doing now. We're basically building railroads, and it's the same thing as when we built the telecom infrastructure in the dotcom days. You remember MCI and Sprint and five other companies, I remember, that went out? Who was that? There was a really big one that went out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anyway, they spent redundant billions. Back then a billion was a lot of money. They spent billions of dollars. Now it's like, now it's like, oops, I dropped a billion. Don't worry about it. It's an incredible system and it's going on right in front of us. Money is just being burned up on a daily basis. And it's not being replaced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Do you think-- Do you have an idea what's going to trigger something to change?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> I think the trigger-- I think there's not enough money in the world to justify spending $600 billion this year. Not this year, I think. I guess next year-- $600 billion next year of promised infrastructure spending. Everybody's reports, everybody's forward price/earnings and everything is based on the fact that they're anticipating the $600 billion to appear from somewhere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And yes, NVIDIA sells a lot of chips, but how are these guys buying the chips? How are they going to spend this kind of money on it just to have a little bit smarter AI? It's a little bit ridiculous now that they're spending the money on incremental gains in AI. They're willing to spend $100 billion just to have, version 2.4 instead of 2.3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mean, we're running out of ideas already. And the worst thing, here's the worst thing-- OpenAI has 500 million users per week, yet they only have 15 million paying customers. That means only 3% of the people who use OpenAI are willing to pay for it. That's not much money.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/billion-dollar-loop-is-big-tech-paying-itself-to-power-the-ai-boom/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

While the headline P/E ratio — currently at 21.75 — doesn’t suggest obvious undervaluation, a closer look at how net<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> income is converted into free cash flow tells a different story.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As someone who values consistent cash generation, this fits my investment style well. Over the past seven years, only one year FCF (free cash flow) has shown a negative result. Most recently, the trailing 12-month FCF stands at approximately $422 million — a strong figure, especially when taking into account the current market cap of around $1.8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"63\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"43\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761901020413712_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Cash Flow Last 7 Years <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These figures imply a price/free cash flow (P/FCF) multiple just above 4, which is definitely a very low ratio. Even more encouraging is the most recent six-month figure. Not only is it significantly stronger than last year’s result, but it also indicates a trend toward an annual cash flow of at least $500 million — especially considering that the next two quarters have historically been Kohl’s strongest in terms of cash generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1251\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"133\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17618981164218657_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Cash Flow Statement <span>(Kohl's 2Q Presentation )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, these low multiples clearly point to one thing: the market doesn’t believe these results are sustainable in the long term. It’s not too complicated to understand why - in today’s digital world, the traditional department store business model is, as widely believed, by and large, a fading one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the reason I’m still willing to move forward to research further— and not immediately call it a value trap — is because I remember a time, roughly three to four years ago, when <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/kohls-possible-sale-stock-activist-investor-buyout-offer/11504663/\" rel=\"nofollow\">buyout funds were actively competing</a> to acquire Kohl's. The story was frequently featured on CNBC, and it kind of stuck in my memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What also stayed in my mind was the buyout price range, which hovered around $60 per share. I also remember discussions about Kohl’s real estate portfolio, which was considered highly valuable and was said to be largely lease-free — or at least that’s what was claimed at the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, I’ll continue to dig deeper to see if there’s more here than just a nice stream of cash flow — which, judging by Mr. Market's perspective, appears to be considered unsustainable in the long run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this analysis, I rate Kohl’s as a Hold.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kohl's In Brief</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kohl’s began its journey in 1962 with the opening of its first department store in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The company went public in 1992, at which point it operated 76 stores across the Midwest. In 2001, Kohl’s entered the digital era when it launched its online platform, Kohls.com. Over the years, the company has continued to grow and expand, and today it operates more than 1,100 stores across 49 states, additionally supported by a well-established e-commerce presence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1683\" data-height=\"229\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A close-up of a stamp AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"87\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's in Figures <span>(Kohl's Presentation )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kohl’s has had an outstanding growth story, no doubt, especially considering the scale it has reached today. It’s now the largest independent department store in the U.S. by number of locations — with roughly 1,100 stores, compared to Macy’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/M\" title=\"Macy's, Inc.\">M</a>) around 700 and Nordstrom’s 350. In terms of revenue, Kohl’s ranks second behind Macy’s, generating around $15 billion annually versus Macy’s $22 billion. Nordstrom follows closely, with revenue in a similar range to Kohl's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge, however, is what they say — yesterday’s gains can become today’s pain. While this isn’t unique to Kohl’s, the entire department store industry is facing more or less the same headwinds - consumers are increasingly buying online. And although both Macy’s and Kohl’s have made strong efforts to grow their digital presence, those gains haven’t fully offset the pressures on their brick-and-mortar revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here lies Kohl’s unique challenge, in my view — it operates the largest department store network in the U.S. among its peers. Simple logic suggests that generating $15 billion in revenue from 400 stores, like Nordstrom, is more efficient than doing so from 1,100, or compare that to Macy’s, with fewer stores, roughly 700, and around $22 billion in annual revenue.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In today’s environment, Kohl's large-scale physical retail operations definitely feel more like a burden than a strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To gain deeper insight into the competitive dynamics, we can focus on the three remaining department store chains of a similar type still publicly traded after Nordstrom’s buyout. In addition to Macy's, there is also Dillard's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DDS\" title=\"Dillard's, Inc.\">DDS</a>), which fits that type of department store group segment. While they’re definitely not comparable on an apples-to-apples basis — given differences in client segments and marketing strategies—they’re as close as we can get.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, looking at their growth dynamics offers insight into which strategies have performed better in a challenging environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Peer to Peer Growth Analysis <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These comparisons show that over the past five years, Kohl’s has been the underdog in terms of revenue performance, while Macy’s and Dillard’s have managed to post positive overall growth during that period. That said, markets are forward-looking, and Kohl’s projected revenue decline of –4.07% for next year is nearly identical to Macy’s comparable estimate, which is definitely a positive. Another encouraging aspect of this comparison is Kohl’s EBITDA profitability: its forward-looking growth multiple, although still negative, is in line with — or even ahead of — its peer group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, this comparison clearly shows that the ongoing struggles aren’t unique to Kohl’s, but rather an industry-wide challenge. And while Kohl’s has long been the underdog, the latest data suggests they’ve done solid work recently, and the results indicate that they’re now roughly on par with their peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financials</strong></h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Latest Quarterly Results </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market reacted positively to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4489521-kohls-gives-mixed-q2-results-raises-fy-outlook\">Kohl’s latest results</a>, and shares rallied after the release of better-than-feared second-quarter earnings and an improved outlook for FY25.

After amortization, total tangible assets are reported at $7.297 billion. One might conclude that this reflects hidden real estate undervaluation. However, since real estate is recorded on the balance sheet at its purchase or construction cost and then amortized over time, it doesn’t provide a true picture of current market value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we know, the real value of property depends on what someone is willing to pay for it — the market value — not what it originally cost.

Multiplying that by 405 stores yields a total estimated real estate value of approximately $4.46 billion. Since these are very rough estimates, we can reasonably summarize that the value of Kohl’s likely owned stores falls somewhere in the $4–5 billion range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Kohl's owns distribution centers and e-fulfillment centers. Given that typical industrial or logistics real estate in the U.S. is valued at $50–$100 per square foot — depending on location, condition, and market dynamics — and considering the total footprint of 12.91 million square feet across these facilities, the estimated value range would fall between approximately $645 million and $1.29 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"520\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Distribution Centres <span>(Kohl's 2024 Annual SEC filing)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To summarize, we can conservatively estimate that Kohl’s owns real estate valued at roughly $5 billion. Since the 'Property and Equipment' segment on the balance sheet also includes approximately $2.22 billion in leased property value, the reported ~$7 billion in tangible assets appears to be a reasonable reflection of fair value — especially considering that most other tangible assets carried in balance sheet assets tend to depreciate quickly and typically hold limited value in a liquidation scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I could conclude that I didn’t find any meaningful hidden real estate value that would significantly impact Kohl’s overall valuation. However, the good news is that the assets on the balance sheet are tangible and carry justified real value, which is not always the case. In many instances, balance sheets are dominated by intangible assets like goodwill, software, and similar items that may have little to no real value, especially in a liquidation scenario.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As outlined earlier, Kohl’s price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio was slightly above 4. When we also consider the EV/EBITDA multiple — calculated at around 2.6 as seen below— it further supports the case for significant undervaluation. This figure is less than half of what would typically be expected, even under conservative assumptions for a company with a \"cash cow\" profile. Some comparable valuation approaches include other long-term financial obligations and capital leases as part of long-term debt; in Kohl’s case, that would add approximately $5 billion to its long-term liabilities. Under this adjusted method, the EV/EBITDA multiple would rise to around 6.5 — not extremely cheap, but still a relatively low valuation.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Share Price based on EV/EBITDA calculation, billions $</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>EBITDA</td> <td>1.24</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cash</td> <td>0.17</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Debt</td> <td>1.60</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net Debt</td> <td>1.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td> <td><strong>2.59</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Equity Value/Mcap</td> <td>1.79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stocks</td> <td>0.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stock Price</td> <td>16.00</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"353\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Adjusted EBITDA <span>(Kohl's 2Q Earnings Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the current share price is roughly in line with a justified valuation. While fundamental multiples could support a value up to twice as high, the underlying uncertainties — ranging from tariffs to broader threats to the business model — limit that upside potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the main risk is, as previously outlined, the execution - five CEO in five years is a great example. If they can't find the right strategy to navigate through the industry challenges, the longer-term sustainability becomes increasingly questionable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second important risk, while not specific to Kohl's, is definitely tariffs. The CEO was asked about that multiple times at the earnings call, and in my mind, he wasn't too worried. I think the case is that it's the same for all retailers. Sooner or later, they need to raise prices where needed, and every retailer must find their best approach to navigate the situation. Management’s position and approach were well articulated by the CEO on the call.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>As we have mentioned before also, we have a diversified sourcing strategy from a country standpoint. We're not heavily reliant on any one particular country, and we have the flexibility and agility to actually move production to other countries if necessary.</em></p> <p><em>The other thing that we are doing, obviously, is working with our vendor and supplier community, negotiating when we do understand and get clarity on tariffs to make sure that we're able to continue to provide the value that we need to our customers. And we're also examining what we can do with our proprietary brands from a value engineering standpoint with the product to keep cost of goods in line with the value that we need to offer to our customers.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, Kohl’s isn’t a meme stock — even if it sometimes acts like one. It’s a value play, backed by a solid balance sheet with tangible real estate assets, but, as they say, it’s skating on thin ice. Navigating a department store business model like Kohl’s, which isn’t exactly fading but isn’t thriving either, is a challenging balancing act, no doubt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s definitely a tough task for management to satisfy everyone in these circumstances — from everyday shoppers to shareholders. The fact that there have been five CEOs in five years says a lot: while everyone could have their own bold vision, the challenge here is deeper than it looks at first glance. Right now, it feels like the current (interim!) management is doing more than just creating bold visions — and from my perspective, while it's too early to draw deeper assessments, they’ve been doing it quite well.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, I’m staying on the sidelines — while the stock price feels nicely balanced, the recent stock's run from $5 to $15 has already priced in some improved execution in my view. That said, I’m ready to jump in if the price dips closer to $10 and/or if management continues to deliver encouraging signs of even stronger prospects ahead.</p>",

Additionally, the substantial, partially acquisition-related headcount increase compared to 2024, coupled with inflation-related wage increases, was a huge burden. Despite all these negatives and the difficult macro environment, after three quarters, Fuchs still delivered stable EBIT in EMEA, and the strong EBIT growth in Asia-Pacific fully compensated for the shortfall in the Americas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the mentioned forex developments effectively mask volume growth and therefore market share gains (forex-adjusted sales growth over 3% YoY), I fully expect the company to return to robust earnings growth once the general business environment stabilizes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further Considerations And Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fuchs has a pristine balance sheet with a small net cash position that can provide further optionality for share buybacks or M&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that Fuchs produces locally for its various regional markets, it can become a tariff-profiteer if importing competitors need to raise prices to compensate for import tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The German industry anxiously expects the federal government to finally announce concrete reforms and stimulus measure to boost the sluggish economy. Stimulus measures will almost certainly come into effect over the next 12 months and should improve general sentiment and stock market valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, corporate taxes are likely to be lowered from 2028. As a result, the current overall tax burden on companies should decrease from nearly 30 percent at present to about 25 percent in 2032. This development so far has been largely ignored by the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fuchs' more liquid preference share currently trades for just 16.7x expected 2025 earnings, while the voting shares are even cheaper at a 13x multiple. In my view, this is too cheap for an excellently managed, resilient, and broadly diversified company which has a stellar growth record and even in these sluggish years earns over 16% on its equity (despite not employing any leverage).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As shown in the chart below, no other month has experienced a larger median maximum drawdown. Somewhat surprisingly, though, April at -4.5% and January at -4.3% aren’t far behind. What makes the month seem even more volatile than it is, though, is that for anyone who has been around a while, two of the three largest intra-month drawdowns from a high have both occurred in October. In 1987, the S&amp;P 500 declined by more than 34% from peak to trough, while in 2008, it plunged by 28%. The only other months with an intra-month decline of more than 25% were March 2020 (-30.12%) when Covid shut down the economy, and November 2008 (-26.45%) during the financial crisis. It isn’t always a crazy month, but when it is, October sure knows how to disappoint!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1013\" data-height=\"552\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.bespokepremium.com/interactive/posts/think-big-blog/what-volatility\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

However, the main beneficiary, Nvidia Corporation (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), is expected to continue to enjoy the tailwinds of the AI infrastructure arms race thanks to its undisputed leadership in the GPU market that is growing at a rapid pace. Meanwhile, NVDA's been making recent efforts in expanding AI to new fields such as networking, edge computing, etc.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to rate NVDA as a Strong Buy, and believe that the stock price will likely appreciate rapidly after reaching the recent plateau of $5T market cap. I plan to buy more shares at any dip in the market. The stock price is still at a nice discount in terms of PEG multiples and should be a top candidate for investors who consider adding growth exposures.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA Update - A Fast but Steady AI Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia currently holds a dominant share in the GPU market, reaching 94% in Q2 of 2025, while AMD's share dropped to 6%. The increase has been ongoing. So I believe that NVDA already has had a permanent lock-in in securing the main computing business until the next disruptive technology, like quantum computing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA's flagship products are datacenter GPUs based on its industry-leading Blackwell architecture that keep their technology advantages in the market. The key main products include:<span> </span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>GB200/GB300 NVL72: These are computing supernodes that combine Grace CPUs and Blackwell GPUs designed for massive-scale AI and HPC tasks. </span></li> <li><span>RTX PRO 6000: It is a Blackwell standard server edition built for enterprise data center workloads with AI and visual computing capabilities.</span></li> <li><span>H200 Tensor Core GPU: using the preceding Hopper architecture, this product has performance enhancements for large language model (LLM) inference and HPC workloads. I believe it can also be deployed in a wide range of edge computing cases (see more details later)</span></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia is expecting the revenue to reach over $207 billion at the end of 2026 and continue to grow over 20% in the subsequent two years. Looking at the growth multiples estimated below, NVDA's progress in both earnings and sales has outpaced the projections made in January (box on the left). More specifically, the 2027 growth rates have been upgraded to higher numbers (see highlighted).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1133\" data-height=\"199\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author/SA data\" width=\"640\" height=\"112\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>NVDA Growth Estimates (Author-maintained SA Eecords)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The accelerated growth can also be evidenced by the estimates for 2028. The current version is 22.7% which is much higher than the 14.4% estimate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4777169-nvidia-ai-infrastructure-is-more-critically-needed-than-ever\">recorded</a> in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is still some <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/10/29/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-will-it-be-in-1-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\">doubt</a> about NVDA's growth on Wall Street, regarding the sustainability and magnitude of its high double-digit growth rate. However, I believe NVDA represents what true AI growth should look like at this stage. I call it a true AI growth barometer for the AI industry.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">No Sign of Slowdown in the AI Arms Race</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI has shown no signs of slowing down in the buildout of the AI infrastructure. In fact, the most recent earnings report from Microsoft indicated that it will <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510964-microsoft-outlines-fy26-capital-expenditure-acceleration-as-ai-demand-drives-80-percent-ai\">increase</a> its AI spending in 2026 from the record level in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the power of the current AI models or the differentiation of the LLM models still largely depend on the computing power to provide fast iterations and improvement. This inherently technology-driven demand will likely continue for the next few years until some kind of new generation of AI models/algorithms (e.g., AGI) takes over. This is one of the key reasons why all the mega companies, including Microsoft, Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), have announced plans to increase AI spending on infrastructure next year during their earnings report this week. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other significant evidence for sustained GPU growth is that the nuclear energy boom is directly driven by the need for much more AI datacenters. As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-boom-may-drive-over-60-surge-in-us-nuclear-capacity-by-2050/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>, the nuclear generation in the U.S. will grow by 27% in the future to in order support the operations of the AI datacenters. So GPU as the core component for these data centers would expect to grow in the same line.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Edge Use Cases will go a long way</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to the overheated field of Gen AI and large models, one lesser-known AI use case is AI <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/edge-computing/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Edge Computing. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI at the edge has been a very compelling story for quite some time because of the real-time performance that edge computing facilities can provide. A wide range of AI use cases, such as robotic AI, physical AI, will require real-time communication and highly integrated systems, such as software API calls, to work seamlessly. This is where the AI intelligence running at the edge will be much more advantageous than from a remote AI data center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following is a <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/embedded-computing/\" rel=\"noopener\">snapshot</a> of some examples from a long list of AI use cases shown on Nvidia's edge computing site:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"709\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/embedded-computing/\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Edge AI Use Cases (Nvidia)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These highlight many very exciting AI applications in industries such as Robotics, Clinics, Medical, Healthcare, City infrastructure, etc. I believe these use cases have a bright future for AI after the current wave of Gen AI. NVDA's GPUs will play a huge role and see significant growth tailwinds when these applications are developed and deployed on a full scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AI on Networking enables more Applications</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its most recent GTC event, Nvidia announced to take a <a href=\"https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nvidia-takes-1b-stake-in-nokia-which-promises-5g-and-6g-overhaul?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202025-10-30%20Light%20Reading:%20Weekly%20%5Bissue:78344%5D&amp;utm_term=Light%20Reading%20Weekly\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1Billion</a> stake in Nokia and plans to extend its AI technology to the networking areas, such as 5G and the future 6G communication and transportation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this is a significant move from NVDA to yet another important growing segment of the networking industry. The so-called \"AI-powered 6G\" will create future cellular devices capable of intelligent processing at the edge points of a telecommunication network. Some of the actual use cases will be similar to those for edge computing, as explained very well below on the Nvidia edge site.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The vast amounts of data generated by IoT sensors across various industries offer incredible opportunities to enhance services, optimize operations, and save lives. To achieve this, businesses must deploy AI computing at the network edge, enabling real-time decision-making.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The difference for networking is that the edge AI is running on the networking devices, which will have a huge installed base (like the mobile cell sites) across the world. So it is a strategic expansion in the telecommunications market for NVDA, which started with Nokia's investment and partnership.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still Relatively Cheap Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I started my first coverage on NVDA with a Strong Buy. I projected a future market cap of 10 trillion for NVDA in the whole AI megatrend. The key point was that I expected NVDA to become the market MVP upon reaching 10T instead of reaching the $5T plateau, which might not allow enough time for NVDA to overtake Microsoft or Apple as the most valued player. I also sketched a roadmap as below:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>How long will it take for NVDA to reach the $10T market cap? There are probably two phases involved. The first is that the discount can be made zero in the relatively short term in any bull cycle. This could be anytime in 2025 or as soon as after the Q4 earning report in late February when the growth is confirmed. This implies a 51% gain from the current price level. So $208 will be the target for this phase of run-up and reach the “Median-matched” level, representing about $5 Trillion market cap.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, NVDA has exceeded my expectations by accomplishing the MVP at $4T and keeps its lead with a market cap of over $5T recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> If we look at P/E valuations, the earnings growth tables shown earlier reveal a remarkable pattern from the comparison. Both January and the current (October) estimates for the one-year-ahead forward P/E are around 50, and the two-year-ahead P/Es are about 20s. Those are fairly consistent valuations derived at different times (10 months apart).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My key takeaway is that Mr. Market has done a good and fair job in recognizing the growth quality for NVDA. Consequently, it leads to a similar conclusion made previously in January that NVDA stock is still cheap despite the price having appreciated by 64% in the past ten months, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4763639-nvidia-expect-growth-momentum-to-continue-with-the-rise-of-agentic-ai\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"267\" height=\"376\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's NVDA Rating History (SA) </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using my favorite metric to monitor growth tech stock, NVDA's PEG ratio shows a deep discount at almost -30% compared to the sector median.

This stock has consistently been my top growth play in 2025. I have been adding shares at the recent price dips. I believe the stock will continue to outperform in the current AI cycle and be the first company to reach a $10T market cap if all the supporting conditions remain intact.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a secular growth stock, the main risk for investing in NVDA is the potential slowdown of the U.S. economy. Recent reports indicated there have been some layoffs in the technology companies. For example, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) plans to cut <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/amazon-lay-off-about-14000-roles-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">14000 jobs</a>. The job cut on such a large scale is typically a sign of slowing growth ahead for the company. Whether it is a company-specific issue or an issue for the whole industry will remain to be seen. This should be a key risk factor to be monitored very closely. The industry-wide slowdown will greatly impact the AI growth projection. As the dominant AI infra leader, NVDA will be hit the most.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the technology front, new disruptive innovations, such as quantum computing, could change the AI landscape completely. These are the long-term risks for GPU products. To NVDA's credit, the company has been actively investing in AI startups and developing its own quantum computing technology to keep it up with the potential challenges. NVDA investors should have such risks on their watch.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are a lot of growth opportunities in the AI technology space. We have witnessed the remarkable growth journey from the GEN AI hype to the current agentic AI (that almost all enterprise players are talking about), the physical/robotic AI, etc., and the edge AI. The GPUs have been and will continue to be at the center of AI computing power, essential for evolving AI technologies and products. NVDA's undisputed leadership position in the current GPU products will support its sales and earnings growth for many years to come. The stock remains a Strong Buy and looks very attractive at the current PEG-discounted levels. </p>",

The drug is called Attruby in the US and marketed as Beyonttra in the EU and Japan. Beyonttra is commercialized by Bayer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer A.G.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) in the EU and by Alexion, a rare disease division of AstraZeneca (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">AZN</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) in Japan. Reported analyses show that the drug causes rapid, sustained reductions in cumulative cardiovascular events. These reductions come with an early curve separation, which is an important edge of Acoramidis against its competitors.

Also, BBIO’s pipeline has produced two positive readouts in 2025, for BBP-418 studied for LGMDR9 and encaleret for ADH1. The company is planning to submit the NDAs in the first semester of 2026. Additionally, Infigratinib is in a Phase 2/3 trial, which is fully enrolled, with topline data due in early 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-1761900983835628_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"936\" data-height=\"533\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-1761900983835628_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

October 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, BBIO has another drug candidate called <a href=\"https://bridgebio.com/news/bridgebio-announces-infigratinib-is-the-first-ever-investigational-therapeutic-option-for-achondroplasia-to-be-awarded-breakthrough-therapy-designation-by-the-fda/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infigratinib</a>. This one is in Phase 3 for achondroplasia in pediatric patients. The trial is already fully enrolled, and topline data is expected in early 2026. The primary endpoint of the trial is annualized height velocity (AHV) over 12 months, and secondary endpoints include body proportionality and safety. If results come in as expected, Infigratinib could be the first oral treatment to challenge other injectable drugs for achondroplasia. Infigratinib is also studied in Phase 2/3 in hypochondroplasia, a closely related FGFR3-driven dysplasia in children.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Attruby’s Competitiveness For ATTR-CM</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, I believe it’s worth focusing on Attruby. In my view, its main competitors are Pfizer's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.co.uk/products/prescription-medicines/vyndaqel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tafamidis</a> (Vyndaqel and Vyndamax) and Alnylam's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALNY\" title=\"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">ALNY</a>) <a href=\"https://investors.alnylam.com/press-release?id=28831\" rel=\"nofollow\">vutrisiran</a> (Amvuttra). Tafamidis is an established oral TTR stabilizer with payer coverage, with a list price of over $200 thousand per year. Vutrisiran won a US label expansion in March 2025 to cover ATTR-CM. This one is a subcutaneous RNAi dosed twice yearly. It’s also more expensive than oral stabilizers, with a potential competitive advantage related to convenient, less frequent dosing schedules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, I think Attruby’s competitive advantage is its rapid and sustained effects on cumulative CV results. In fact, this alone could be an important reason for patients to switch to this drug. In the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (<a href=\"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.09.013\" rel=\"nofollow\">JACC</a>) papers published in May and September 2025, the results show that patients on Acoramidis (Attruby) had fewer heart problems overall. Specifically, about half as many total serious heart events over 30 months as those on placebo (49% lower cumulative risk). Also, Acoramidis (i.e., Attruby) seems to deliver cumulative benefits for CV events within 6 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009836204293_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1230\" data-height=\"546\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009836204293_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

October 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s worth highlighting that Attruby’s list price is around <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-bridgebios-drug-rare-heart-condition-2024-11-23\" rel=\"nofollow\">$244 thousand</a> per year. This is slightly below <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/icer-raises-cost-effective-price-pfizers-attr-drug-final-analysis-still-calls-hefty-discount\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tafamidis’s price</a>, which is approximately $268 thousand per year. However, the price differentiation may not be the main deciding factor for patients because rebates and plan-specific access rules could affect the actual final cost. That’s why sticker price matters less than contracting and coverage. That’s why I think BBIO must now focus on maintaining its edge with clinical benefits, such as swift and long-lasting benefits, and progressing its commercial rollout.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, BBIO trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\">$12.7 billion</a> market cap after its recent October 2025 report. Its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18874091\">latest financials</a> show its balance sheet holds $643.0 million in cash and $3.0 million in marketable securities. This amounts to $646.0 million in highly liquid resources against $1.9 billion in financial debt (notes due by 2027, 2029, and 2031) and other regular operating liabilities. Thus, I estimate BBIO’s enterprise value at approximately $14.0 billion at the time of this writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1118\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha.\" width=\"640\" height=\"268\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, according to Seeking Alpha’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\">dashboard on BBIO</a>, the company is projected to generate around $842.0 million in revenues by 2026. That would price BBIO at a forward EV/S of 16.6, which does seem pricey compared to its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/valuation/metrics\">sector’s median</a> forward EV/S of just 3.8. And while this could be a major valuation concern, I think BBIO’s impressive gross margins so far could justify this premium. After all, BBIO’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/profitability\">gross margins</a> track at 96.2%, which far exceeds its peers’ gross margins of 59.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Likewise, BBIO’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/income-statement\">Q3 EBIT margins</a> again improved YoY from -6849.5% in Q3 2024 to -113.0% in Q3 2025. Naturally, these are still deeply negative operating margins, but it does show how rapidly BBIO is improving its margins. And since BBIO’s topline is expected to add another $347.6 million YoY (relative to 2025), it can bring a lot of shareholder value over time for BBIO based on these trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, there are still some risks, like BBIO’s ongoing cash burn. I calculate that BBIO burned through $112.5 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/cash-flow-statement\">during Q3 2025</a>. Note that I got this figure by simply adding its cash flows from operations, CAPEX, and purchases of intangible assets (because it’s a biotech). This would imply an annualized burn rate of around $450.0 million, and a cash runway of 1.4 years, which is a yellow flag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"593\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, again, the main justification for this is BBIO’s anticipated topline growth and high gross margins. Just to give you an idea, a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\">$347.6 million</a> YoY increase in revenue by 2026 at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/profitability\">96.2% gross margin</a> translates to an extra $334.4 million in added operating inflows before operating expenses. Still, aside from cash burn concerns, there’s also some potential headline risks at this point. If BBIO’s upcoming NDAs for Encaleret and BBP-418 fail or meet serious setbacks, it could definitely send the shares lower. This is especially true for a stock that’s already trading at a premium, so make sure you size your position accordingly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Growth Bet</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, BBIO continues to execute on its promises, and growth seems on track to meet its 2026 targets. Naturally, I reckon there are valuation risks (since it trades at an obvious premium), and regulatory hurdles it must overcome in the near term for its new candidates. But aside from these issues, I feel BBIO’s rollout with Attruby definitely shows great promise for long-term investors. In my view, this is a high-margin franchise that over time justifies a GARP “Buy” rating for BBIO at these levels.</p>",

The latest development on this front is the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) issuing a </span><a href=\"https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/us-strategic-investment-australian-rare-earths-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">letter of interest</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to fund up to US $200 million for VHM's Goschen Rare Earths and Mineral Sands Project in Victoria.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This follows a similar move in September of this year, when EXIM backed US $67 million for Sunrise Energy Metals' scandium project in New South Wales. Both projects are now part of Washington's \"Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative,\" which sources say is designed to reduce dependence on China. The latter country currently dominates over 80% of global rare earth processing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A New Strategic Rare Earths Asset</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Goschen Rare Earths and Mineral Sands Project, developed by VHM Limited in northwest Victoria, is rapidly emerging as a strategic asset in the global race to secure critical minerals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With over 413,000 tons of total rare earth oxide and a proven ore reserve of 199 million tons, Goschen is designed to supply both light and heavy rare earths. Alongside valuable mineral sands like zircon and rutile, these are essential for electric vehicles, defense systems and clean energy technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The project has already cleared major regulatory hurdles, including environmental approvals and a mining license, and is positioned within a Tier 1 jurisdiction with robust infrastructure and logistics. Analysts note that its scalable design and dual revenue streams make it one of the most commercially and geopolitically attractive rare earth ventures outside of China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of Several Globally Significant Moves</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VHM CEO Andrew King called EXIM's decision a globally significant move to resolve current supply chain vulnerabilities. And it is not the only such endeavor. In September, the <a href=\"https://www.australianmining.com.au/us-to-inject-103m-into-sunrise-scandium-project/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">EXIM bank</a> had issued a similar LoI to finance Sunrise Energy Metals' Syerston scandium project, marking another strategic move to secure critical mineral supply chains outside China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The funding would cover nearly half of the project's development capital, pending the completion of a feasibility study, which is expected by late October. That analysis will incorporate updated ore reserve estimates as well as an optimized mine plan.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of a Strategic Realignment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many experts following the rare earths sector believe these types of investments aren't just financial, but geopolitical. By securing long-term supply from Australia, the U.S. is executing a \"friend-shoring\" strategy, rerouting critical inputs through trusted allies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the U.S., the supply of critical rare earths has recently become a matter of even greater concern. In April 2025, Beijing imposed export controls on several rare earth elements, effectively weaponizing its mineral dominance amid rising global tensions. American industries, from aerospace to semiconductors, depend on rare earths for magnets, batteries and precision components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now it seems the U.S. has found a strategic way to bypass China by using financing as foreign policy. By offering 12-15 year repayment terms and streamlining approvals via the Single Point of Entry framework with Australia, the U.S. is accelerating project viability and locking in <a href=\"https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/exim-bank-the-quiet-engine-behind-americas-global-economic-strategy/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">future supply</a> as part of its Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A final investment decision on Goschen and Syerston is expected within months. When that happens, these projects will become part of America's overall industrial policy. There could also be more U.S.-backed Australian lithium, cobalt and other rare earth projects in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, in Greenland</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to Australia, the U.S. has intensified its interest in Greenland's rare earth reserves. For instance, the Tanbreez deposit is particularly valuable because it contains a high proportion of heavy rare earth elements, which are more scarce and critical for high-performance applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Greenland's geopolitical significance adds another layer to this endeavor. As a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark located in the Arctic, it offers both resource potential and strategic positioning.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",
