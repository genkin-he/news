However, Trinity Capital (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRIN\" title=\"Trinity Capital Inc.\">TRIN</a></span>) has revealed itself to be the exception<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> amongst the BDC landscape. TRIN has just reported its Q4 earnings, and I wanted to revisit this BDC to provide some updated insights into its performance and outlook for 2026. While TRIN still faces some similar headwinds as peers, the portfolio strategy has proven to be effective at producing consistent cash flows, supporting dividends, and preserving investor capital. When I previously covered TRIN, I issued a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822545-trinity-capital-high-quality-bdc-but-waiting-for-a-pullback-rating-downgrade\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">hold rating</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> due to the valuation at the time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the performance over the last twelve months, we can see that TRIN's share price has declined by about 3.5%. Despite this decline, I think it's fair to call out that many BDC peers in the sector have seen their share price rapidly erode over the last quarter. Therefore, TRIN remains one of the more resilient choices in the sector. When including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 10.3% over the same time frame. TRIN now offers investors a starting dividend yield of 13.5%, while now issuing payouts on a monthly basis!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6440492439b67ad7c8e87059756a2ff9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6440492439b67ad7c8e87059756a2ff9.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6440492439b67ad7c8e87059756a2ff9.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6440492439b67ad7c8e87059756a2ff9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest earnings report indicates that net investment income still supports the distributions, but there is certainly some room for improvement. One of the most notable achievements over the last quarter is that TRIN was able to provide some meaningful NAV growth over the last quarter, which indicates that the portfolio continues to generate sufficient income through these challenging market conditions. However, valuation remains tricky because these strengths have caused the BDC to trade at the higher end of its price-to-NAV range. So let's start by taking a look at the portfolio strategy and the highlights of its most recent earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the most recent <a href=\"https://ir.trinitycapital.com/static-files/bd413a14-cf69-4e77-add9-730dccaf9735\" rel=\"nofollow\">portfolio breakdown</a>, TRIN has total investments at a fair value of $2.4B that are spread across a diverse range of debt securities. Unlike traditional equities, TRIN doesn't rely on the earnings growth of its investments. This is what makes TRIN a great hedge against the uncertainty of the market indices. Instead, TRIN invests in a portfolio of middle-market companies and relies on a borrower's ability to keep up with their required debt maintenance. TRIN's structure is most heavily reliant on loans since they make up most of its investments, but there is some exposure to other income streams. The breakdown by investment type is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Loans: 77.1%</li> <li>Equipment Financings: 13.9%</li> <li>Equity &amp; Warrants: 9%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding on this diversity, the portfolio of investments also spans across different industries. As we can see below, TRIN is most heavily allocated to finance and insurance investments at 15.1% of assets. This is followed by an allocation to medical devices and SaaS investments, which accounts for 10% and 9.2% of assets, respectively. With the selloff of SaaS companies, TRIN has remained resilient since it makes up only a fraction of its portfolio. This is the strength of TRIN's diversity. However, there is a sizeable allocation to different sub-sectors of technology, including AI &amp; automation and green technology investments. If the entire tech industry experiences an extended downturn, this could be a source of risk at some point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720448830958035_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"957\" data-height=\"311\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720448830958035_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TRIN portfolio breakdown by industry\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"208\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720448830958035_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720448830958035_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720448830958035_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720448830958035_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TRIN Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TRIN recently reported its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556642-trinity-capital-nii-of-052-in-line\">Q4 earnings</a>, and I believe the results were solid. Most notably, net investment income amounted to $0.52 per share, which represents a decline from the prior year's net investment income of $0.58 per share. Interestingly, TRIN saw a rise in its interest and dividend income over the quarter, but the operating expenses substantially increased. Total interest income and dividend income amounted to $77.5M, which was an increase from the prior year's total interest and dividend income of $66.3M. The higher interest income is a clear indication that TRIN's new investments have continued to materialize and are now producing a higher level of income within the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, total operating expenses landed at $43.6M for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by an uptick in the interest expenses and other debt financing costs, which now total $23.8M. This was an increase from the prior year's interest expenses of $19M. There was also a slight increase in compensation benefits being paid out, which now totaled $14.8M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720520807128232_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1882\" data-height=\"685\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720520807128232_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TRIN financial highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720520807128232_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720520807128232_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720520807128232_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720520807128232_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TRIN Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the weaker aspects of the earnings report was the fact that TRIN faced net realized losses of $33.9M on its investments. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that positions are struggling to grow in value. These losses were attributed to the conversion of two debt positions, which is just the result of some rotations implemented within its portfolio. This was essentially offset by $33.4M in unrealized appreciation from investments during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a balance sheet perspective, there is still some room for improvement. For instance, total cash and equivalents now amounts to $19.1M. While this is an increase from the prior year's balance of $9.6M, this is offset by a rise in liabilities. During the quarter, TRIN added another $198M in secured notes, while the credit facility rose to $373.9M. The shifts over the quarter ultimately led to total liabilities rising to $1.39B, up from $951M from the prior year. As long as this debt eventually leads to higher income, it may not be such an issue at this time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Risk Profile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time of my last coverage, TRIN traded at a premium to NAV of 21.4%. Following the latest pullback in its share price, TRIN now trades at a slightly smaller <a href=\"https://cefdata.com/funds/trin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">discount to NAV</a> of 12.09%. For reference, TRIN has traded at an average premium to NAV of 7.72% over the last five years. Referring to the red line on the graph below, we can see how TRIN trades at a much higher premium to NAV than peers. However, the valuation can be a bit tricky because a BDC's price to NAV level is usually a direct reflection of the sentiment. If a BDC is perceived as high quality by the market, it can trade at a massive premium to NAV and this makes it difficult to get in at an attractive level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720450044558651_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1092\" data-height=\"651\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720450044558651_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TRIN premium to NAV valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720450044558651_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720450044558651_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720450044558651_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720450044558651_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CEF Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the decline in its premium to NAV valuation, I think a highlight from the quarter was the rate of capital allocated to new investments. As management is able to allocate capital towards new investments, TRIN's base assets will continue to rise, and the earnings may increase as these new investments begin to materialize throughout the course of the year. During the quarter, TRIN was able to originate <a href=\"https://ir.trinitycapital.com/news-releases/news-release-details/trinity-capital-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">$543.1M</a> in total new commitments, including $170.7M allocated to five new portfolio companies, with another $264M allocated to twenty-five existing portfolio companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These new investments were offset by exits and repayments of $218.8M during the quarter. Overall, TRIN experienced a positive net increase of $192.1M in portfolio activity for the quarter, ultimately contributing to the positive NAV growth. TRIN's positive NAV growth is a clear indication of the efficiency of the portfolio. TRIN has been able to consistently increase its NAV since Q1. For reference, here are the quarter-end NAV amounts over the last year:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Q4 2024: $13.35 per share</li> <li>Q1 2025: $13.05 per share</li> <li>Q2 2025: $13.27 per share</li> <li>Q3 2025: $13.31 per share</li> <li>Q4 2025: $13.42 per share</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the NAV growth, there are still some risks that should be considered. These risks are mostly from a macro perspective and will be driven by the direction of interest rates. If we remain in a higher for longer environment, there's always a chance that non-accruals can increase. Thankfully, non-accruals remain relatively low, now totaling 0.7% of fair portfolio value. This represents a slight decline from the non-accruals totaling 0.9% of fair portfolio value at the time of my last coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So therefore, I don't believe TRIN presents any glaring red flags that investors should remain cautious of. Instead, the issues may arise as a result of unfavorable market conditions. If you want exposure to the BDC market, I would actually consider TRIN to be one of the lowest risk opportunities in the market right now. Just as a point of reference, we can see how TRIN is now one of the best performing BDCs over the last year. While the rest of the sector suffers from rising non-accruals, lower earnings, shrinking dividend coverage, and difficulty investing into new opportunities, TRIN has been able to differentiate itself through a strong portfolio strategy and efficient capital allocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_233f28aa315a4dca3d7db54ff4865c07.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_233f28aa315a4dca3d7db54ff4865c07.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_233f28aa315a4dca3d7db54ff4865c07.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_233f28aa315a4dca3d7db54ff4865c07.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the tricky valuation, I believe that these are clear signs that it is a great time to accumulate. When interest rates eventually do decline, this will improve the operating spread for TRIN between the cost of its leverage and yield collected from portfolio companies. A healthier cost of debt would also provide some relief for existing portfolio companies, which may lead to higher valuations and lead to net realized gains.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thin Dividend Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRIN/dividends/history\">declared</a> monthly distribution of $0.17 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 13.5%. It should be noted that TRIN has recently converted its payout frequency to a monthly basis, which is great for investors that depend on the income generated within their portfolio! If we take this new monthly distribution and multiply it by three months, we get an estimated quarterly payout of $0.51 per share. As previously mentioned, net investment income amounted to $0.52 per share for the quarter. While the distribution is still supported by earnings, the base coverage is quite thin at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no indication of any spillover income available either, so a scenario where non-accrual rises may threaten the sustainability of payouts. As we've seen over the last quarter, sentiment can change quite rapidly, so I would love to see net investment income stay above the $0.55 range so that there is some excess income that can offset any headwinds. Despite these concerns, the portfolio strength looks great, and the new investments may eventually materialize to higher earnings through 2026. Therefore, I believe that TRIN is still a solid choice for income investors at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720453036902275_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1086\" data-height=\"395\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720453036902275_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TRIN dividend history\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720453036902275_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720453036902275_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720453036902275_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720453036902275_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, investors should consider the fact that distributions received from TRIN may not offer tax efficiency. Since the distributions are being supported by interest income received from borrowers, the income would be classified as ordinary dividends, which have the greatest tax burden for investors. Therefore, a position in TRIN would be best utilized within a tax-advantaged account for investors looking to limit their overall tax liability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I am upgrading my rating on TRIN to a buy at this time. The share price still trades at the higher end of its price-to-NAV range, but it is often very difficult to find an attractive entry on these higher quality BDCs. The portfolio remains resilient, and non-accruals are low, which reinforces the quality of management's underwriting. The earnings saw a slight decline due to higher operating costs, but this shouldn't be an issue as long as the new investment activity eventually materializes into higher net investment income. The distributions are supported by earnings, and the new monthly frequency makes it a great option for investors seeking a reliable stream of income within their portfolio.</p>",

This company works like a liquidity provider, whose profitability is directly correlated with the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> VIX index and trading volumes, rather than economic health. In February 2026, the share price fluctuates around the $40 range. While the P/E rate appears low, just 7.7x, compared to the sector</span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">'s median of around 14x, this reflects the cyclical 2025 peak, rather than a sustainable trend.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors need to understand that <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/news/financemagnates%3A733d6de1e094b%3A0-virtu-financial-s-trading-income-jumps-34-in-2025-amid-market-volatility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2025 </a>was exceptional: annual revenue jumped to $3.63 billion, and adjusted <a href=\"https://fintool.com/app/research/companies/VIRT/earnings/Q4%202025\" rel=\"nofollow\">EPS</a> reached $5.73. Though the current dividend yield has shrunk to around 2.4%, which is way lower than the historical 4-5% average, suggesting that the share price is currently not low. The company in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/news/financemagnates%3A733d6de1e094b%3A0-virtu-financial-s-trading-income-jumps-34-in-2025-amid-market-volatility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bought</a> back shares for $135 million, though this is more to maintain the price, rather than create new value. This is an instrument for portfolio hedging, not so much an engine for long-term capital accumulation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Virtu Financial works like a financial liquidity provider, whose revenue depends on trading volumes and volatility. The company is making operations in over 235 markets and exchanges in 36 countries, trading over 25,000 different financial instruments. The main source of revenue is the bid-ask spread, and it makes up millions of transactions per day. In 2025 Q4, the company reached an average adjusted net trading income (ANTI) of $9.7 million per day. This directly correlates with the market's activity: when the VIX index is higher, margins expand, and in calmer periods, they pull back. EPS in 2025 reached $5.73, which suggests a significant efficiency compared to the historical average of $3-$4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company<span></span>'s activity is divided into two segments: market making and execution services. The market making remains a dominating segment, at the end of 2025, generating around $7.8 million ANTI per day, which makes up around 80% of the whole trading income. This segment is identified with high profitability; the trading segment <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/virtu-financial-q4-2025-slides-reveal-recordhigh-trading-income-strong-margin-growth-93CH-4473342\" rel=\"nofollow\">EBITDA </a>margin in 2025 Q4 reached 72%. The second segment, execution services, works like a more stable revenue flow, servicing institutional clients through algorithmic orders and the ITG platform. This segment in 2025 reached $2.0 million average daily income, growing for the 7th quarter in a row. Even though execution services make up a smaller part, they still cover fixed costs in periods when the market<span></span>'s volatility is low.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Virtu Financial shares are currently traded at around $40, with a 7.7x P/E. This is a significant discount compared to a 5 year historical average, which reaches 10.2x. The market currently values VIRT like a stagnant asset, despite the fact that in 2025, adjusted EPS reached $5.73. For comparison, the overall financial sector is usually traded at 12-14x P/E. This low of a valuation for the company shows that investors have doubts if the company will be able to maintain this profitability if the market volatility were to slow down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is only at 7.4x. This is way lower than the broader capital markets sector median, which is usually over 11x. Such a low ratio looks unusual, considering that in 2025 total revenue grew by 26% and reached $3.63 billion. Also, more importantly, adjusted EBITDA grew 52% in a year to $1.4 billion. Q4 Trading segment EBITDA margins reached 72%, which confirms the business model's ability to generate cash flows without additional costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Book value per share currently is $17.14. This makes the price-to-book ratio 2.3x. Even though the ratio is over the sector<span></span>'s average, it<span></span>'s justified because of a very high asset utilization efficiency. P/S is reaching 1.7x, which is lower than most technology-enabled financial companies. Current valuation suggests a clear gap between the growth of fundamental indicators and the contraction of share price multiples.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Virtu Financial's valuation shows a big gap between the main competitors and the broader capital markets sector. VIRT shares are traded at an 8.0x forward P/E rate, which is drastically lower than the sector<span></span>'s average, which reaches around the higher teens to twenties. For comparison, exchange operators such as Nasdaq (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDAQ\" title=\"Nasdaq, Inc.\">NDAQ</a>) or Cboe Global Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBOE\" title=\"Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\">CBOE</a>) are usually valued at an 18-22x range, because of their stable revenues. VIRT's P/B ratio is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIRT/key-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reaching</a> around 2.1x, while the closest competitors, for example, BGC Group or Charles Schwab, are traded at a 3.7x ratio. The market completely applies a discount for VIRT shares, because their business model is directly linked to the market<span></span>'s volatility and trading volumes, which are very unpredictable, opposite to exchange operators with their subscription and data sales revenues. This valuation gap suggests that investors consider VIRT not a growth, but rather a dividend yield instrument, demanding a high-risk premium for the cyclicality of profits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share buybacks and dividends</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Virtu Financial sticks to a conservative, fixed dividend policy and pays out $0.24 per share every quarter. This makes up a $0.96 yearly payment, which hasn<span></span>'t changed for a few years. At a current share price of around $40, dividend yield is 2.4%, which is much lower than the historical average of this company, which is 4-5%, though this drop happened, not because of dividend lowering, but because of rapid share price growth, because of successful 2025 results. The most important indicator here is the payout ratio. The company, through 2025, earned $5.73 adjusted EPS, so allocation for dividends is only about 19% of net profit. This suggests that the dividend is very safe, even if the market<span></span>'s volatility in the future decreases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Throughout 2025 Virtu Financial for share buybacks spent $135.3 million. For this amount, they bought and terminated 3.5 million of their shares. Even though this seems like a solid amount, it only makes up around 4% of the market capitalization. The total number of shares outstanding in the market decreased to 84.9 million units. Also worth noticing is that the management makes purchases opportunistically, so when the share price goes down, the buyback pace increases, though in 2025, when the shares had risen, buyback intensity was moderate. Despite that, regular share reduction mechanically increases the EPS ratio, even if gross profit remains stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All together with dividends and share buybacks, the total yield is reaching around 6.5%. This is a solid ratio in the financial sector, though investors have to keep in mind the balance structure. At the end of 2025, the company had $1.13 billion in cash, and long-term debt reached $2.07 billion. Considering that in 2025 adjusted EBITDA reached $1.4 billion, the company has enough flows both for debt servicing and further capital return to shareholders. Current valuation suggests that the market has already priced in the success of 2025, so expecting a further rapid yield growth without higher market chaos, which increases VIRT<span></span>'s revenues, would be naive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk for the VIRT business model is that in 2025-2026 SEC “Reg NMS” amendments come into effect. From 2025 to May 2026, a mandatory reduction in minimum tick size to $0.005 or even $0.001 for some shares, which directly lowers bid/ask spreads. Since VIRT in 2025 generated $2.44 billion net trading income exactly from these spreads, their contraction means lower revenues for the same amount of trades. This is a structural profitability decrease, which cannot be compensated for by higher turnover alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second risk is the high dependency on the market<span></span>'s volatility, which in 2025 was very high. In Q4, VIRT reached a record EPS of $1.85, when the VIX index was usually over 18. Though historically the VIX average is around 15. If the market stabilises in 2026 and the VIX drops to the 12-13 level, profits may decrease more than 50%, no matter if the company stays efficient. Also, December 2025, received a $2.5 million SEC fine for customer data protection gaps, showing that operational risks remain high, while regulators attention to algorithmic trading is only increasing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Virtu Financial started 2026 not like a growth story, but rather like a cyclical market<span></span>'s volatility position. 2025 results were exceptional; revenues grew to $3.63 billion, and adjusted EPS reached a $5.73 rate. Though the current 7-8x P/E ratio is looking more like the market<span></span>'s skepticism on the sustainability of these results, rather than a structural discount. Virtu's profitability directly depends on the trading volumes and VIX index, so without increased market chaos, these profit levels could be hard to replicate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though dividend policy remains conservative, and the payout ratio is only reaching around 19%, the current 2.4% yield suggests that the share is not cheap anymore. Buybacks and capital returns give additional support for the price, though it's more of a support mechanism than a strategy for long-term value creation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuing the risk, upcoming \"Reg NMS\" changes, and possible market volatility decrease could significantly impact bid-ask differential profitability. So Virtu today works more like a portfolio hedging or tactical cyclical instrument, than a stable long-term capital growth investment. Further returns will depend on the market<span></span>'s anxiety and trading activity levels, rather than economic growth.</p>",

Markets are positioned for<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> lower inflation, with the 2Y inflation swap marking 1.75% now, which is well below the European Central Bank’s target. Nevertheless, only 7bp of ECB easing is priced in for 2026, suggesting the probability of another rate cut is just 30%. This means that markets are content with an undershoot and don’t see the need for the ECB to respond.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we get lower CPI readings from the major eurozone countries today, then the case for more ECB cuts could quickly build – especially since rates seem keen to test lower the past few weeks. But also in the other direction, we see upside risks. The long end of the curve is still not fully confident that the ECB can keep inflation close to target over the long run. The 10Y inflation swap is still below 2%, even though in pre-quantitative easing times this number was usually around 2.2%, suggesting a 20bp risk premium. In effect, if we start seeing a series of strong inflation data in the coming months, then that could also push the back end up materially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil remains one piece of the inflation puzzle, but more recently the euro exchange rate and gas prices are more important driving forces behind rates. Gas prices jumped higher in January but have since lowered again. In the opposite direction, we had a sharp appreciation of the euro, but this has also broadly reverted since its January peak. That means we’re in quite a balanced position in terms of inflation expectations now. This is also reflected by the fact that both 2Y and 10Y inflation swaps are trading close to their six-month average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, we see that global rates markets are holding on to their bullish momentum. The AI jitters continue to keep risk sentiment on edge, and private credit concerns don't help either. We still think rates have come down too far, especially when seeing euro equities hitting new records. On the other hand, we don't see much willingness for rates to pop back up again, raising the question of whether investors are becoming more keen to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874408-investors-may-turn-to-egbs-amid-equity-jitters\" rel=\"noopener\">add some safety</a> to their portfolio in the form of euro bonds.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation swaps suggest markets are positioned for an undershooting</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721816266770847_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1749\" data-height=\"841\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721816266770847_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Inflation swaps suggest markets are positioned for an undershooting\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721816266770847_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721816266770847_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721816266770847_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721816266770847_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Friday’s events and market views</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets will be watching French, Spanish and German CPI numbers, which will help build expectations for the eurozone aggregate number coming on Tuesday.

For the full year, the company generated $0.56 of FFO, down from $0.68 in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was actually flat at $74 million, but rising interest expense has reduced cash flow. The company’s share price has been negatively impacted by revised <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4786526-clipper-realty-attractively-valued-despite-property-specific-headwinds\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4786526-clipper-realty-attractively-valued-despite-property-specific-headwinds\" target=\"_blank\">rental regulations</a> in New York, which generally limit lease rate inflation to 2.75% and make it harder to convert units out of rent stabilization.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Residential results were solid, but political risk looms</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its residential division, new leases were up 13%, with renewal rates also up a strong 7%. As a result, revenues grew by $2.7 million to $31 million, primarily from increased rents at stabilized properties. Additionally, its Prospect House property in Brooklyn is successfully leasing up, with occupancy now up to 66% and most of its unregulated units yet to be leased. We should see a substantial increase from the $1.5 million of revenue generated in Q4 from this property as it completes its lease-up and gets to a run-rate footing, likely around midyear 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The election of Mayor Zohran Mamdani in New York has added further uncertainty to the space, given his focus on this issue. In particular, he campaigned on freezing rent and is <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/news/mamdani-rent-guidelines-board-rent-freeze/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.amny.com/news/mamdani-rent-guidelines-board-rent-freeze/\" target=\"_blank\">taking steps</a> to do that via appointments to the Rent Guidelines Board. Mamdani has also pushed to increase housing construction, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/nyc-mayor-mamdani-talks-housing-with-president-trump-at-the-white-house/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/nyc-mayor-mamdani-talks-housing-with-president-trump-at-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> with President Trump on this issue. At some point, these competing policy priorities may come into conflict, as rent restrictions may reduce the attractiveness of developing new apartments. Regardless, the overall policy stance is not particularly friendly towards residential landlords like Clipper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its Flatbush Garden complex is its primary rent-regulated building. The property generated $13.2 million of revenue, up about 7% from last year, and its leased rate was strong at 98.2%. It was able to push leased rates to $32/square foot from $30 last year. There is a risk that revenue growth could slow materially on this property if Mamdani’s policy goals are achieved. Its Tribeca property, which has less rent regulation exposure, saw revenue jump nearly 10% to $11.7 million, and occupancy is excellent at 99.4%. On this property, CLPR charges $89/sqft, and that gap speaks to how beneficial having market-oriented apartment exposure is relative to rent-regulated units.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it is also important to note that while the national residential rental market is battling negative rent, New York City has been a significant outperformer, aided by less supply post-COVID than in Sun Belt markets. Rents are still rising, up 2% from last year. With new construction levels fairly muted, any supply-side effort is unlikely to hit the market before 2028/2029. As such, in non-rent-regulated units, I expected continued positive rental inflation. Outcomes in rent-regulated units are much harder to predict and have meaningful political uncertainty associated with them.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13071522-1772153782709281_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"964\" data-height=\"607\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13071522-1772153782709281_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13071522-1772153782709281_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13071522-1772153782709281_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13071522-1772153782709281_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13071522-1772153782709281_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ApartmentList</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tenant loss hampers office results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its commercial unit has faced more difficulties as the city government exited its 250 Livingston Lease, and 141 Livingston faced claims from creditors. Revenue was down $3.6 million from last year to $6.2 million, entirely due to developments on 250 Livingston. Because it lost the city government lease, revenue from 250 Livingston declined by over 80% to $600k, coming from 36 residential units in the building. I previously wrote that finding a tenant in this office market would be very difficult and assumed no new tenant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recognizing this, CLPR has stopped making interest and tax payments on this property, essentially defaulting on its mortgage. This loan, like the majority on CLPR’s properties, is nonrecourse. That means Clipper can walk away from an underwater building like 250 Livingston, and lenders have no claim on the rest of its assets. Rather than fund losses out of cash flow from other buildings, management has determined the building to be worth less than the outstanding debt on it. Unless lenders materially modify the mortgage, it is likely to be foreclosed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, the lender on 141 Livingston had alleged CLPR breached covenants by failing to maintain a $100 million net worth. CLPR was able to resolve all claims by posting a $10 million letter of credit and incurring $2.6 million of settlement expenses. Importantly, this allows the 5-year lease with its main tenant, the city government, to go through.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The balance sheet offers flexibility</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to its balance sheet, Clipper has $1.3 billion of debt, and it also has $31 million of cash. Net debt was flat over the past year. As noted above, CLPR primarily borrows at the property level. This provides flexibility as property fundamentals change. For instance, it has $125 million against its 250 Livingston property, which we may see exit its balance sheet. Its two primary mortgages are the $360 million against Tribeca House, one of its best-performing assets, and its $329 million against Flatbush Gardens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, the company has no near-term maturities. However, many of these loans carry low-rate mortgages. Most notably, its Flatbush Gardens loan is at 3.125%. This does not mature until 2032, but we are likely to see a materially higher interest rate given both the absolute level of rates and negativity around rent-regulated exposure, and this is likely to add several million in run-rate annual interest expense.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend should be secure in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares offer an 11% dividend yield. During 2025, Clipper generated $23 million of operating cash flow, down from $32 million last year, though this still covered its $18.5 million of dividend payments. As a general rule, whenever I see a double-digit dividend yield, that is an immediate warning sign that markets believe the payout may not be sustained. The company did fully cover its dividend in 2025; however, this included a partial-year contribution from 250 Livingston. On the other hand, Prospect House is still leasing up. In Q4, CLPR did not cover its dividend. Once we get to run-rate on Prospect House and exit 250 Livingston, we should see ~$0.06 of benefits. At $0.10 per quarter, CLPR barely covers its dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, given the dynamics discussed above, we should see ongoing rental inflation at all non-regulated units, but there is considerable uncertainty about the path forward on H2 rent-regulated units and whether a freeze could be implemented. Given the fact operating expenses do rise over time, a rent freeze could erode cash flow. At this time, I expect a deceleration in rent inflation, but I do not view 0% as the base case either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Depending on the outcome here and the speed of the Prospect House lease-up, I expect $0.38-$0.44 of FFO, which protects the dividend this year. That said, over the medium term, Clipper’s interest expense is likely to rise as it refinances maturities, though this is not a pressing issue until the 2028-2032 period. Still, by 2032, interest expense could be $15 million higher, or over $0.30/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, much depends on the rate environment, which is completely unknowable several years from now. This thought is where the medium-term trajectory of rents becomes essential. With 2.5+% rent inflation, CLPR can grow the topline sufficiently to absorb higher rates, but at 1.5% or lower, interest expense will begin to squeeze the dividend. Shares are yielding 11%, in part reflecting this medium-term risk.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">I remain a \"buy,\" given depressed valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do not expect a change to dividend policy in 2026 or likely even 2027, but there is uncertainty beyond then. That said, CLPR’s balance sheet structure of nonrecourse loans gives it a tremendous amount of flexibility and truncates downside on any single property. After the decline in shares and at sub-9x 2026 FFO, it seems to me that all the political risk is being priced in already, and fundamentals outside rent-regulated units are still quite solid in the NYC area.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I remain a \"buy.\" Given the increased political overhang from the NYC mayoral election (a risk I admittedly took too lightly last May, leading to my erroneous buy rating), I no longer think shares can get to $5, but I view 10x FFO as attainable as we see Prospect House results improve and AFFO cover the dividend. With upside towards $4.00 plus its 11% yield, I view CLPR as having attractive upside, though the political environment remains a risk.</p>",

The most critical factor is charging time. AC chargers require a vehicle’s onboard converter to change from AC to DC. In contrast, DC chargers can convert power inside the station and send it directly to the EV battery. This can juice an EV to 80% in under an hour compared to about 4-10 hours for AC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"769\" data-height=\"627\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Share of Public DC and AC Chargers\" width=\"640\" height=\"522\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Share of Public DC and AC Chargers <span>(THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second factor is range anxiety. While AC chargers are installed in residential and workplace settings, DC chargers serve en route locations such as highways and urban hubs, where faster charging directly addresses range anxiety. In the US, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program had allocated $5 billion to build DC charging networks along highways. But these didn’t exactly pan out amidst <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-reopen-nevi-funding\" rel=\"noopener\">opposition</a> from the federal government last year. Regardless, I think the trendline remains clear. Just a few days ago, Nayax signed an <a href=\"https://www.nayax.com/news/nayax-tritium-global-ev-charger-payment-partnership/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">agreement</a> with Tritium, a DC charging manufacturer, to integrate its payment hardware across a charging network spanning over 50 countries.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>So we're seeing a high demand. Q4 is always -- is a big enterprise, and we have a very, very good visibility to end this quarter with the expectation that we set to the market. - Yair Nechmad, CEO of Nayax at 3Q25 Results</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, management also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845608-nayax-ltd-nyax-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">mentioned</a> an acceleration in enterprise sales.

However, they appeared confident in staying in the higher end of 30%-35% hardware margins, which I think implies that enterprise sales are consistent with and not dilutive to those higher margins.

But I also think the edge in valuation disappears if the market perceives the discount rate as being structurally higher to account for AI risks. Unfortunately, this isn’t a company issue but a macro issue, which makes the stock behave like a long-duration asset. Because of this factor, I thought the stock could keep drifting in and out of the first two regimes below.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Regime</td> <td>Fair Value</td> <td>Interpretation</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution + normal discount rate</td> <td>~$66–$78</td> <td>Moderate upside</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution + high discount rate</td> <td>~$46 - $50</td> <td>Fairly valued</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution miss</td> <td>&lt;$40</td> <td>Real downside</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the execution remains on course and discount rates normalize, there is meaningful upside. If the discount rate remains high, the equity drifts sideways. Only under conditions of weak execution does the thesis break decisively. So a market-perform or hold rating makes sense for a macro call on a fundamentally improving business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operationally, Nayax is at its strongest point, and the company's growth levers are structurally sound. For the investor who bought at a $44 price point, the stock has offered a decent return in a short period of time. This is especially true if you managed to sell at the $60 highs seen last month.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to like the company. I am just a little less enthusiastic about the entry point where the broader market is compressing multiples and is demanding faster resolution of growth stories. A pullback to the mid-40s without a clear operational reason would provide a higher margin of safety to accumulate. Otherwise, I expect the stock to move in line with market sentiments in the near term.</p>",

The S&amp;P 500 appears to be stuck at levels just shy of 7,000 as the market struggles to find direction. The tech stocks that<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> have powered much of the market's dizzying ascent over the past few years are mostly in deep correction territory. Meanwhile, consumer-facing companies, including those in the restaurant sector, are also facing persistent challenges as investors worry about inflationary pressures plus macro headwinds on restaurant traffic.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But against this backdrop, Shake Shack (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a></span>) remains one of my favored plays in the restaurant space. The elevated burger chain has continued to deliver healthy comps that compare well against other \"fast casual\" restaurant chains. Despite this, shares remain down ~10% over the past year, still creating a well-timed buying opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_1df9fad0fe5d7a58cae7b37e6a23cd36.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_1df9fad0fe5d7a58cae7b37e6a23cd36.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_1df9fad0fe5d7a58cae7b37e6a23cd36.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_1df9fad0fe5d7a58cae7b37e6a23cd36.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4836139-shake-shack-q3-execution-stock-correction-attractive-value-upgrade-buy\">I last wrote a buy opinion</a> on Shake Shack in October, when the stock was trading at ~$90 per share. Since then, Shake Shack has enjoyed a meaningful uptrend even as the rest of the stock market has floundered. Amid healthy guidance looking ahead to FY26, amid the company noting that sales trends have improved materially in the early part of Q1, I'm reiterating my <strong>buy </strong>rating on Shake Shack.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well positioned for success in 2026, with reasonable valuation against a robust outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, there are two core catalysts that Shake Shack can count as tailwinds in the upcoming year. The first is that the company continues to expand into new international markets via licensing deals. In Q4, the company grew its sales from licensed locations by 26% y/y to $232.7 million, which is 38% of the company's systemwide sales of $618 million. Licensing fee revenue (Shake Shack's cut of these sales) grew 28% y/y to $15.3 million, still a small 4% slice of overall sales - and yet, it's also a \"free\", high-margin revenue stream that allows Shake Shack to substantially expand its brand presence with low capital needs and low risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"908\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack licensed openings\" width=\"640\" height=\"568\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"568\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack licensed openings <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past few months alone, the company has opened locations in Hong Kong, Philippines, Shanghai, Canada, Israel, Korea, and others - as shown above. The company expects to open 40-45 new licensed locations in FY26, representing meaningful growth from its current base of 286 licensed stores. This stacks on top of 55-60 planned company-owned and operated locations, marking 2026 as a meaningful year for Shake Shack's brand expansion: both in the U.S. and overseas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other core catalyst for investors to keep in mind is the fact that within the company's owned and operated portfolio, Shake Shack is getting the hang of more efficient operations. Whereas many restaurant chains are getting bogged down by higher labor costs, Shake Shack has overhauled its labor model to reduce labor costs (as a percentage of revenue), helping to offset the impacts of beef price inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"970\" data-height=\"310\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack labor trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack labor trends <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has allowed the company to keep growing adjusted EBITDA at a double-digit pace, even as its new restaurant openings are just at the point of maturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its many growth catalysts, Shake Shack continues to trade at very reasonable valuations. At current share prices near $99, Shake Shack commands a market cap of $4.21 billion. Netting off the $360.1 million of cash and $247.7 million of debt on Shake Shack's most recent balance sheet, the company's resulting enterprise value is $4.10 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY26, Shake Shack is guiding to $1.60-$1.70 billion of revenue, or 14% midpoint revenue growth, with 55-60 company-owned openings stacking on top of low single-digit same-shack sales (comp sales) growth, both contributing to double-digit top line expansion. The company is also expecting restaurant-level margins of 23.0-23.5%, representing up to one point of full-year expansion versus a 22.6% margin in FY25. Adjusted EBITDA, at a midpoint of $241 million, represents a 14.6% margin (+10bps y/y) and 15% y/y growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"932\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"775\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"775\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack outlook <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack's valuation is positioned at 17.0x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA.

The core driver of acceleration was the addition of 15 new company-owned Shacks in Q4, as well as 17 net-new licensed locations. As previously mentioned, though licensing revenue is still a small ~4% slice of overall revenue, the 28% y/y growth rate here (plus the plan to grow licensed locations by another ~16% in FY26) makes this an incredibly high-margin growth lever for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the most important metric for us to watch here is same-shack sales growth (which other restaurants refer to as \"same restaurant sales\" or \"comp sales\" and measures revenue growth from existing locations, without including the contribution of newly opened locations).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1672\" data-height=\"1140\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack SSS trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"436\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"436\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack SSS trends <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good news is that same-shack sales continued on a recent positive trend, up 2.1% y/y with 160bps of price increases and a favorable menu mix further buoyed by 50bps of y/y traffic increase. This is the company's second consecutive quarter of positive traffic, after y/y declines earlier in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bad news is that comps decelerated from ~5% growth in Q3. The major headwind here remains the company's core New York City market, where same-shack sales declined -2% y/y. That said, the company noted adverse weather impacts as driving declines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We note as well that deceleration is more the rule rather than the exception in the industry. Burger King (BK), arguably the company's largest pure-play competitor, though leaning in the fast food space instead of \"fast casual,\" saw comps decelerate to 5.8%, from 6.4% in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1974\" data-height=\"556\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Burger King comps trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"180\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Burger King comps trends <span>(Restaurant Brands Q4 results)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Mediterranean chain CAVA barely grew comps at all, decelerating 140bps sequentially to 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CAVA comps trends\" width=\"610\" height=\"402\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"610\" data-height=\"402\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CAVA comps trends <span>(CAVA Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we are beginning to see the market make an apparent shift toward promotion-oriented fast food brands. McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) had the most successful Q4 of most restaurant chains, with U.S. comps accelerating to 6.8% in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we do think Shake Shack, especially with its chef-driven roots and higher quality, maintains a clear distinction versus fast food burgers. We're also encouraged by the fact that Shake Shack noted January comps improved to over 4%, indicating that Q1 same-shack sales may be positioned to recover back to Q3 levels. Per CEO Robert Lynch's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875347-shake-shack-inc-shak-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Finally, I would like to give some color on our strong start to the year. January same-Shack sales grew 4.3% year-over-year. Despite meaningful weather headwinds in January, we've nevertheless generated solid sales growth, fueled by continued traction in our in-app value platform, increased hours of operations in our Shacks and the launch of compelling culinary innovation.</p> <p>Our start to the year, coupled with the leadership team that we now have in place, gives me unwavering confidence that our plan is working.\"</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Shake Shack's adjusted EBITDA margins remained roughly flat y/y at 14.0%, with adjusted EBITDA rising 20% y/y to $56.1 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1654\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"252\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"252\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack adjusted EBITDA <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is still facing headwinds from higher food costs, particularly in beef. On top of this, a rising mix of Shake Shack's sales are via delivery platforms, increasing commission payments. However, the company's labor model, plus its gradual tilting toward smaller formats (which are both cheaper to run on an ongoing basis and cost $2 million to build, a 20% y/y reduction in startup costs), have helped the company to offset the impacts of inflation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and key takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there are risks here that we need to keep in mind. As previously mentioned, McDonald's has been continuing to take more market share with positive U.S. comps in the second half of 2025, reflecting a consumer that is increasingly tilting to promotional deals. Though Shake Shack and McDonald's sit in different dining categories, we note that Shake Shack may feel more pressure to drive more promotions in order to appeal to a cash-strapped consumer. This is stacked on top of the risk of rising beef prices, which the company expects to continue inflating at a high single digit pace in 2026 (partially offset by lower paper and packaging costs).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I see more positives than risks in this stock, especially at a lower valuation multiple than most fast-casual peers and the strong signal from re-accelerating January same-shack sales. Stay long here.</p>",

Some investors pay a premium for a stock that behaves in such a predictable way, not that further increases will necessarily occur.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, past performance is one of the few available tools by which we can assess a company’s future performance. Based on this history, I would argue ExlService has an excellent management team that knows how to profitably grow a company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, it seems unlikely past performance chased away investors. The chart and history also suggest this is a Buy, not a Sell, stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Expectations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors also become bearish when they have dim expectations for future performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that likely is not the case here.

It is possible some investors may have bought Genpact and Maximus instead, but overall it seems unlikely to have contributed much to the slump.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The warning</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a red banner from the Quant system: “Warning: EXLS is at high risk of performing badly.” To that, it added the Quant system gives it a Sell rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quant system explained its reasons, “ExlService Holdings, Inc. has characteristics that have been historically associated with poor future stock performance. EXLS has decelerating momentum and declining growth when compared to other Industrials stocks, to the point that it gets a Sell rating from our Quant rating system.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, it is concerned about slowing momentum and declining growth—when compared to other Industrials stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Momentum is obviously a reflection of price movements, and for some time now, the movement has been down. But, if I am right in arguing the price will eventually catch up to earnings, momentum will reverse. Again, we do not know when.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second warning is for declining growth when compared with other Industrials stocks. But it takes only a quick look at other Seeking Alpha data to see that is not the case. On a current basis, EXLS beats the sector medians on all the metrics shown here and on others not shown:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2244\" data-height=\"916\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS growth table\" width=\"640\" height=\"261\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS growth table <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a five-year basis, it does lag the sector by most metrics shown here. Still, a scan shows us ExlService delivered double-digit growth across all these metrics, so while it may have lagged, its growth has been substantial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I’m not sure when the banner first appeared, it was likely on Monday, February 9, when the Quant system cut its rating from Hold to Sell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The price slump began before the warning and Sell rating were issued, and the price has changed only modestly since they came out. And while Seeking Alpha has a wide reach, it is not read by all investors. As a result, we can assume the warning has had little to do with falling prices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Institutional investors</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is possible the decline may have something to do with institutional investors. As the following Seeking Alpha table shows, the professionals own nearly 97% of outstanding shares:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2202\" data-height=\"514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS ownership table\" width=\"640\" height=\"149\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"149\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS ownership table <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/exls/institutional-holdings%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nasdaq</a> reported two of the biggest institutional funds, BlackRock, Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. trimmed their holdings in Q4-2025. BlackRock reduced its holding by 5.68% and Vanguard by 2.49%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Could they or other institutional investors have started cutting their holdings again in late January? It is possible, and somewhat likely, they did it in connection with the AI selloff. Or, since they move such large volumes, perhaps they started the AI slump.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That idea receives backing from the trading volumes. Over the past three months, the average volume has been about 1.5 million shares per day, but over the eight business days following February 2, six of those days had a volume of more than 3.5 million shares. One day had slightly over 3.0 million shares, and the eighth reached 2.9 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the institutional investors are selling, it does not necessarily mean fund managers are losing faith in ExlService. These managers buy and sell for many reasons, and not all of them have to do with a firm’s prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such a large increase in volume suggests institutions were making trades; no other category of owners is likely to move the market so much.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The AI slump </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In late January and early February, many prominent AI stocks, including those of Nvidia Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), experienced sharp pullbacks.

This weak performance from a major industry player appeared to validate broader market fears about the health of the IT services and consulting industry.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That story came out on the day ExlService fell 18.68%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At about the same time, ExlService and several of its peers/competitors dropped as well.

In particular, Verra, which appears unaffected on the chart, fell by more than a fifth, 21.50%, between January 9 and February 13.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on similarities between ExlService share prices and others in the AI sector, it seems likely the AI slump played a significant role in pulling down the price of not only ExlService but also those of its peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Is it a buy or a sell?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the fundamentals are strong, with the company delivering strong, steady growth over the past five years. In addition, the prospects for the next three years are strong, in the opinion of Wall Street analysts. They expect robust, double-digit earnings growth. And at those growth rates, ExlService should be known as an attractive compounder.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the slumping price, I expect it to recover, but do not know when (although it did reverse on February 26). What I do know is that there is a growing gap between the share price and earnings:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2628\" data-height=\"922\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS price-earnings-chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS price-earnings-chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaps such as this create opportunities for investors, especially value investors, because the share price likely will follow earnings, eventually. This will mean strong capital gains for existing shareholders when (or perhaps if) it happens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a previous article, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853696-exlservice-a-bond-substitute-for-bold-income-investors\">ExlService: A Bond Substitute For Bold Income Investors</a>, on December 16, 2025, I gave the company a Strong Buy based on its consistent growth, and the strength of its offerings in AI and data-driven services. I am maintaining that rating, and see no reason to change my one-year target price of $47.79.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the price has fallen significantly, it could drop even further. As we saw, it is expensive when compared with its peers, and it is quite possible buyers won’t outnumber sellers until there is P/E parity with Genpact and Maximus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quant system may be correct, and I may be wrong about the significance of the warnings. If that is the case, expect the ExlService price to drop even more in coming weeks or even quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s share price can be shaken by news, as was the case with Gartner’s disappointing earnings results. In this case, I suspect investors overreacted to the news, but they always have the last word.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an AI integrator, it faces many unknowns, both for its own operations and in what it does for its clients. Any failures could lead to reputational and financial harm.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The share price of ExlService Holdings has both wandered down and plunged for several weeks, apparently because of the AI slump and holding reductions by institutional investors. It further appears its fundamentals and investor expectations have not been factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI slump and institutional selloffs are likely transitory, and prices should rebound at some point. The fundamentals are robust, and expectations are high based on future EPS estimates.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the widening gap between the fundamentals and share price suggests an opportunity to buy a quality stock at an undervalued price.</p>",

If there's a theme emerging from these snapshots of the economy and financial markets, it's a generally upbeat one, featuring continued low inflation, moderate and improving<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> growth, and a gradual improvement in the fiscal outlook.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #1</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_079b357c5fc56fef9bf31fcb91b6affd.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"6- and 12-month growth rate of private sector jobs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_079b357c5fc56fef9bf31fcb91b6affd.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_079b357c5fc56fef9bf31fcb91b6affd.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #1 shows the 6- and 12-month growth rate of private sector jobs - the ones that really count. From a long-term perspective, it looks like the economy is growing at an unusually slow pace - barely a crawl. But considering the massive deportations of illegals and the virtual closure of our borders, it's not surprising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some will argue that this shows an economy hovering on the brink of \"stall speed,\" but I think that's an analogy that doesn't really apply to an economy. Economies have a strong tendency to grow if they are not burdened by abrupt and unforeseen changes in monetary and fiscal policy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, it is comforting to see that new claims for unemployment show absolutely no sign of any fundamental deterioration in the outlook for business profits. Firings are low and stable. The worst that can be said about jobs is that there aren't many new jobs being created. But that could be improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #2</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4780d8b4762cc72c85ba896959beb426.png?io=w640\" alt=\"monthly change in private sector jobs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4780d8b4762cc72c85ba896959beb426.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4780d8b4762cc72c85ba896959beb426.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #2 shows the monthly change in private sector jobs, which appears to have picked up in the past month. It's too early to claim victory after just one month of improvement, but some of the following charts also show recent improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #3</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e156860f78a1755e3ef06bdd1f39cf35.png?io=w640\" alt=\"monthly survey of purchasing managers\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"285\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e156860f78a1755e3ef06bdd1f39cf35.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e156860f78a1755e3ef06bdd1f39cf35.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #3 shows the results of a monthly survey of purchasing managers. It has shown pretty lackluster levels for the past several years, followed by an exceptionally strong January report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This could be the first sign of a long-expected surge in the outlook for business manufacturing activity. Historically, readings below 47 have frequently coincided with recessionary conditions. Readings north of 50 almost always occur during periods of decent economic growth. If the recent report is not reversed, then we could be on the verge of a very welcome growth spurt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #4</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7996fbfec6271e5ff4c6cdf8142ae7cf.png?io=w640\" alt=\"level of the federal government workforce\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"283\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7996fbfec6271e5ff4c6cdf8142ae7cf.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7996fbfec6271e5ff4c6cdf8142ae7cf.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #4 shows the level of the federal government workforce. The past year has been dominated by an astonishing 11% decline in the federal workforce - the by-product of Trump's aggressive attack on the Deep State, in particular the Dept. of Education.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the chart also shows, the federal workforce today is as small as it has been since 1966! There are now 324K fewer regulators of the economy. A small government workforce equates to a significant reduction in regulatory burdens, which are typically a cost that most businesses would be happy to avoid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This frees up resources for productive activity, and this is an unalloyed good thing. No one came close to predicting that the federal government workforce would ever decline by as much as it has in the past year. Note that the spikes in the data that occur every 10 years correspond to the temporary hiring of people needed to conduct the census.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #5</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a1e4a43ccc92e27a22c22fe158c46472.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index, compared to a version of the CPI that excludes shelter costs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"231\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a1e4a43ccc92e27a22c22fe158c46472.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a1e4a43ccc92e27a22c22fe158c46472.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #5 shows the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index, compared to a version of the CPI that excludes shelter costs (which make up about ⅓ of the CPI). The gap between the two that shows up in the past several years is the direct result of an overestimation by the BLS of shelter costs. That problem is now behind us, and we are left with inflation that is only moderately above 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #6</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_52f35f65631177ec186bb328ef22eda3.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"shelter costs (Owner's Equivalent Rent)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_52f35f65631177ec186bb328ef22eda3.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_52f35f65631177ec186bb328ef22eda3.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #6 focuses on shelter costs (which are called Owner's Equivalent Rent). This is what you would be paying if you had to rent the house you live in, and it is something that the BLS manufactures inside its computers, since nowhere does there exist such a thing in the real world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here we see that in the past month and past 3 months, the annualized change in this measure of shelter costs has fallen back - finally - to what it has tended to average in normal times. That explains why the gap between the two lines in Chart #5 has disappeared.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #7</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_affd6929d700bfade1b0ed3aa276f26b.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Housing prices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"399\" height=\"219\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_affd6929d700bfade1b0ed3aa276f26b.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_affd6929d700bfade1b0ed3aa276f26b.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #7 has been featured regularly on this blog for the past several years. It is designed to show that the BLS's calculation of shelter costs (OER) is highly correlated to the year-over-year change in housing prices (blue line) from 18 months prior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It took longer for OER to fall (given the prior decline in housing price inflation) than I thought, but the two lines are now back in sync at a level that is consistent with 2% overall inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I note further that national home prices rose only 1.2% last year, and, adjusted for inflation, they are 2.2% <em>below</em> their mid-2022 peak. Housing prices are thus quite likely to exert downward pressure on inflation in the months to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #8</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a0005772f0bf6b59cf6d65c71352f1a4.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"M2 growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a0005772f0bf6b59cf6d65c71352f1a4.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a0005772f0bf6b59cf6d65c71352f1a4.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #8 shows the year-over-year growth rate of the all-important M2 measure of the money supply. M2 rose on average by about 6% per year from 1995 through 2019, a period during which the CPI rose by 2% or less per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More recently, M2 growth in the year ending January '26 was a mere 3.6%. In normal, pre-Covid times, most economists would predict that 3.6% M2 growth would lead to a slowdown in economic growth and a decline in inflation. Yet today the chatter is all about whether inflation is going to rise. This could be one of those times when the market is caught looking in the wrong direction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #9</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_791202bd0020d56980c2f5f0166c9972.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"2 divided by nominal GDP\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_791202bd0020d56980c2f5f0166c9972.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_791202bd0020d56980c2f5f0166c9972.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #9 shows what I consider to be a good measure of money demand: M2 divided by nominal GDP. This effectively measures how much of our annual income we like to hold in the form of readily spendable money (currency, checking accounts, retail money market funds, etc.).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Money demand today is pretty much the same as it was prior to COVID. The Covid years were characterized initially by a gigantic increase in the demand for money, which was then followed by a return or \"normal\" levels. My interpretation of all this is that monetary conditions are just about right: money supply is matched by money demand, and that equates to the absence of monetary imbalances that might fuel higher inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #10</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e9884dc1b5d240be38f572d3f0f473b0.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"the strength or weakness of the dollar\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e9884dc1b5d240be38f572d3f0f473b0.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e9884dc1b5d240be38f572d3f0f473b0.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #10 compares the strength or weakness of the dollar (a rising blue line equates to a weaker dollar, while a declining blue line equates to a stronger dollar) with the inflation-adjusted level of a basket of basic commodity prices. Note the very strong correlation of these two variables over time - except for the period following the Covid crisis, when supply chains were disrupted but the consumers wanted to ramp up their spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodity prices back then were much stronger than the strength of the dollar would have predicted, and they helped fuel rising inflation. Recently, however, the two variables have come back into line with each other. Commodity prices are no longer \"too strong,\" while the dollar is still reasonably strong itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Commodity prices are not a source of inflation these days. Need I add that gasoline prices today are very close to their 20-year average ($2.88/gallon), and that they have fallen almost 40% from their 2022 high? Moreover, crude oil prices today are actually almost 10% <em>lower</em> than their 20-year average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #11</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7a627f665cc25015b7392d30acb593fc.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"level of real GDP growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7a627f665cc25015b7392d30acb593fc.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7a627f665cc25015b7392d30acb593fc.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #11 shows the level of real GDP growth as it compares to two different trend lines (it's important to note the use of a log scale on the y-axis, which makes it easy to see growth trends).

Today that burden is significantly less than it was during the 1980s, mainly because interest rates are far lower than they were back then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Congress exercises even modest restraint and the Fed doesn't have to raise interest rates (which they won't have to if inflation remains under control), then we can gradually reduce our deficits and the burden of our debt.

The company currently has seven approved and marketed products (five of which are out-licensed) and is advancing 11 late-stage clinical programs. Ionis was formed in 1989 and went public in 1991, with its first trade transacted at $10.75 a share. Its stock trades around $81.00 a share, translating to an approximate market cap of just north of $13 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Products</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many of the company’s products and clinical programs are antisense therapies, which entail the creation of short, non-coded synthetic strands of DNA (antisense oligonucleotides) that are capable of binding to messenger RNA to influence gene expression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723\" alt=\"Wholly Owned Medicines\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1772031723 1280w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1772031723 1080w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1772031723 750w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723 640w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1772031723 480w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1772031723 320w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1772031723 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>February 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Tryngolza</em>. Of its seven marketed products, the first one that the company is selling on its own in its 37-year history and most germane to the its future success is Tryngolza (olezarsen), a once monthly, self-administered, subcutaneously injected ligand-conjugated antisense (LICA) therapy as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare, genetic disease caused by impaired function of the lipoprotein lipase enzyme, prompting extremely elevated triglycerides (10 to 100 times normal). Designed to lower triglycerides by reducing the body’s production of protein APOC-3, Tryngolza is anticipated to also receive approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG), a condition characterized by triglyceride levels above 500 mg/dL, which is associated with potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP – sudden inflammation of the pancreas). In two Phase 3 studies (CORE, CORE2), olezarsen demonstrated placebo-adjusted triglyceride level reductions of 55% and 72% at six months (both p&lt;0.001) and pooled data showed an 85% lowering of AP events after a year on therapy (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, 54% of patients on high dose (80mg) olezarsen achieved normal triglyceride levels (&lt;150 mg/dL).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those results should make Tryngolza the new standard of care for sHTG upon approval, likely forthcoming in 2H26. The market recognized these data when they were announced in early September 2025, rallying shares of IONS 35% to $57.49 in the subsequent trading session. Already off to an excellent start treating FCS (domestic population of ~3,000) with sales of $105 million during its first year on the market and patent protected until 2034, management now believes its triglyceride-lowering therapy should generate peak sales north of $2 billion, up from &gt;$1 billion prior to its results against sHTG, an indication with a population of approximately three million Americans. For sHTG, active agent olezarsen has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Olezarsen\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"302\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>November 2025 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that <strong>Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARWR\" title=\"Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">ARWR</a>)</strong> received approval for its RNA interference therapy Redemplo (plozasiran) treating FCS in November 2025 and is evaluating it in a pivotal trial (SHASTA-3) for the treatment of sHTG, which should readout in 3Q26. Also pursuing this indication in the clinic are 89bio’s FGF21 analog pegozafermin (Phase 3) and NorthSea Therapeutics’ oral CETP inhibitor NST-1024 (Phase 2).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Dawnzera</em>. Ionis’ other recently approved therapy is Dawnzera (donidalorsen), a once-monthly subcutaneous injection of prekallikrein-directed antisense oligonucleotide that was sanctioned by the FDA for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema [HAE] in patients 12 years or older in August 2025 and on January 21, 2026 in the EU. HAE is a rare, chronic, and potentially life-threatening condition caused by deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor protein. It is characterized by recurrent attacks of severe swelling, typically in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and airway, afflicting ~7,000 Americans. Approval was secured after Dawnzera reduced the HAE attack rate by 81% compared to placebo over 24 weeks. With three-quarters of patients currently treated with long-term prophylaxes and 90% interested in a new approach, management envisions peak annual sales potential for its HAE treatment at more than $500 million.

Spinraza was approved in 2016 and has generated royalty revenue between $200 million and $250 million since FY22 after peaking at $293.0 million in FY19. Wainua was approved for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTRv-PN) in 2023, generating royalty revenue of $33.1 million in the first nine months of 2025 (YTD25). More importantly, it is under Phase 3 evaluation (CARDIO-TTRansform) for ATTR-CM (cardiomyopathy), a patient population of 300K to 500K worldwide (versus 10K to 40K globally for ATTRv-PN), and an ~$8 billion domestic market. Data on 1,400+ patients from the pivotal trial are anticipated in 2H26.

Competition won’t be an issue if Ionis receives approval for zilganersen, an RNA-targeted therapy designed to inhibit the production of glial fibrillary acidic protein for the treatment of Alexander disease (AxD). The progressive and ultimately fatal ultra-rare condition that affects the brain’s white matter is characterized by a loss of muscle control and death within 14 to 25 years post symptom onset. After achieving its primary endpoint of change in 10-meter walk time versus placebo (p=0.0412), Ionis anticipates filing an NDA in 1Q26. Zilganersen has received Orphan Drug designations from the FDA and EU, as well as Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in the U.S. Management places its peak sales potential at north of $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>ION582</em>. Another wholly owned neurological candidate of note is ION582, a once-every-12-week RNA-targeted therapy designed to inhibit UBE3A antisense transcript expression, thus increasing the production of UBE3A protein for the treatment of Angelman syndrome, a disease characterized by intellectual disability, balance issues, motor impairment, and seizures that present at infancy. Afflicting ~100,000 in major geographies, there are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies. After demonstrating a 97% response rate as defined by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-4 (Bayley-4) at 18 months in a Phase 1/2 trial (HALOS), ION582 is undergoing evaluation in a 158-patient Phase 3 study (REVEAL) with the primary endpoint change in performance of the expressive communication subdomain raw score of Bayley-4. If eventually approved for Angelman, management believes ION582 can achieve blockbuster status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Out-Licensed and Share Pipeline</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to zilganersen, ION582, and five other wholly owned clinical programs, Ionis has 12 out-licensed assets that are undergoing clinical evaluation, not including the aforementioned Wainua. The most advanced candidates are <strong>GlaxoSmithKline’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSK\" title=\"GSK plc\">GSK</a>)</strong> chronic hepatitis B med bepirovirsen, for which a 1Q26 filing is anticipated, and <strong>Novartis’ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>)</strong> elevated lipoprotein(a)-driven cardiovascular disease treatment pelacarsen, which could launch in 2027. Between these two candidates and Wainua in ATTR-CM, Ionis projects peak annual royalty revenue of more than $1.6 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3Q25 Financials &amp; Revised Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Owing to the fact that it is still early days for wholly owned products Tryngolza and Dawnzera, the company is not near breaking even as it advances eight clinical programs, including its co-development deal for Wainua. That said, management believes it will achieve cash-flow breakeven in 2028. That outlook was provided as part of its 3Q25 financial report on October 29, 2025, when it posted a loss of $0.61 per share (non-GAAP) on revenue of $156.7 million versus a loss of $0.72 per share on revenue of $133.8 million in 3Q24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top line was $26.5 million better than expectations, prompting Ionis to raise its FY25 revenue outlook by $50 million to $887.5 million, based on range midpoints.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4Q25 Financials:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723\" alt=\"FY2025 Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1772031723 1280w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1772031723 1080w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1772031723 750w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723 640w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1772031723 480w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1772031723 320w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1772031723 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>February 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ionis Pharmaceuticals posted its fourth-quarter <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556581-ionis-pharmaceuticals-gaap-eps-of-1_41-misses-by-0_09-revenue-of-203m-beats-by-46_87m\"><strong>results</strong></a> Wednesday.

The product did $108 million in sales in FY2025, its first year on the market. Dawnzera did $7 million in sales in its first full quarter on the market. Spinraza had global sales of $356 million in Q4, generating royalty revenue of $54 million for Ionis. This was down from $64 million in the same period a year ago. Overall, royalty revenue came in at $76 million, down $1 million from 4Q2024. Commercial revenues (not including various milestones/other payments) rose 49% to $436 million in the 2025 fiscal year.

On average, they <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IONS/earnings/estimates\"><strong>expect</strong></a> the company to achieve profitability in FY28, when it earns $1.90 on revenue of $1.88 billion. The bottom line should accelerate rapidly from there, with Ionis generating $8.79 per share on revenue of $4.04 billion in FY31.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Verdict:</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With two wholly owned products, five (essentially) out-licensed products, seven wholly owned clinical programs, 11 out-licensed clinical programs, and one co-development program, Ionis is an extremely active concern. Management estimates that from these 26 opportunities, it possesses annual peak revenue potential greater than $4 billion—thanks in large measure to the Tryngolza data in sHTG—annual peak royalty potential greater than $2 billion, and potential milestones totaling north of $6 billion. That said, shares of IONS are up over 80% since data from Tryngolza in September 2025 compelled management to raise its peak revenue estimate by $1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723\" alt=\"2026 Ionis Milestones\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1772031723 1280w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1772031723 1080w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1772031723 750w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723 640w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1772031723 480w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1772031723 320w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1772031723 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>February 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, there are risks to the narrative—most notably, if once-monthly injectable Wainua cannot best oral offerings from <strong>Pfizer’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>)</strong> Vyndamax (tafamidis) or <strong>BridgeBio’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\" title=\"BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.\">BBIO</a>)</strong> recently approved Attruby (Acoramidis) or Alnylam’s (ANLY) injectable RNA interference therapy Amvuttra (vutrisiran) in CARDIO-TTRansform. Furthermore, data from a Phase 3 study could compel partner AstraZeneca to prioritize its wholly owned IgG1-targeting monoclonal antibody ALXN2220 over Wainua for ATTR-CM. Lastly, <strong>Intellia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTLA\" title=\"Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.\">NTLA</a>)</strong> and <strong>Regeneron’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REGN\" title=\"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">REGN</a>)</strong> Phase 3 CRISPR therapeutic candidate NTLA-2001 could also alter the treatment landscape.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, even with the recent run and the potential risks to its story, its vast wholly owned and partnered pipeline of opportunities—as well as de-risked upside for Tryngolza—should allow shares of IONS to continue their grind higher over time. After its big rally, IONS doesn't merit a large position. However, when partnered with solid premiums in its options, Ionis is a decent <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>covered call</strong></a> candidate. That is my way of saying, I don't mind accumulating a stake in IONS. I just want to do so at a lower entry point after the shares recent rally.</p>",
