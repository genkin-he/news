Alphabet’s business continues to grow at an aggressive rate, the company remains a dominant force in the search market, and its cloud offerings reached new records in Q4 thanks to the rising demand for computing power. While the market is questioning the company’s massive capital spending plans to expand its AI capabilities, I view the recent depreciation of the stock as a buying opportunity since Alphabet has plenty of resources to weather any incoming crisis and thrive in the years to come.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The AI Trade Isn’t Ending Anytime Soon</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s Q4 earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547421-alphabet-gaap-eps-of-2_82-beats-by-0_18-revenue-of-113_82b-beats-by-2_34b\">report</a> was certainly good, given that its revenues increased by 17.9% Y/Y to $113.82 billion and were above the estimates by over $2 billion. As expected, the search business continues to be one of the main drivers of growth as its <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenues</a> during the quarter were $63.08 billion, up from $54.03 billion a year ago. With a nearly 90% <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">share</a> of the global search engine market, Alphabet will likely continue to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the <a href=\"https://mediabrief.com/global-advertising-spend-to-reach-1-3tn-in-2026-up-9-1-warc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising</a> ad spending within the global advertising market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, as users pivot to AI chatbots and AI-powered search engines, Alphabet has everything going for it to also benefit from this development. During the earnings call, Alphabet’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866108-alphabet-inc-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> that their AI Overviews product, which has been integrated into Google’s search engine, is performing well, while another product, AI Mode, has experienced a rise in daily queries in the United States. It was also stated that users are now engaging in longer sessions on AI Mode, which indicates that the fears of Alphabet falling behind in the AI race were overblown. In addition to that, the Gemini chatbot itself has recently reached over 750 million MAUs, experienced a rise in engagement, and <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/corp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/attachment-Global-AI-Tracker-6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">started</a> to gain market share at a time when OpenAI’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) ChatGPT experienced a decline in traffic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With $126.84 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/balance-sheet\">cash</a> reserves and only $66.99 billion in total debt, Alphabet is also positioned best to weather any incoming crisis. For comparison, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI generated</a> only $13 billion in revenue in 2025 and remained unprofitable. Given that it plans to spend significant sums of money to expand its computing power even more in the following years, its unprofitability could become a major issue if it overstretches its resources. Alphabet doesn’t face such an issue thanks to the booming search business and a solid balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s also important to mention is that Alphabet’s solid foothold in the cloud business also helps the company to benefit from the growth of its competitors. It was reported that Alphabet is providing computing power to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553201-anthropic-may-share-up-to-64b-with-amazon-google-microsoft-in-2027\">Anthropic</a>, both of which are its rivals in the chatbot business. Thanks to the impressive demand for the computing power caused by the ongoing generative AI revolution, Alphabet’s cloud business was able to increase its revenues by 48% Y/Y to $17.66 billion in Q4 and will likely continue to grow in the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering all of this, it’s safe to assume that the AI trade is not ending anytime soon, and Alphabet still has room for growth. Given its performance in Q4, it’s not a surprise that the company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/revisions\">received</a> 50 upward revenue revisions and 0 downward revenue revisions in recent months. With the amount of growth opportunities that Alphabet has going for it, it makes sense to say that the company has the potential to create additional shareholder value in the months to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What’s Next For Alphabet’s Shares?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the great performance in Q4 and the improved outlook for 2026, it’s safe to assume that Alphabet’s shares remain an attractive investment in the current environment. Before the release of the Q4 results, my discounted cash flow model showed that the company’s fair value is $360.65 per share. Considering that we recently got fresh numbers for the latest quarter, it makes sense to update that model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the beginning of this month, I assumed that Alphabet’s revenue growth rate in FY25 and beyond would be 15%. Thanks to the great performance in Q4, the annual revenue growth rate was 15.1%, while the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\">consensus</a> now is that in FY26 the growth rate will be 16.75%. Considering this, I have also increased my revenue assumptions from 15% to 17% for FY26. In all the other years, the growth rate is now in the range of 16% to 17%, as there’s a potential for Alphabet to continue to scale its business given its competitive advantages against others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The EBIT in FY25 grew less than I expected. As such, the assumptions for the EBIT margin have been slightly decreased. The tax rate in FY26 and beyond is the average rate of the last three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the capital expenditures, they are expected to significantly increase in 2026. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866108-alphabet-inc-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Alphabet now expects</a> its CapEx this year to be in the range of $175 billion and $185 billion. This has been reflected in the model as well. At the same time, the company noted during the latest earnings call that the depreciation is going to meaningfully increase later this year due to the increase in CapEx investments. Therefore, my assumptions for the depreciation and amortization in the model have also been meaningfully increased. The assumptions for the change in net working capital in the updated model didn’t change significantly in comparison to the last model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1652\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alphabet's DCF Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Alphabet's DCF Model <span>(Historical Data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under the updated assumptions, my DCF model shows that Alphabet’s fair value is $388.68 per share, which is slightly above the previous expectations and above the current market price. While the CapEx assumptions have been increased significantly and the EBIT margin was lowered, the greater expectations for the revenue growth, along with the meaningfully higher D&amp;A estimates, resulted in a higher fair value following the successful Q4 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327296792257_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1290\" data-height=\"294\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327296792257_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alphabet's DCF Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"146\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327296792257_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327296792257_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327296792257_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327296792257_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Alphabet's DCF Model <span>(Historical Data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Some Risks To Consider</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I’ve already noted earlier in the article, Alphabet is positioned well to weather any incoming crisis. However, during any type of crisis, the company’s shares could nevertheless experience a major depreciation in the short to near term as investors trim their positions in times of uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the rise in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-14/ai-bubble-fears-are-creating-new-derivatives-credit-weekly\" rel=\"nofollow\">fears</a> of the potential AI bubble collapse, stocks of major tech companies like Alphabet were not able to appreciate in value in the last month despite reporting solid earnings results. Investors are currently questioning the massive commitments by the firms to increase their capital expenditures in order to expand their AI capabilities. After all, there’s no guarantee that those AI investments will yield significant <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">returns</a>. The fact that Alphabet’s CapEx is expected to increase from $91.45 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/cash-flow-statement\">2025</a> to between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026 is one of the main reasons why the company’s stock failed to appreciate despite the major growth that the underlying business has shown in Q4. There’s a risk that the stock price fails to grow in the foreseeable future if the spending on AI gets out of control, as it could prompt investors to look for safer investments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite all of those risks, I believe that Alphabet will be able to thrive in the long run, even if it overspends on AI, and some of the spending will go to waste. This is because the company remains a solid force in the search and cloud markets, and its business is unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon, especially following the antitrust ruling that was discussed in detail in my last article on the company. More importantly, the company’s strong balance sheet should help Alphabet weather any incoming crisis, while the latest upbeat outlook for 2026 gives reasons to be optimistic about the business’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Because of that, Alphabet remains an attractive investment to me, especially at the current price.</p>",

The paradoxical aspect was that this was occurring<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in the first year of the Trump presidency. The rationale was based upon three main pillars: monetary easing that would decrease the cost of borrowing for capital-intensive renewable energy companies, the growing demand for clean energy driven by AI that would provide a long-term tailwind for clean energy companies, and a relatively attractive valuation discount compared to the broader market as well as the US Energy sector.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recommendation was a BUY with a cautionary note regarding emerging regulatory headwinds.

The fund is diversified in terms of geographic exposure with the largest region being the US. It is meant to track the performance of the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Transition Index, which consists of around 100 companies with at least $300 million in market cap, $100 million in float adjusted market cap and $3 million median value traded over a six-month horizon. Since the writing of the initial article, ICLN has continued to build on its momentum in a substantive way. The fund’s assets under management have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICLN/liquidity\">reflected</a> this with its growth from $1.56 billion to over $2.23 billion up until mid-February of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grading-wise, the fund has maintained or improved its grades as per the Seeking Alpha grading system. Improving in categories such as Risk and Momentum. Regarding the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICLN/risk\">Risk</a> category, ICLN has top tier Tracking Error, drastically lower than the median ETF. Liquidity is high, with over $70 million traded daily over a 3- month time range. The fund is characterized with an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICLN/dividends/scorecard\">B Dividends Grade</a> mainly for its long track record of dividend payments being 17 years and its solid dividend growth rate in the past 3 and 5 years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Policy Headwinds: Clean Energy Loan Rollback, Endangerment Finding Repeal</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the former recommendation has stood the test of time in terms of performance, the regulatory landscape has evolved significantly since then, and two significant events require attention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January 2026, the United States Department of Energy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4541934-trump-administration-revising-or-scrapping-over-83b-in-clean-energy-loans\">revealed</a> that its Office of Energy Dominance Financing, the renamed successor to the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment under the previous Biden Administration, is restructuring, revising, or eliminating over $83 billion in clean energy loans and conditional loan commitments made by the previous administration. Out of the total principal loan obligations of $104 billion under the previous administration's policies, about $30 billion is being outright de-obligated, while a further $53 billion is currently under revision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a significant move with substantial implications. Out of the total loan commitments being revised or eliminated, about $9.5 billion specifically for wind and solar projects has been eliminated and redirected to natural gas and nuclear energy. The office has also signified a clear strategic shift with its <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/edf/articles/letter-leadership-edf-2025-year-review-and-looking-forward-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">new priorities</a> comprising nuclear, coal, oil, gas, critical minerals, geothermal, and grid infrastructure, with solar and wind being suspiciously removed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a significant reduction in the level of funding support that the government provides to the exact type of projects that many of ICLN’s constituents rely upon for project development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it should be noted that the diversification of ICLN’s constituents also reduces the overall impact of the policy change. While the United States is the largest position in the fund, it is not the only one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"817\" data-height=\"323\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ETFDb</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund also has large allocations to China and Brazil, among others. Therefore, the fund is not necessarily trapped to the policies that the government in the United States dictates. The international constituents, in particular the European utilities, operate in a completely different environment and are actually <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2586\" rel=\"nofollow\">moving forward</a> with clean energy development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps more impactful was the February 12, 2026 <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">announcement</a> by the Trump administration of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552175-trump-reverses-landmark-endangerment-finding-in-major-blow-to-climate-regulations\">repeal</a> of the 2009 Endangerment Finding by the Environmental Protection Agency, which states that greenhouse gases present a threat to the health and welfare of the public and had been the foundation for all U.S. federal climate regulations for almost 20 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-epa-endangerment-finding-greenhouse-gases-climate-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> called</a> the repeal \"the single largest deregulatory act in the history of the United States.\" It repeals the legal foundation for setting greenhouse gas emissions standards on vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas facilities, and also strips the EPA of legal authority, according to the administration, to regulate greenhouse gases at all, under the Clean Air Act.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The practical effects of this change are substantial. Vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards, which was one of the largest motivating factors for the adoption of EVs in the first place, has been de facto eliminated. The power plant and industrial emissions standards that came out of the Endangerment Finding are equally at risk of being legally challenged or administratively changed. From the perspective of clean energy companies, the effect of this change has been the elimination of a regulatory structure that has been pushing utilities and automakers to new sources of renewable energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Environmental and health groups have already sued the EPA over this change. The process will be long, and it's entirely possible that much of the regulatory structure will be put back in place. However, the uncertainty of this for the near future cannot be dismissed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a valuation standpoint, the fund boasts a 17.52x P/E, rising from 14.75x at the point in time the original article was made. Relative attractiveness to the broader U.S. market is still present, with it trading at around <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/\" rel=\"nofollow\">27.76x</a> P/E. The same is true regarding the comparison to the U.S. Energy sector as a whole, with the fund trading at a discount compared to the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IYE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">21.73x</a> P/E of the energy sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-1772141317680681.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"453\" height=\"214\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-1772141317680681.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-1772141317680681.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, Author Compiled</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top 10 constituents don’t offer the same compelling picture they did in the original article, with them trading at higher P/E ratios both in absolute and relative terms compared to their 5-year average.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rating Downgrade</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The original BUY rating for ICLN was given with particular diligence regarding the regulatory environment. This risk has since materialized with two of the most important regulations. The $83 billion loan rollback and the repeal of the Endangerment Finding represent a deliberate and strategic attempt to shift the course of domestic energy policy away from renewables and towards fossil fuels and nuclear energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the long-term investment thesis of the original rating has not been disconfirmed. The AI-driven energy demand supercycle continues to play out. Goldman Sachs' <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/is-nuclear-energy-the-answer-to-ai-data-centers-power-consumption\" rel=\"nofollow\">projection</a> of 40% of additional power demand being met by renewables has not been disproven. The monetary environment has continued to soften globally, which has eased pressure on the highly leveraged balance sheets of renewables-focused companies. This is evidenced by the declining interest expenses for companies like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE/income-statement\">Bloom Energy</a>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE\" title=\"Bloom Energy Corporation\">BE</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NXT/income-statement\">Nextpower Inc</a>.(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NXT\" title=\"Nextpower Inc.\">NXT</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ICLN’s international exposure offers some diversification from domestic policy shifts. The valuation of the fund, while no longer as attractively priced as it was during the publication of the original article, remains reasonable by comparison to the overall market and the energy sector specifically.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk profile has deteriorated on the policy front and after a rally of more than 50% on a yearly basis, the entry point has become less attractive. The tailwinds of the easing cycle have become more and more priced in and the legal uncertainty even if the courts grant a repeal regarding the Endangerment Finding, in my opinion, will still weigh on sentiment. Consequently, I downgrade my rating to HOLD.</p>",

The main growth driver for the Q4 quarter was GCT's accelerating transition toward a third-party (3P) marketplace model: by the end of Q4 2025, the 3P sellers accounted for ~54.0% of total marketplace GMV, and in absolute amounts, the growth looks stunning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1240\" data-height=\"669\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those 3P participants are bringing in higher-margin revenues for GCT, so the very trend of GCT switching from a capital-intensive 1P retailer into a high-margin platform looks healthy, promising a better recurring revenue stream with lower inventory risk for 2026-2028 (at least).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a single quarter, GCT added 670 customers in its GigaCloud Marketplace (+5.8% QoQ or +29.9% YoY), and when we look at unit economics, we see that the spend-per-customer is on the rise as well. For example, per the IR materials, those customers who joined in FY2024 have increased spending from $86 million (in Q4 FY2024) to ~$99 million in Q4 FY2025, which is a YoY growth of ~15.11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1312\" data-height=\"695\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The area of my interest in the past was GCT's scaling in Europe - I thought that this new market for the firm would make it possible to offset the weakness caused by the US‑China trade war. Indeed, the U.S. market showed relative softness in Q4, but my assumption from the past played out well, as GigaCloud saw its European revenues surge by 68% YoY in Q4. The company has expanded its infrastructure in Europe to seven facilities, with 6 of these facilities being in Germany. The management wants to explore the UK now after the success in Germany - they're already operating a fulfillment center and a port of destination there, so once they add another node, it's going to accelerate their non-US business expansion and lead to abnormal growth rates ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GCT is also quite active in M&amp;As, and I think they're doing a good job turning their targets around. For example, they turned Noble House, once a bankrupt entity losing about $40 million per year, into a profitable branch that showed 40% revenue growth in Q4. I expect that their new purchase - New Classic Home Furnishings, which they bought for $18 million cash - will get integrated throughout 2026 and add tremendous value. As the management described it, New Classic Home Furnishings is \"a traditional distributor with deep roots in brick-and-mortar retail and &gt;1,000 retail partners\", so this customer base might drive another round of massive growth for the GigaCloud technology platform this year, thanks to the omnichannel experience GCT is about to go through. At least that's how I view it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I like about GCT is that the management doesn't just reinvest the FCF they get into a bunch of new M&amp;A targets or facilities - they're actually returning a lot of value to shareholders through repurchases. They've already executed about $33 million of the $111 million share repurchase program they authorized in August 2025, helping the stock reprice higher. Given that the program is far from being completed, and considering the consensus-beating potential (and the resulting rise in investors' interest in the stock), GCT is likely to keep enjoying the current rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What supports the above finding of mine is GCT's valuation. Yes, there was some multiple expansion, but on a forward basis, GCT is still trading at less than 10x earnings:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On most metrics available for comparison to the consumer discretionary sector, we see that GCT looks 15-50% undervalued:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"973\" data-height=\"753\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha, GCT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"495\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, GCT</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw how GCT was able to deliver 30%+ YoY growth in GAAP EPS in Q4 2025, but the only analyst who covers the stock still projects the firm to grow its earnings by just 11.42% and 6.5% YoY in FY2026 and FY2027, respectively:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1490\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha, GCT's EPS consensus\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, GCT's EPS consensus</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think GCT is capable of showing more than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming a 20% YoY EPS growth for FY2026 and a forecast of 10% for FY2027, I think that GCT should trade at 12-14x earnings within the next 12 months (partially thanks to buybacks that artificially push the multiples higher). With that in mind, I have an FY2026 EPS of ~$4.25 and a midrange P/E exit ratio of 13x, and all this leads to a price target of $55.25/share. That's an upside potential of ~17.6% to the post-Q4 stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some risks that every investor should keep in mind when considering GCT as a potential buy. First, despite the diversification efforts we've seen over the past quarters, GigaCloud's model still heavily relies on connecting manufacturers in Asia with Western markets, so it's very sensitive to any trade war escalations. Second, over the past 6 months, CEO Lei Wu and COO Xinyan Hao <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/gigacloud-technology-nasdaqgct-shares-gap-up-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2026-02-26/\" rel=\"noopener\">have executed numerous share sales</a>, and while these transactions were largely executed under pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, there's a risk that if they keep doing so, the rise in supply of insider shares can create a technical ceiling for the stock price shortly. Third, assuming that GCT keeps trading at 10x and the current FY2026 EPS consensus estimate is spot on, my price target would drop to just $40/share. The current stock price would become overvalued by almost 15%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I admit that GCT carries major risks for consideration and that the firm's GMV won't be rising by 50-70% annually indefinitely, I think that for the rest of 2026 and likely 2027, the stock still looks quite tempting (even after the post-Q4 surge). I actually liked the Q4 result, and I'm expecting some positive revisions to kick in shortly. As I see an undervaluation of 17-18%, I decided to keep my \"Buy\" rating unchanged for now.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Thank you for reading!</em></p>",

Indeed, HSBC was valued at a bottom P/BV multiple of only 0.4x back in 2020 and less than book value at the end of 2024, showing that its strong share price performance over the last year was largely due to a re-rating of its shares rather than earnings or book value growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Indeed, the bank has recently released its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556382-hsbc-holdings-misses-q4-estimates-bank-increases-dividend\">earnings related to 2025</a>, which showed a positive operating performance, but that was not that impressive that justifies a very strong re-rating of its shares, in my opinion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Its reported revenues amounted to $68.3 billion during last year, up by just 4% YoY, supported by higher net interest income and fee growth. On the other hand, its revenues were impacted by business disposals performed during 2024, namely in Argentina and Canada, plus the dilution of its stake in </span>BOCOM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCMXY\" title=\"Bank of Communications Co., Ltd.\">BCMXY</a>) following a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4426737-china-to-inject-69b-into-state-banks-to-strengthen-capital-reserves\">capital increase</a> last June also had a negative effect on HSBC’s revenue. These items impacted HSBC’s revenues by close to $2 billion in 2025, while adjusted for these impacts, its revenues would have been around $71 billion last year, up by 5% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While its top-line growth was not fantastic, this can be considered a positive outcome as there were some headwinds from lower USD rates, which were offset by the bank’s loan growth, higher income from the structural hedge portfolio, and higher fees in the Wealth and Wholesale Transactions Banking segments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Its banking NII was practically flat compared to the previous year at about $44 billion, representing some 64% of the bank’s total revenues, as lower rates impacted income. For 2026, the bank’s guidance is to report NII of at least $45 billion, representing an annual increase of about 2.2% supported by deposit growth and the structural hedge income, while rates are expected to be lower ahead compared to the level at the end of 2025.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This means most of its revenue pool is expected to grow at very low single digits ahead, while on the other hand, fee income has reported a much better performance over the past few quarters and is likely to remain the major top-line growth engine in the near future.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Fee and other income amounted to nearly $27 billion in 2025, representing an annual increase of close to $3.5 billion and were up by 15% YoY. This very good performance was largely supported by the Wealth segment that reported annual revenues of $9.4 billion, up by 24% YoY, driven by insurance, private banking, asset management, and investment distribution that benefited from higher valuations on the capital markets and organic growth across several business segments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"823\" data-height=\"587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fee income pool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fee income <span>(HSBC)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The bank expects to increase annual revenues by low single digits over the next couple of years and reach annual revenue growth of about 5% by 2028, before notable items, showing that HSBC’s growth prospects aren’t impressive over the next few years. Investors should also be aware that its reported revenue growth may be weaker than that over the coming years, as the bank continues to restructure its business and is actively pursuing further divestments of non-core units, such as the retail banking activities in Australia, Indonesia, and Egypt that can be divested in the short to medium term, and its Singapore life insurance business in a deal that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557858-hsbc-looks-to-sell-singapore-life-insurance-manufacturing-unit-in-over-1b-deal---report\">could be valued</a> at over $1 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding costs, the bank reported annual expenses of $36.4 billion during the last year, representing an increase of 10% compared to 2024. This figure includes some one-off items, such as $1.4 billion in litigation costs related to Madoff funds and Europe operations, and about $2 billion related to restructuring, asset disposals, and acquisition costs. Adjusted for this effect, its cost base was around $33.5 billion, representing an increase of 3% YoY, which is an acceptable development considering the inflation levels across its most important markets and the bank’s investments in technology. Considering its adjusted costs, HSBC’s cost-to-income ratio, a key measure of efficiency in the banking sector, was 49% during last year, being an acceptable level for a large bank like HSBC.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite that, the bank has some cost reduction measures ongoing targeting to save about $1.5 billion of annual expenses by 2027, and the recent full consolidation of Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong is also expected to reach annual savings of about $600 million by 2028. However, to achieve these savings, the bank needs to reduce headcount, which has a negative effect in the short term regarding reported operating expenses due to severance costs, while the full-cost savings are only reflected in future financial years. Therefore, while HSBC has some significant cost reductions planned over the next couple of years, its cost base is likely to increase in 2026 with the bank expecting to report an increase of 1% excluding notable items.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding asset quality, there were some concerns about potential losses related to commercial real estate (CRE) both in Hong Kong and mainland China, but HSBC’s provisions for loan losses amounted to $3.9 billion in 2025, up by just $400 million compared to 2024. Its cost of risk ratio was 39 basis points (bps), which is still within its target range of 30-40 bps over the medium term. There were indeed higher losses related to CRE in Hong Kong during the year, of about $700 million compared to $100 million in 2024, but this seems to be manageable and doesn’t put the bank’s earnings and future profit potential at risk, in my opinion. Indeed, HSBC’s guidance is to have a cost of risk ratio around 40 bps in 2026, showing that the bank is not expecting much credit deterioration ahead, and provisions for loan losses are likely to remain at similar levels to previous years over the medium term.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"893\" data-height=\"586\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart of cost of risk ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Provisions for loan losses <span>(HSBC)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Considering this combination of modest revenue growth, higher costs due to notable items, and slightly higher provisions for loan losses, its reported net profit amounted to $23.1 billion in 2025, down by 7% YoY. Excluding one-off items, its adjusted net profit was close to $30 billion, up by 11% from the previous year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While adjusted figures show a much better performance than its reported bottom line, and HSBC likes to highlight that in its presentations, I think investors should use adjusted figures with some caution, as the bank has consistently had one-off items (what the bank calls notable items) over the past few years. Between restructuring costs, litigation, and losses on asset sales, HSBC’s reported and adjusted figures are consistently different on an annual basis, and this trend is likely to continue ahead, as the bank is performing restructuring efforts in several units and is likely to continue to do asset sales, making notable items a recurring thing in its financial statements.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While this doesn’t change the bank’s investment case in my opinion, it’s something that investors should be aware of, especially considering that HSBC’s financial targets exclude notable items and give a much better picture regarding its profitability than compared to reported figures.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Indeed, its return on tangible equity (RoTE) was 13.3% in 2025 (vs. 14.6% in 2024), while excluding notable items, it was 17.2%. This is a significant difference, and investors could assume that HSBC would easily achieve a reported RoTE above 17% over the next few years as the bank aims to, but I’m skeptical that its reported RoTE will be close to 17% in the near term, as notable items are likely to remain significant over the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding its capital position, HSBC’s CET1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of 2025, being a level that is quite comfortable and above its own target range to be between 14-14.5% over the medium term. However, the bank concluded the acquisition of minority interests in Hang Seng Bank last January, having a negative impact of about 110 bps in its CET1 ratio. Adjusted to this, its CET1 should be closer to 14% in Q1 2026, a level that is now below its target range, and therefore HSBC aims to restore the capital ratio to a higher level over the coming quarters and has decided to suspend share buybacks for the time being.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>As the bank’s organic capital generation is good and its dividend payout policy is to distribute half of its earnings through dividends to shareholders, HSBC should take some quarters to have again an excess capital position, and I think share buybacks could be resumed closer to the end of this year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding dividends, HSBC’s dividends related to its 2025 fiscal year amounted to $0.75 per share, up by 14% compared to the previous year, showing that HSBC remains committed to returning a good part of its earnings to shareholders. For U.S. investors that hold HSBC’s ADR, the total <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556386-hsbc-holdings-declares-225ads-interim-dividend\">dividend</a> related to 2025 earnings was $3.75 per share. At its current share price, this leads to a dividend yield around 4%, which is still attractive, but it’s lower than it was in the past (around 5% when I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834267-hsbc-mixed-q3-2025-earnings-and-premium-valuation-makes-me-wary\">last covered it</a>) due to a higher share price over the last few months. This means HSBC’s income appeal is still interesting, but the bank is no longer a high-dividend yielder, being another sign, in my opinion, that its shares are somewhat overvalued.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While HSBC Holdings Plc has reported a decent financial performance during 2025, notable items remain considerable and make its reported figures somewhat weak. Despite that, the bank is showing good progress on improving its growth prospects and streamlining its business into areas where it can get higher returns, namely in Asia, which seems to be a good strategy over the long term. The market has rewarded HSBC with a much higher valuation over the past couple of years, which is now expensive in my opinion, plus the dividend yield is no longer that high compared to some months ago. Therefore, I maintain my hold ‘rating’ on HSBC as the risk-reward proposition for long-term investors doesn’t seem to be great right now.</span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Phenomenal. Yet, as you can see from the right side of the chart, the company shared only $4.1 billion of that (11.8%) with shareholders, and the vast majority of that was in the form of share buybacks because the dividend has also been stuck in the mud at only $0.01/share. You can barely even see the dark green dividend part of the rightmost bar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And herein lies the problem with the stock, in my opinion. The average fully diluted share count at year-end FY26 was 24.514 billion <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"versus\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">versus</em> 24.804 at year-end FY25. That is a reduction of only 1.2% yoy. Not much to crow about given <span id=\"jS$596\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> super-strong free-cash-flow profile. The fact is, <span id=\"jS$606\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> share buybacks are barely keeping pace with its stock-based compensation. In the quarterly release, the company said beginning in Q1 of fiscal 2027, it will include stock-based compensation expense in its non-GAAP financial measures. But don't let that distract you from the fact that that stock-based compensation in FY26 was $6.386 billion—up a whopping 34.8% yoy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now don't get me wrong here; I'm an engineer myself and certainly understand the need to reward and motivate talent with stock in order to attract and keep the best-of-the-best. I have no problem with that at all. However, with <span id=\"jS$711\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> massive free cash flow generation, the company is in a position to easily fully fund research, AI investments, and a strong stock-based compensation plan while also implementing a strong share buyback plan <em>and</em> giving shareholders another great reason to own the stock: strong dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shareholder Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> currently only pays a token (pun intended...) quarterly dividend of $0.01/share. And that is likely only paid so that investment funds that require a company to pay a dividend can check the box and add <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> stock to their portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But consider this: NVIDIA's free cash flow in Q4 alone was $34.9 billion, and that equates to $1.42/share estimated based on the 24.514 billion average diluted share count at year-end FY26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">$97 billion of FCF for all of FY26 equates to an estimated $3.96/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I argue that there is clearly a massive disconnect here in terms of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> management directly rewarding <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> shareholders out of the massive free cash flow the company is generating—and will continue to generate. Yet on the previously referenced Q4 conference call, when analyst Timothy Arcuri of UBS Investment Bank, Research Division, pointed out these basics and asked the following:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>... you're going to probably generate about $100 billion in cash this year (but) no matter how good the results have been, the stock hasn't really gone up much ... So I was wondering if you can talk about ... why not put a big stake in the ground and just have a huge share repo here?</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> VP <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">&amp;</em> CFO Collette Kress responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We look at our capital return very, very carefully, and we do believe that one of the most important things that we can do is really supporting the extreme ecosystem ... But of course, we are still repurchasing our stock. We are still with our dividend as well, and we will continue to find the right unique opportunities within the year for doing those different purchases.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As soon as I heard that reply, which I consider to be weak in the extreme, I knew the chances were good that <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> stock would sell off today. Because the simple fact is this: the market is not only wondering if the companies investing in building AI data center investors are going to make a good return on their investments in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> GPUs, <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> investors are wondering if they are ever going to directly see the benefits of the massive free cash flow the company they have invested in is generating. Right now, <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> hasn't given them a clear line of sight into those direct rewards. In fact, sticking with the theme of the title, it's a muddy picture at best.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Circular Financing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some might consider <span id=\"jS$1160\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> constant flow of funding to customers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars (which many see as <i>“circular financing”</i>...) as a weakness and a tacit acknowledgment that, just perhaps, CEO Jensen Huang isn't really as confident in the company's future relative to the very bullish picture he keeps painting quarter after quarter on the conference calls and elsewhere. So they are likely asking the question: why isn't he buying back more <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> shares or paying a meaningful dividend directly to shareholders? Great question, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, just today (Thursday), <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/nvidia-spent-70-billion-on-corporate-deals-to-fuel-chip-demand\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/nvidia-spent-70-billion-on-corporate-deals-to-fuel-chip-demand\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg reported</a> that <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> has spent $70 billion in FY26 on corporate deals with companies like OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), and others to fuel GPU orders. That was more than 2x spent the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such a growth trajectory in what is arguably circular financing reminiscent of Cisco Systems prior to the dot-com meltdown has investors on edge. <span id=\"jS$1304\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> comments on this subject during the Q4 conference call that, apparently, indicate that investors should consider this strategy to go on ad infinitum. In my view, this is raising risks and undermining investor confidence in the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Solution</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is frustrating, at least for an investor like myself, is that <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> has the power to easily solve the problem and restore investor confidence in the company: announce a big, meaningful stock buyback plan that will really move the needle (i.e., on the order of $50-$100 billion), or declare a meaningful dividend and announce a significant change in the dividend policy that prioritizes dividend growth, or a rational combination of both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, a $0.10 quarterly dividend ($0.40 annually) still represents only ~10% of <em>last</em> year's free cash flow, leaving more than enough to fund the other buckets (R&amp;D, large share buybacks, AI investments). However, if <span id=\"jS$1453\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> management continues to devote the vast majority of its significantly growing free cash flow toward more circular financing corporate deals, the company cannot fund significant share buybacks or a decent dividend policy, let alone both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), on the other hand, has been averaging 10% dividend increases for years. While the current annual dividend obligation ($2.60 for a 0.78% yield) might not look like much to those unfamiliar with the company, Broadcom stock split 10:1 in 2024; otherwise, the annual dividend would be $26/share, and I can tell you from owning Broadcom stock for many years now, the yield on cost is very, very attractive. Indeed, over the past decade, Broadcom has grown the dividend at a CAGR of 30% (slide from the current company <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/602c2fd3-89a0-436f-b638-4890f20feda7\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/602c2fd3-89a0-436f-b638-4890f20feda7\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>):</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1271\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom Dividend Growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet Broadcom has had no problem investing in the future, enacting a strong share-based compensation program, and continually approving strong stock buyback plans.

Which has many investors likely asking: why does <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> feel the need not only to do so but also to allocate the vast majority of free cash flow into doing so?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meantime, the rigid old tech narrative that \"growth companies don't pay dividends; they invest in the future\" is frequently used as an excuse by management teams not to reward shareholders with dividends directly into their pockets. Interestingly enough, many shareholders are somewhat brainwashed into repeating and supporting that narrative—even though it is arguably a campaign against their own economic self-interests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Broadcom, Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and other leading technology companies have all proven that high-quality tech growth companies with strong free cash-flow profiles can, and do, pay dividends and consistently grow that dividend while still strongly investing in growth initiatives for the future. <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> is now arguably the highest free-cash-flow-generating company of all time, yet they are stuck in the mud with a $0.04 annual dividend payment—a mere pittance of the estimated $3.96/share of free cash flow the company generated in FY2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">&amp;</em> Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was prepared for a sell-off in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> stock today and took advantage of it to begin (finally) scaling into the stock with <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">two</em> purchases (I'm in at ~$188).

Trading remains quiet, and the general consolidative tone continues amid a relatively quiet news stream. Although US and Iranian talks are set<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to continue next week, the market remains on edge.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are three developments to note. First, the PBOC abolished the reserve requirement on foreign exchange forwards and adjusted rules to make it easier for Chinese banks to provide yuan liquidity to offshore markets. This has the effect of weakening the yuan. Second, the Danish Prime Minister has called for snap elections for next month (March 24) to secure a stronger mandate as it seeks a stronger hand to resist US pressure over Greenland. Third, the Greens won the byelection in the Gorton and Denton constituency in Great Manchester. This would seem to complicate the Labour government’s challenge, which is from both the right and left.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Prices </strong></h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>G10</span></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The euro traded in a little more than a quarter-cent range around $1.18 yesterday. It remains mired in a choppy range of around $1.1740-1.1860. It is fraying the down trendline from late January (~$1.18) in this sideways movement. Options for 1.85 bln euros expire there today. A close above the 20-day moving average (~$1.1825) would help the technical tone. Short-term participants do not appear to have much conviction at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The dollar recorded an inside day against the yen and remained within Wednesday’s ~JPY155.35-156.80 range yesterday and has continued to do so today. It has chopped between about JPY155.55 and JPY156.25 today. The new nominees to the BOJ seem to undermine any threat of intervention, and the market appears likely to test the official resolve. One hindrance is that the US 10-year yield has slipped to four-month lows below 4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Sterling, on the other hand, posted an outside day, trading on both sides of Wednesday’s range. It settled slightly below Wednesday’s low. It tested the 200-day moving average (~$1.3450). It did so in the second half of last week, but has not settled below it since mid-January, which proved to be the bottom rather than presage a sharper decline. Options for a little more than GBP400 mln at $1.3500 expire today, which it has stayed mostly below, while at the same time, it has held above $1.3460. There was little impact from the Greens’ victory in the Greater Manchester special election.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The US dollar posted an outside day against the Canadian dollar, but the close was within the range, neutralizing the technical signal. It was the seventh consecutive session that CAD1.37 was frayed on an intraday basis, but the greenback has not settled above it once. Still, the market does not appear to have given up. A convincing break of CAD1.3640, however, would suggest it has. So far today, it is trading in a narrow range between about CAD1.3660 and CAD1.3685.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The Australian dollar was sold to session lows yesterday near $0.7065 in the North American morning, but recovered to a little above $0.7110 in the afternoon before consolidating. It is trading firmly but quietly today between about $0.7095 and a little more than $0.7130. Resistance is in the $0.7140-50 area. Options for nearly A$925 at $0.7080 expire today. In the futures market, the odds of a May hike are little changed this week at about 85%.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>EM</span></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The Mexican peso finished softer yesterday, but its minimal loss - less than 0.2% - reflects its resilience in the face of the drawdown in US equities. In the inflation report, the central bank raised its growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.1%. The Q1 inflation projection of 4% was unchanged. Inflation is not seen reaching the 3% midpoint of the target range until Q2 '27. The range the dollar posted on Monday (~MXN17.10-MXN17.30) continues to prevail. Today, it has been confined to a MXN17.1665-17.22 range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The PBOC took two measures that took the wind from the yuan bulls. First, it eliminated the reserve requirement on foreign exchange forwards from 20% to zero, making foreign currency holdings more attractive. Second, it refined the banking rules and endorsed Chinese banks’ role in providing yuan liquidity to offshore markets. The dollar rose a little above CNH6.8605 today after it slipped a little below CNH6.8270 yesterday. Even with today’s minor loss, the offshore yuan rose for the fourth consecutive week, and the nearly 0.60% gain is the largest weekly advance since last August. The last time the fix rose on a weekly basis was in late November, which itself was the first time since the end of September. The dollar’s reference rate was unchanged today at CNY6.9228 yesterday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The dollar pushed slightly higher against the Indian rupee today. It reached a new high for the week, slightly below INR90.98. Yesterday’s high was around INR90.9250, and today’s low about INR90.9375. Separately, India revised this year’s growth forecast to 7.6% from the 7.4% projection made last month.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Other Markets</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Equities: Most large bourses in the Asia-Pacific region advanced. Tokyo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKY:IND\" title=\"NIKKEI 225 Index\">NKY:IND</a>) reached record highs. Profit-taking hit high-flying South Korean Kospi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOSPI\" title=\"KOSPI Index\">KOSPI</a>) and knocked it back 1%. It still rose 7% this week. Indian equities were also an exception and got tagged for more than 1%. After a minor loss yesterday, Europe’s STOXX 600 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX\" title=\"STOXX Europe 600 Index\">STOXX</a>) is posting a minor gain today. Barring a setback, it will be the fifth weekly advance. It has fallen in only one week since mid-December. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq futures (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a>) are off more than 1% and the S&amp;P futures (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>) are off half as much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Benchmark 10-year yields are lower. Soft Tokyo inflation sent the 10-year JGB down nearly four basis points. European rates are slightly softer, while the 10-year US Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US10Y</a>) is off 1-2 bp and is down nearly 10 bp this week to below 4% for the first time since the end of last November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Gold is consolidating quietly between $5167 and $5200. It remains in the range set Tuesday. Silver is trading quietly within the ranges seen in the past two sessions and is a little below $90 in late-European morning turnover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• April WTI appears to have rebuilt the weekend premium. It is near yesterday’s high (~$66.75). The high settlement this week was on Monday, around $66.30.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Data</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• US PPI inflation looks to have slowed in January. A 0.3% rise in the headline and core rate will, given the base effect, allow the year-over-year headline rate to slow to 2.6% (from 3.0%) and the core rate to 3.0% (from 3.3%). The Chicago PMI may receive some passing interest ahead of November construction spending. Construction spending was virtually flat in the first ten months of 2025, after rising by an average of 0.1% a month in the first 10 months of 2024 and a heady 1.1% monthly average in the first 10 months of 2023. The Kansas Fed’s February service survey is of little consequence to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Canada will report December GDP, which is seen growing by 0.1% after a flat November. It is unlikely to deter a small contraction in Q4 (-0.2% annualized, according to the median forecast in Bloomberg’s survey) after 2.6% expansion in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Mexico’s trade balance displays a strong seasonal pattern toward deterioration in January. It has done so for the past 14 years without fail. It is expected to have done so last month. Last year, Mexico’s exports rose by about 7.6%, while imports rose by almost 4.4%. Mexico’s trade balance swung into a surplus of around $770 mln last year from an $18.54 bln deficit in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The ECB’s inflation survey showed a minor change in inflation expectations. The one-year outlook eased to 2.6% from 2.8%, and the three-year outlook was unchanged at 2.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Australia’s private sector credit growth remained robust in January, rising by 0.5%. It accelerated in H2 '25 and appears to be one of the factors that underpin expectations of additional tightening by the central bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Japan reported several important data points. First, the February Tokyo CPI, a harbinger of the national figures, edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% and the core rate eased to 1.8% from 2.0%, helped by new energy subsidies. It is the lowest core reading since April 2024. It peaked last May at 3.6%. Second, retail sales bounced back 4.1% after they fell by 2.0% in December. Third, industrial production surged 2.2% in January (-0.1% in December).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.marctomarket.com/2026/02/pboc-steadies-yuan-denmark-calls-snap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

This index represents the main Brazilian large and mid-caps, which are highly <a href=\"https://www.msci.com/indexes/index/702752\" rel=\"nofollow\">concentrated</a> (~42%) in four companies: Nu Holdings Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NU\" title=\"Nu Holdings Ltd.\">NU</a>), Vale S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VALE\" title=\"Vale S.A.\">VALE</a>), Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A.

There is also daily rebalancing, where every day, at the close, the ETF rebalances its exposure to maintain 3x for the following day. In a strong trend, this works very well, but of course, in sideways markets, there is volatility decay where even when the index is practically at zero, this effect destroys performance in erratic markets. And all this is done for a rather steep <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRZU/expenses\">fee</a> of 1.22%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-17721301450375154_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1862\" data-height=\"730\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-17721301450375154_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BRZU\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-17721301450375154_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-17721301450375154_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-17721301450375154_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-17721301450375154_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, BRZU is clearly designed to be a tactical, short- to medium-term ETF — particularly useful for betting on a specific macro regime. If the current macro backdrop is indeed shifting, this may be one of those moments where leverage makes sense. In that context, I view BRZU as a Buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s break down the macro drivers behind that view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Conditions Supporting Brazilian Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil today has an interest rate of 15% (Selic) — recently maintained at January 28 — and inflation (IPCA) over the last twelve months of 4.44%. This implies a real interest rate of ~10.56%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772130187942024_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"928\" data-height=\"746\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772130187942024_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"SELIC\" width=\"640\" height=\"514\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"514\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772130187942024_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772130187942024_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772130187942024_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772130187942024_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Banco Central do Brasil</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, in the U.S., the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fed funds target range</a> is at the upper limit of 3.75% and the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-slowed-in-january-as-consumer-prices-rise-24-over-prior-year-to-start-2026-133531279.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CPI of 2.4%</a> over the last twelve trailing months — implying a real interest rate of only ~1.35%. This gives a real rate spread between Brazil and the U.S. of ~9.21 p.p.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In practical terms, this is a direct link to a theme of carry trade and support for the BRL as long as the “risk” regime helps. To put it even more succinctly, a global investor can capture funds in USD at ~3.5%-4%, convert to BRL, and invest 15% in a Brazilian government bond (NTN-B, \"Notas do Tesouro Nacional\" indexed to inflation) or other fixed income instruments, and hedge the FX partially, or not. This sequence of flows generates demand for BRL, which naturally triggers an appreciation of the BRL vs. the USD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_9346f8290d47db8c26a190c0d6dbb252.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_9346f8290d47db8c26a190c0d6dbb252.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_9346f8290d47db8c26a190c0d6dbb252.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_9346f8290d47db8c26a190c0d6dbb252.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since FX is largely a function of portfolio flows, if there is foreign demand for Brazilian bonds (which will need to be bought in BRL), this creates structural pressure for appreciation and a reduction in the risk premium. And this compresses the equity risk premium, leading to multiple expansion in the Ibovespa — the Brazilian stock market index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DXY links to this story as the USD is extremely sensitive to real interest rate differentials and global liquidity. If there is a dovish scenario from the Fed where real interest rates fall, liquidity improves, risk decreases, and the USD tends to weaken, the DXY falls because the carry advantage of holding USD decreases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_70b15d5fcea369b51b373789f5c247fc.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_70b15d5fcea369b51b373789f5c247fc.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_70b15d5fcea369b51b373789f5c247fc.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_70b15d5fcea369b51b373789f5c247fc.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The graph below, showing foreign inflows into B3 (the Brazilian stock exchange) well above average, is very much in line with the recent acceleration in Brazilian equities and above the moving average, which leads me to believe that foreign inflows are coming in at a rate above the recent normal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772126504720333_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1994\" data-height=\"1260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772126504720333_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"B3\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772126504720333_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772126504720333_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772126504720333_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784245-1772126504720333_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>dadosdemercado.com.br</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Volatility Regime and Leverage Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Usually, the best time to use leverage is when volatility isn't exploding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most direct way to quantify this is based on the implied volatility of the Brazilian equity market itself, in this case by looking at the S&amp;P/B3 Ibovespa VIX (the 30-day implied volatility of the Ibovespa).

So, if one can question whether the fiscal risks could reprice, it certainly could, but the market today seems to be accepting Brazil risk at less of a premium, largely because the global backdrop helps.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Primary Risk Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At first glance, investors may be more hesitant about the risks associated with the composition of the MSCI Brazil 25/50 more because of the concentration in commodities, as in the case of the large positions in Vale and Petrobras, which, in theory, are impacted by more complex macro issues derived from the correlation with the iron ore and oil markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The interesting thing is that both Vale and Petrobras have risen more strongly, especially in the last couple of months, not necessarily tracking the underlying commodity price action over the same period, which also leads me to believe that there is a strong sensitivity to FX as a primary driver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_3ff34585259e2cbb60229c48f0b5344e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_3ff34585259e2cbb60229c48f0b5344e.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_3ff34585259e2cbb60229c48f0b5344e.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_3ff34585259e2cbb60229c48f0b5344e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risks associated with leverage, especially in an asset group that usually carries a high volatility given the country risk, are naturally around the fact that losses can compound quickly and may significantly exceed those of a non-leveraged ETF of Brazilian equities, such as the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWZ\" title=\"iShares MSCI Brazil ETF\">EWZ</a>), for example. For this reason, I subscribe to the idea that the BRZU should be used tactically, requiring almost daily monitoring and occupying no more than 2-5% of the portfolio allocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One way of structuring risk could be to use a scaling strategy, where you start with a small base position and add to it if the DXY remains weak, the flow accelerates, and commodities confirm the momentum. Or trim if vol starts to rise, flow slows, and DXY stabilizes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I believe this is a good time to be a BRZU bull as there is still plenty of opportunity to make good money amid what looks to me like a very clear and strong ongoing rotation to EM, and with Brazil at the epicenter of that movement due to carry, FX, and risk premium compression.</span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But going long a leveraged ETF that seeks to track equities from an emerging country involves constant risk management, which is why I would advise moderately measuring positions according to one's level of risk tolerance and reducing exposure if conditions deteriorate.</p>",

Operating profit climbed 38% to £3.5 billion, indicating a strong margin expansion of 3.2 points to 17.3%. Free cash flow climbed 35% to £3.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Civil Aerospace sales grew 15% to £10.4 billion, with aftermarket sales increasing 21% and original equipment manufacturer sales growing 3%. We note that engine deliveries to OEMs were substantially lower, but a positive revenue mix leaning towards higher value large engines still led to a modest growth in revenues. IAE V2500 sales were down, driven by timing of services demand. This may seem counterintuitive given the demand for engine services as new airplanes are being delivered late. However, per platform, there can be volatility driven by cycle timing and operator decisions on maintenance scheduling and engine and airplane fleet decisions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regional revenues were up 3%, while business aviation sales were flat, which I believe largely reflects the high demand for business jets being constrained by the supply chain. Large engine sales grew 21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross profit increased 34% to £+2.7 billion, with margins growing 3.7 points to 25.8% on high aftermarket sales growth, including high spare engine sales, which are more profitable compared to engine deliveries to OEMs. Operating profit climbed 41% to £2.1 billion, with margins climbing 3.9 points to 20.5%. The overall story for Civil Aerospace is that of high growth in sales for the highly profitable aftermarket streams.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues grew 8% to £4.8 billion for Defense with gross profits increasing 4% to £933 million with margins shrinking 80 basis points to 19.6% and operating profit increasing 9% to £689 million with margins that were more or less stable at 14.4%. OEM sales grew 18%, while services sales grew 1%, so it is the opposite of what we see in the civil aerospace segment. In the year prior, Rolls-Royce had a tailwind from a one-off £220 million sale-and-leaseback transaction. Absent of this, the revenue growth would have been 14%, which provides a better growth figure of the recurring business. Transport sales grew 20%, while naval sales grew 11%. In the high single digit growth bucket, helicopters grew 9% and combat grew 7%, while submarine sales declined 1%, driven by the one-off item. I believe that excluding this transaction, the sales growth would have been around 18% for Submarines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So adjusted revenue growth was more or less in line with civil aerospace growth. Given that the civil aerospace sales and sales growth lean more toward profitable services growth compared to defense, the operating profit growth was less robust for defense. However, we do see that civil and defense are both growing, which also aligns with the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864573-the-1-2-trillion-aerospace-and-defense-supercycle\">aerospace and defense supercycle</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Power Systems sales grew 19% to £4.9 billion, while operating profit grew 60% to £852 million as margins expanded from 13.1% to 17.4%. OEM sales grew 23%, while services sales grew 12%. Interesting to note is that growth was driven by data center growth as well as governmental growth. Growth in power generation and governmental sales was 30% and 14%, while marine sales grew 7% and industrial sales declined 14%, which I believe is due to global industrial weakness. Another highlight was that the battery energy storage system, which accounts for just 2% of sales, grew 194% and is now break-even, which provides an indication that growth beyond this point will add to profits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rolls-Royce Guidance Lacks Detail But Points At Another Stellar Year</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437030049198_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1301\" data-height=\"732\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437030049198_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the guidance for Rolls-Royce.\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437030049198_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437030049198_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437030049198_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437030049198_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Rolls-Royce (Supplemental Slide Deck Earnings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rolls-Royce has provided growth estimates for 2026.

The company now expects £4.9-£5.2 billion in operating profit compared to £3.6-£3.9 expected earlier. Margin guidance has been lifted from 15%-17% to 18%-20%. With free cash flow guidance lifted by £800 million to £5-£5.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth is driven by wide-body aftermarket performance and Trent XWB engine deliveries reaching break-even or slightly positive. Higher spare engine sales should positively improve both the sales and margins, while business aviation sales should improve as supply chain challenges fade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Defense, the increase in global demand for defense systems should drive OEM and aftermarket sales, while power systems should benefit from emerging growth in data center power demand, battery storage, and nuclear power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, Rolls-Royce is positioned well to capitalize on growth in aerospace and defense and energy (nuclear and battery storage), including AI-driven growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rolls-Royce Stock Remains Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To determine multi-year price targets, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true\">The Aerospace Forum</a> has developed a stock screener that uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows, and the most recent balance sheet data.

However, somewhat counterintuitively, we are lowering the price target for 2027 from around $20 to $17.89. That is my base case price target, indicating 8% upside and 19% upside when factoring in the earnings expectations for 2028. The reason why price targets have been lowered is because the peer group trading multiple has dropped from 23.5x to 22.8x. The growth expectations remain robust with 8% growth annually for sales, EBITDA and free cash flow. The company’s median EV/EBITDA is substantially lower, but we note that the company has executed a remarkable turnaround, which I believe means that the EV/EBITDA for the prior years no longer reflects the company’s potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Normally, I am looking for around a 10% return per year. Rolls-Royce does not have that, but I do believe that its strong balance sheet combined with end market growth in aerospace and defense as well as power drives substantial prospects for modest upside in the stock price and increasing shareholder returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437032714078_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2305\" data-height=\"1309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437032714078_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the key metrics for Rolls-Royce by The Aerospace Forum.\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437032714078_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437032714078_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437032714078_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9932311-17721437032714078_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Aerospace Forum</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The image above better captures why I remain bullish on the stock. We note that sales and EBITDA continue to grow. Typically, you would also be looking for higher EBITDA margins. However, OEM sales, which tend to be lower margin (if there is any margin to start with), will also grow. So the margin profile will not necessarily show strong expansion. Those lower-margin sales, however, do pave the way for longer-term aftermarket high-margin returns. Watch items remain the ramp-up of the Airbus A350 production, which is powered by Trent XWB engines; the ramp-up for the A330neo, for which Rolls-Royce also is the exclusive provider of engines; and ramp-up and sales campaigns for the Boeing 787 on which Rolls-Royce is one of two engine suppliers. Additional long-term growth opportunities are demand from the energy market and entry into the narrow-body market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free cash flow is expected to grow substantially, and as the company has successfully completed its turnaround, it can substantially bring down its cash pile, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557793-rolls-royce-rises-as-profits-surge-growth-outlook-brightens\">returning between £7 billion and £9 billion to shareholders through repurchases</a>. Even while doing so, the company will be able to reduce debt to near zero by 2028 and still return its free cash flow to shareholders beyond 2028 while remaining in a net-cash position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is why I remain bullish on the company. The upside may not be what we are looking for, but there is a potential to substantially increase dividends as the company brings down the share count.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there is one element that I am perhaps not too fond of, then it would be that I would have rather seen Rolls-Royce bring down the share count before reinstating its dividend. That would have allowed the company to initiate a higher dividend payment per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Rolls-Royce Is Becoming More And More Attractive For The Long-Term</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Rolls-Royce, we note that the upside is not necessarily an extremely attractive one. However, what we see is that the company has laid the foundation for stronger performance in the past years, and it is now ready to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Given the formidable balance sheet, it allows the company to return all of its free cash flow to shareholders, and that creates an attractive long-term opportunity for investors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The revenue <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863928-lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">grew by</a> ~9% YoY reflecting a production ramp in missiles and munitions, and higher delivery volumes. The backlog reported was ~$194b - more than double the TTM revenue of ~$75b. The backlog growth was only 6%, lower than revenue growth, but it is still sufficiently strong enough for more than a few quarters of slower backlog growth before it becomes an area of discussion. Importantly, the book-to-bill ratio at 1.2 confirms demand exceeds delivery. That creates a stable operating base. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720859141208842_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720859141208842_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue Growth YoY - LMT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720859141208842_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720859141208842_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720859141208842_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720859141208842_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Revenue Growth YoY - LMT <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, growth appears concentrated. Missiles &amp; Fire Control (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MFC\" title=\"Manulife Financial Corporation\">MFC</a>) is expected to grow at double digits driven by PAC-3 and THAAD multiyear frameworks. Space is not growing at the same pace though (mid single digits), and outlook for Aeronautics and RMS is even more modest. Since revenue acceleration is not broad-based, the net growth expected in 2026 is ~5%, as per management guidance. That is not a negative for LMT's thesis - it actually shows topline growth coupled with strong demand and increasing production capacity for a third consecutive strong year ahead - but a broader growth story would have been a catalyst markets would have rewarded after most good news is digested. The current thesis points toward stability rather than any new inflection.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720866370202954_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720866370202954_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Annual Revenue Growth YoY - LMT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720866370202954_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720866370202954_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720866370202954_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720866370202954_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Annual Revenue Growth YoY - LMT <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The MFC growth story also comes with a few nuances. As production ramps, the margins could be hit by 20-30bps in the initial years. Execution risks are still applicable. Make-whole clauses reduce financial risk, but they do not eliminate program timing risk. The overall picture is that of a capital intensive phase ahead with margin impacts and execution risks - so the growth excitement is tempered.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Engine and Investments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The quarterly EBIT margins chart below (calculated using <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT/income-statement\">financials</a> reported in Seeking Alpha) show a cluster around 11-13% (excepting two potentially charge distorted quarters). The most recent quarter actually shows a slightly lower margin. However, the important story is not a single quarter dip, but a stable band generally seen prior - there is no structural expansion seen. This looks like a pattern where revenue grows but no operating leverage breakout is evident. This is again not a negative per se, but premium multiples (we will discuss in the subsequent section) should be backed by either a breakout growth catalyst or an expanding margins profile - neither of which look supported.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720878900723581_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720878900723581_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EBIT Margin - LMT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720878900723581_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720878900723581_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720878900723581_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62089123-17720878900723581_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EBIT Margin - LMT <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same lack of catalyst is seen in the FCF charts too.

This is actually a step up from the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT/cash-flow-statement\">total capex of</a> ~$1.65b in 2025, by almost 60% when revenue is growing at 5%. As a percentage of revenue the capex of ~2.2% of revenue today is expected to be higher at ~3.2% of an increased revenue of ~80b (more than implied by the 5% guidance). That means there is no breakout story in either margins or FCF in 2026. Again, a compounding story where valuations and recent returns become important.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Needs Inflection</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At ~22x trailing free cash flow, Lockheed Martin trades above its long term mid-cycle band of ~14-18x. This is fair value in my opinion given higher valuations we have seen in the 2025 growth markets. But any rerating from here should be backed by structural margin expansion or a sustained FCF above $8b, both of which are unlikely in a capital intensive phase in 2026. Segment margins are guided at around 10.9%. Missile ramp is initially dilutive. Aeronautics margins are pressured by sustainment mix and RMS is still normalizing. Despite strong demand, there is no indication of a clear multi-year acceleration beyond the ~5% revenue growth levels we are seeing now. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_c13b66d603c13f48c4e51a170a77fe1e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_c13b66d603c13f48c4e51a170a77fe1e.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_c13b66d603c13f48c4e51a170a77fe1e.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_c13b66d603c13f48c4e51a170a77fe1e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since I cannot bank upon an inflection-driven rerating ahead, the heavy lifting has to be done by compounding. That is possible. The current strength in margins and FCF can definitely support a mid single digit total return ahead. As revenue grows as guided, margins hold and capex investments translate to volume increments (without material margin erosion), the stock can compound through earnings growth and dividends. But there is no asymmetry to call for fresh cash deployment at this stage. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact there are risks in missile ramp and its effect on margin dilution. At ~4.6% FCF yield, valuation risks are also real. If the defense sentiment cools or overall growth narratives soften in 2026, there is room for valuations to contract (~14-18x average mid cycle levels), despite recent compression from around 25-30x levels. These are not material risks at the moment, but so is the case with the upside thesis too - nothing material enough to drive a high conviction Buy. Overall, Lockheed Martin becomes a very strong Hold position therefore, not a Buy.</p>",

However, when I came across this comment, I thought it would be perfect to get your attention for a topic that applies to every single person reading this, regardless of whether you’re a 24-year-old college graduate or a 70-year-old who retired a few years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That comment was posted under a recent Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/yale-james-choi-portfolio-formula-stocks-02a96afb\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> about a new retirement formula, which obviously got my attention, as retirement investing has become a much bigger part of my coverage here on Seeking Alpha in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The article was about finding a new way to assess how much risk someone can afford to take. It was basically written to improve some of the ideas that have been out there for ages, including the traditional 60/40 idea and the rule where we subtract our age from 100 to find out how much equity exposure we should take.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my case, that number would be 70% equities, as I’m 30. For my parents, who turn 58 this year, that number would be just 42%. The 70-year-old I just used in my example would have just 30% exposure, which brings me back to the comment at the top of my article. Assuming the 70-year-old is a male, there’s a statistical chance of more than 40% he makes it to age 90, according to the JPMorgan data in the chart below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-1772018830761414_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-1772018830761414_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-1772018830761414_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-1772018830761414_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-1772018830761414_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-1772018830761414_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>JPMorgan</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You may know where I’m going with this. For starters, the comment on top isn’t just funny but also true, at least to a certain extent. It is still very easy to end up with money problems if you become too conservative at 70. If you’re blessed with a long life, which is obviously a good thing, you may have to cover at least two more decades of spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, I will discuss these situations and why we seriously need to rethink retirement investing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, before this intro gets out of hand, let’s get to it!</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s Time To Rethink Retirement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, whenever we discuss retirement strategies, the problem is that every situation is unique. So many times when I cover higher-yielding stocks, some people bring up the fact that if we start investing in growth stocks early enough, we may not even need high-yield stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I know that, but imagine if I wrote articles telling people who are required to buy higher-yielding stocks because of limited funds to just go back 30 years and make smarter life choices? I would become the most hated financial writer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even the example of the 70-year-old I just used is flawed. After all, if he were to retire with $200,000 in his investment account, which would pay him $20,000 in pre-tax income at a 10% yield, or retire with $2 million in the bank is a huge difference. With $2 million, you can reasonably expect to get $80,000 in income from a conservative 4% income portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you also decide to sell some principal, you’re all set, especially if we include Social Security payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, there’s obviously more to it than one’s age.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me back to the Wall Street Journal article. The article was based on a 47-page (including the appendix) <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34166/w34166.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">research paper</a> that covered just how unrealistic many formulas for retirement investing are:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Research on normative household financial choices almost always gives quantitative guidance in one of two forms: a simple formula for an unrealistic setting, or numerical solutions for only a few parameter sets in a realistic setting. We propose a middle-ground approach we call practical finance: analytic approximations to optimal solutions as a function of relevant parameters in realistic settings that are easily computed in a spreadsheet. We provide such an approximation for lifecycle portfolio choice with labor income. Across 5,103 parameter sets, our approximation results in welfare that is on average only 0.06% lower than that of the optimal solution.- Choi et al. 2025</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, the research is about a formula that also looks into one’s income, savings, and risk tolerance. Especially the risk tolerance is key, as I am someone who takes much bigger risks than average without losing sleep. Meanwhile, I know people who couldn’t handle investing in simple index funds. Everyone is different, as obvious as that may sound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One big factor is that we may have to spend more time on “safe assets.” According to the report, we don’t put enough weight on personal income (paychecks) and future retirement income. Essentially, this is bond-like income that doesn’t fluctuate with the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, there are situations where that isn’t the case, like in my situation (working in finance), but, in general, that’s bond-like income. Essentially, future earnings and Social Security are a floating-rate bond that needs to be incorporated in investment decisions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Think about it, if you have that kind of income/safety, why would you add another layer of safety in your investment portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, a 25-year-old with a $70 thousand annual income should, according to Choi’s formula, be 100% in stocks. That’s above traditional formulas, including the ones we just discussed:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306148777_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1290\" data-height=\"750\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306148777_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306148777_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306148777_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306148777_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306148777_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Wall Street Journal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, it’s important to keep your existing net worth into account.

Some investors can take more risks than others, as I already briefly mentioned. That’s why the model makes the case that a 70-year-old with a high-risk tolerance can easily have 64% in equities, based on an annual income of $72 thousand and a $1 million net worth. I absolutely agree with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306951613_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1290\" data-height=\"894\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306951613_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"444\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306951613_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306951613_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306951613_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306951613_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Wall Street Journal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, I also played around with the spreadsheet that was provided by the researchers (it’s mentioned in the WSJ article.

When adjusting that number to 7.0%, even most risk-averse portfolios for higher-aged people are geared toward overweight equity positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306490178_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1396\" data-height=\"660\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306490178_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306490178_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306490178_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306490178_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188306490178_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Google Sheets (Choi et al. 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I think that is a much better way to look at it, as it makes much better use of one’s financial capabilities, expectations, and bond-like income for cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although one can (and maybe should) make the case that AI increases labor uncertainty, this model seems the best approach to me, as people with a high-risk tolerance are simply leaving dollars on the table if they become conservative too fast, especially if they enjoy the safety of a high (future) income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think because time is our best asset (it’s finite, even for billionaires), we should focus way more on that instead of on basic allocation formulas and the obvious fact that bonds are less volatile than stocks. Less volatile doesn’t mean less risky if we look into potential lost opportunities on a long-term basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now What?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this part, I’m generalizing a lot. That may be obvious, but I still want to emphasize that none of this is personal financial advice. As I said, every situation is unique.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe in equities. That’s because I dislike bonds, as I simply prefer to buy ownership in actual companies that I trust. Moreover, while I own a few non-dividend-paying stocks, my goal is always to invest in companies that will, over time, provide steadily-growing dividends. Historically speaking, that’s where we buy alpha with a highly favorable volatility/risk profile, as the data below shows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188392426436_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1232\" data-height=\"930\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188392426436_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"483\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188392426436_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188392426436_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188392426436_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188392426436_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hartford Funds</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, for the 25-year-old age group, I think 100% equities makes sense. Here, I would focus on 0.00% to 2.0% yield with a double-digit growth profile. For example, Visa (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V\" title=\"Visa Inc.\">V</a>), Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), Old Dominion Freight Line (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODFL\" title=\"Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.\">ODFL</a>), Carlisle Companies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSL\" title=\"Carlisle Companies Incorporated\">CSL</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), and Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>). All of these are companies with competitive moats, low AI disruption risks (although Alphabet could fall behind if its AI models lack innovation), and secular growth tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Generally speaking, these companies focus more on reinvesting capital than on distributing it to shareholders. When combined with attractive risk/rewards and stellar capital allocation track records, these are the companies you cannot own enough of if you’re still four decades or so away from retirement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also note that I am not talking about ultra-high growth stocks here, like the ones that people were buying in 2021. I believe these speculative stocks have no place in serious portfolios unless we keep the exposure to less than 10%. After all, the future flows of salary are a reason to take risks, but not an excuse to change the risk/reward of the entire portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I often use the ARK Innovation ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARKK\" title=\"ARK Innovation ETF\">ARKK</a>) as a proxy for these stocks:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188318946166_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1376\" data-height=\"978\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188318946166_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"455\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188318946166_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188318946166_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188318946166_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188318946166_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Google Finance</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This may sound obvious, but you would be surprised how many portfolios I encounter among young people that are filled with growth stocks that all depend on very specific developments to make their valuations work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ideally, if you do this for 25 to 30 years, you don’t have to make any changes. Assuming you’re really good at picking stocks, you now own companies with such high yields on cost that you can retire based on these alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, for many, changing situations require changed portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you’re over 50, depending on an average income, the equity exposure recommendation drops to 76% (based on $400 thousand net worth) and 53% ($800 thousand net worth). These are the examples I just used based on Choi’s formula.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this situation, more mature dividend growers are perfect. Here, I would aim for yields of 2.5% to 4.0% with companies that have wide moats and a mix of cyclical and anti-cyclical growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Think about The Williams Companies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMB\" title=\"The Williams Companies, Inc.\">WMB</a>), PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>), Union Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNP\" title=\"Union Pacific Corporation\">UNP</a>), Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>), Lockheed Martin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>), and Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>). Essentially, these are many of the holdings of the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, to use ETFs as a proxy, we have seen this transition:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>20/25 years old until 50—Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGDV\" title=\"Capital Group Dividend Value ETF\">CGDV</a>)</li> <li>50 until 70 (retirement)—Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For my parents, I am running a strategy combining these two, as they own SCHD-like stocks that dominate their portfolio and some CGDV-like growth stocks to improve alpha and incorporate their age and income safety profile. The older they get, the more we will shift to income and safety, although we are unlikely to go into high bond positions due to the pensions they will receive. Using Choi’s logic, it would be a waste of capital to become too defensive if we don’t have to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the next stage is retirement. Again, ideally, if you’re 70 and have invested for 50 years, even moderate successes may have led to a high net worth. For example, investing $500 per month for 45 years at 7% (I went with 10% nominal and 3% inflation) turns into $1.7 million without any initial investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188317783906_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"800\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188317783906_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188317783906_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188317783906_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188317783906_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31557165-17720188317783906_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Compound Interest Calculator</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you have a net worth that high, you can massively reduce risk. If you don’t have a high net worth (like the majority of your peers), you may have to focus on generating higher income. In that case, I would prioritize REITs and midstream stocks, which, in general, are two of my favorite places to buy income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here, boring is good. Think about 5% to 8% income from stocks like NNN REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNN\" title=\"NNN REIT, Inc.\">NNN</a>), Realty Income (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O\" title=\"Realty Income Corporation\">O</a>), ONEOK (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE\" title=\"ONEOK, Inc.\">OKE</a>), Enbridge (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENB\" title=\"Enbridge Inc.\">ENB</a>), and Energy Transfer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET\" title=\"Energy Transfer LP Common Units\">ET</a>). The last one here is an MLP that issues a K-1 form.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of these are companies with &gt;70% payout ratios where the focus is on income. And while none of them have stock prices that are immune to recessions and other sell-offs, they all have highly predictable revenue and income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Few Notes On My Own Situation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, my personal situation is complex, and I’m, once again, breaking most rules.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>I have 100% of my liquid net worth in equities.</li> <li>I have no debt.</li> <li>Although I will pay rent until September, I will have a paid-off primary residence by then, which I expect to accelerate in value at no less than 10% per year.</li> <li>I’m 30 (as I already mentioned)</li> <li>I’m not a millionaire yet (very close, though), but I have a high net worth for my age group, which is key for the formula.</li> <li>I have no major safety nets (i.e., unemployment and retirement support from the government)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My income is very risky, as I have multiple projects/businesses going on, none of which result in highly predictable cash flows. Generally speaking, the research we discussed makes the case that I should own a lot of defensive stocks. However, I mostly own aggressive dividend (growth) stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a risk I am taking because I want to use the current market environment to my advantage and because I believe the timing for cyclical value stocks is right. However, I always have a higher-income plan in mind, as I often discuss here on Seeking Alpha.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If needed, I can rapidly transition to income to protect my expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk I am taking is getting into a spot where the stock market craters, erasing a big part of my net worth, which will make it much harder to generate a decent income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am essentially betting on my risk profile and ability to turn above-average returns into a strong nest egg as soon as possible. I’m essentially trying to do the whole <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">FIRE movement</a> as a speedrun. I’ll obviously keep readers up to date on this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this is the takeaway:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Retirement planning is a highly challenging thing, as every situation is unique.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, we discussed some new findings that shed some light on important factors that tend to have a huge impact on equity exposure. This includes our expected income, risk aversion, and expected returns. Without these factors, I think traditional methods are useless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I am breaking most of these rules, given that I run more risks than I should, I am essentially banking on my expected returns and risk awareness. That doesn’t work for everyone, which is why we discussed suitable investments for various age brackets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think by following some of these basic rules, we can do two things:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Create more suitable portfolios.</li> <li>Raise more awareness about the factors we need to keep in mind when building wealth.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Needless to say, I’ll shed way more light on this in the weeks, months, and years ahead.</p>",
