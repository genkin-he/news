Government energy subsidy measures<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> drove inflation lower quite meaningfully. Utility prices, such as electricity and gas, fell further by 6.6% in February compared to -2.2% in January. Cereal prices (mostly rice) grew notably less, from 11.3% in January to 7.5%. The high base for rice prices will continue to weigh on inflation throughout this year. Energy subsidies will end soon, so we expect temporary volatility in monthly changes. Yet, other government welfare programs, such as free tuition, are likely to lower inflation in the latter part of the year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although core inflation eased, we believe underlying price pressure remained sticky, as most of the price decline was driven by goods rather than services. In a monthly seasonally-adjusted comparison, inflation fell 0.1% month-on-month, with goods prices down 0.6% and services up 0.2%.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy and food prices dropped while underlying inflation remain sticky</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"812\" data-height=\"370\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Energy and food prices dropped while underlying inflation remain sticky\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BoJ will need additional evidence to hike rates</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, inflation is expected to stay below 2%. Yet, service prices, primarily driven by rising labour costs and strong demand, are likely to remain firm. This is expected to support the Bank of Japan’s policy normalisation of modest rate hikes. We believe it’s important to monitor April inflation data since that’s when many businesses set new prices based on their costs -- at the beginning of the fiscal year. As we mentioned in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874329-bank-of-japan-wont-alter-policy-normalization-path\" rel=\"noopener\">an earlier publication</a>, the recent BoJ board nominees who lean towards dovish policies will require stricter criteria to be met for rate hikes. Therefore, the BoJ is expected to act in June, once the results of the spring wage negotiations and the April CPI figures have been confirmed.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dove-hawk balance may not change meaningfully with two new dovish-tilting nominees</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"803\" data-height=\"424\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The dove-hawk balance may not change meaningfully with two new dovish-tilting nominees\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Bank of Japan, ING estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Industrial production\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"618\" height=\"159\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Auto sector recovery helped drive monthly data improvement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial production and retail sales rebounded in January, suggesting GDP growth will accelerate in the first quarter. IP rebounded 2.2% MoM in January (vs -0.1% in December, 5.5% market consensus), and retail sales also were up 4.1% (vs -2.0% in December, 1.5% market consensus). Details of both data were quite encouraging, as gains were widely spread. But also, the improvement in auto sector activity was quite impressive. Motor vehicle output rose for the second month, by 9.1% in January, following a 1.4% gain in December. Shipments rebounded to 8.8% after dropping in the previous two months. Motor vehicle retail sales surged 12.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stronger-than-expected retail sales data indicate that private consumption will lead growth, supported by strong wage growth. We believe lower inflation, helped by subsidies, will partly enhance consumers' purchasing power. Also, the recent rally in the local equity market should contribute positively to consumption. Today’s data support our view that GDP is expected to accelerate in 1Q26, driven by solid exports and consumption.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Retail sales rebounded firmly in January</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"794\" data-height=\"390\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Retail sales rebounded firmly in January\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Perhaps as a response to high prices and inflation, consumers are increasingly turning to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> secondhand goods, including and especially in the luxury category, to fulfill their shopping.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TheRealReal (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REAL\" title=\"The RealReal, Inc.\">REAL</a></span>), one of the leading \"re-commerce\" platforms, clearly demonstrates that shift in spending priorities. The company has showcased accelerating GMV across several quarters, allowing the company to generate meaningful economies of scale. In a market that has been incredibly punishing for growth stocks, TheRealReal has achieved nearly 2x share price appreciation over the past year, and a recent strong Q4 earnings print helped boost shares by a further ~10% (though the stock still remains down in January, along with most other small/mid-cap growth names).</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841873-the-realreal-accelerating-growth-in-a-tough-consumer-backdrop\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841873-the-realreal-accelerating-growth-in-a-tough-consumer-backdrop\" target=\"_blank\">I last wrote a \"Buy\" article</a> on TheRealReal in November, when the stock was trading at $11 per share. The company has been a major bright spot in my small/mid-cap portfolio, and with strong results and rising GMV under its belt, I don't see TheRealReal's outperformance coming to a halt anytime soon. I'm reiterating my \"Buy\"<strong> </strong>rating on this stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, there are a number of tailwinds that the company enjoys that cement the bull case for TheRealReal:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Accelerating GMV at scale. It's abundantly evident from TheRealReal's results that used luxury commerce is having its moment in the spotlight, with several sequential quarters of GMV growth despite reaching a sizable &gt;$2 billion annual scale.</li> <li>Large TAM. The company believes its annual addressable market for luxury resale in the United States is $200 billion, indicating its current GMV is only about ~1% penetrated into the total opportunity.</li> <li>Consignment focus has improved gross margin profile. In the past, TheRealReal used to run a mix of consignment/third-party sales alongside taking on its own inventory. The company has since shifted to becoming a capital-light, consignment-first business, which has pushed gross margins up to the mid-70%s: allowing for incredible economies of scale.</li> <li>Potential tailwinds from the gold boom.

Revenue growth accelerated slightly versus 17% y/y growth in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acceleration was driven by a boost in GMV, up 22% y/y to $616 million (and also accelerating two points versus 20% y/y growth in Q3). The company notes that GMV growth was driven by both an increase in the number of sales on the platform as well as a higher average price per sale. We do note that take rates, which represent TheRealReal's revenue as a percentage of consignment GMV sales, dipped -120 bps to 36.5%. This isn't a major concern, however, as the company attributed the take rate erosion due to the higher mix of high-end luxury sales that typically carry lower commissions for TheRealReal (but nevertheless profit strong gross profit dollars).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2054\" data-height=\"1154\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TheRealReal GMV trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TheRealReal GMV trends <span>(TheRealReal Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the company's active buyer base increased by 32k net-new users in Q4. It's important to note that TheRealReal's core focus for 2026 is to sustain longer-term relationships with its users. It's moving from becoming a transactional platform to an \"advisor for the closest.\" The company is noticing that many of its buyers are eventually also becoming sellers on the platform, and buyers who purchase secondhand luxury often do so with resale value in mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is realizing this vision through the release of MyCloset, which helps users to track the items they own and get price data for them. Per CEO Rati Levesque's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876029-the-realreal-inc-real-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Our marketing engine drives our sales execution. Active buyer growth accelerated in Q4 to 9% on a trailing 12-month basis. We aren’t just finding shoppers – we are identifying future consignors. Our Q4 results highlight this flywheel in action – 40% of new consignors come from our existing buyer base. By turning buyers into sellers, we’re acquiring supply more cost effectively while deepening the loyalty of our community. We accelerated new buyer growth in Q4 and we believe it’s a positive catalyst for future supply [...]</p> <p>As you may recall, we introduced MyCloset last year. The first phase was “reconsign,” which provides a one-click consignment experience for items purchased on TRR’s platform. The next step in the evolution of MyCloset is customer tools to track and capitalize on the value of their closet. We’re evolving our consignor interaction to make it less transactional and more relational and enduring; we are the trusted advisor for our customers as they journey through the primary and secondary luxury markets. Currently, we’re testing app features that allow consignors to get on-demand valuation and earnings estimates and look forward to expanding MyCloset as we move through 2026.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Building a repeat base of buyers and sellers helps drive efficiency in marketing and customer acquisition spending and is a further tailwind to profitability, which is already marching upward.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535324041314_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2066\" data-height=\"1154\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535324041314_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TheRealReal cost trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535324041314_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535324041314_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535324041314_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535324041314_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TheRealReal cost trends <span>(TheRealReal Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown in the chart above, gross margins improved 40 bps y/y, primarily driven by significantly improved profitability from direct sales.

We emphasize the fact that TheRealReal isn't a value stock, but at the same time, the company is still relatively early in its profit journey. We think there's a lot of conservatism baked into the company's FY26 outlook, especially given it's calling for only a 7.9% margin when it exited Q4 at an 11.3% margin. With adjusted EBITDA currently growing at a ~2x y/y pace, near-term valuation multiples are less meaningful for TheRealReal: so don't pass up on this stock just because it looks expensive on paper.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Buy\" the post-earnings momentum and stay long.</p>",

Net returns are net of management fees only.</p> <h3>Five-Year Retrospective</h3> <p>Before getting into a bit more detail on 2025 returns, we wanted to look back at how the strategy has performed in the various environments of the last five years.</p> <p>Initially, it looked as if the Asset Allocation team's thesis that the valuation gap would narrow was going to play out quite smoothly. As the world slowly returned to a post-Covid normality, value stocks that had been beaten down recovered nicely, while the growth darlings like Zoom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM\" title=\"Zoom Communications, Inc.\">ZM</a>) and Peloton (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON\" title=\"Peloton Interactive, Inc.\">PTON</a>) crashed back down to earth. From Equity Dislocation's October 2020 inception through December 2022, MSCI ACWI Value beat MSCI ACWI Growth fairly comfortably, and the strategy had a return profile within expectations, returning 40.3% cumulatively gross of fees (34.1% net).</p> <p>The emergence of Chat GPT into the mainstream at the start of 2023 reinvigorated investor enthusiasm for growth, however, putting a halt to value's winning streak. MSCI ACWI Value has underperformed MSCI ACWI Growth for each of the last three calendar years by an average of more than 10% per annum. Despite this headwind, the strategy has managed to generate a modest positive cumulative return over this 3-year period.</p> <p>We have noted previously that, even if the abnormally wide valuation spread does not narrow immediately, value can still outperform due to what we call the rebalancing effect: value benefits as some growth companies disappoint and become cheaper, entering the value index. Value also benefits as some value companies surprise on the upside and get repriced into the growth index. This effect is particularly pronounced when valuation spreads are wide because the valuation change associated with a move from value to growth, or from growth to value, is large. In the context of the Equity Dislocation Strategy, this rebalancing effect is demonstrated as strong security selection. It is this strong security selection, combined with effective risk controls, that has allowed us to generate a positive return over the last three years.</p> <p>We believe that this profile can be maintained, with the strategy managing remarkably well through periods of growth outperformance, while still delivering the excellent returns that we would expect in periods of value dominance. (For example, the last two months of 2025 saw value rotate back into the ascendancy—MSCI ACWI Value beat MSCI ACWI Growth by 5.0%, with the Equity Dislocation Strategy up 8.7% gross of fees and 8.3% net for the same period).</p> <p>From a diversification perspective, it is also worth noting that the strategy has exhibited a modest negative beta of -0.18 to MSCI ACWI over the period. We do not attempt to target negative beta. The strategy remains broadly dollar neutral (100% long/100% short) and so could be expected to be market and beta neutral. In reality, the overvaluations of growth stocks leave them much more susceptible to any kind of downturn, as we saw in 2022. That year was the only one of the last five years to deliver a negative return for equities, with MSCI ACWI down -18.4% and MSCI ACWI Growth trailing far behind at -28.6%. The Equity Dislocation Strategy returned 16.6% gross of fees (14.2% net) in 2022, and we believe that, similarly, it is likely to deliver meaningful, diversifying negative beta just when you need it in a growth-led sell-off.</p> <h3>Exciting Outlook</h3> <p>As we write in early January 2026, our 20% exposure 1 to the <a href=\"https://www.gmo.com/americas/product-index-page/alternatives/equity-dislocation-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equity Dislocation Strategy</a> remains the biggest high-conviction position in the Asset Allocation team's flagship unconstrained <a href=\"https://www.gmo.com/americas/product-index-page/multi-asset-class/benchmark-free-allocation-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benchmark-Free Allocation Strategy</a> . Quite simply, we believe that there is still considerable money to be made as the spread between value and growth inevitably narrows.</p> <p>We have included Exhibit 2 in our previous annual letters. When we launched the strategy, the relative valuation of the cheapest 50% of U.S. stocks over the most expensive 50% was at the 2nd percentile. Following two strong years for value in 2021 and 2022, the spread had narrowed to the 14th percentile. However, growth's dominance in 2023 and 2024, along with a modest win in 2025, has reversed all of that. The spread now sits very close to where we started, at the incredibly attractive 4th percentile. For value to return to its median historic relative valuation in the U.S., it needs to outperform growth by 70%. Globally, value would have to outperform by roughly 50% to return to a fair relative valuation.</p> <h4>Exhibit 2: Value Is Extremely Cheap</h4> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17721710618676891_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1134\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17721710618676891_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line chart showing the Relative Valuation of Cheapest 50% of U.S. Stock Market vs. Expensive Less Average from 1981 to 2023.

The long portfolio returned 33.0% gross, outpacing the MSCI ACWI Value return of 22.0% gross. The short portfolio also added meaningful alpha, having been up only 17.4% compared to the MSCI ACWI Growth return of 22.4%.</p> <p>In developed markets outside of the U.S., value beat growth fairly comfortably and the strategy performed as expected, with some 10.1% gross added to absolute performance. Some of the top performers were textbook deep value positions, as four of the top ten contributing long positions were Financials. Our meaningful yet well-diversified exposure to Automobiles and Auto Components was also significantly positive despite tariff-related volatility throughout the year.</p> <p>Growth modestly outperformed value in emerging markets, and the region detracted -1.0% from absolute performance. Although the long portfolio did very well, up 48.6% gross, the short book was up 63.6% gross. You probably would not have guessed that this result was in no small part due to three Korean Industrial stocks that enjoyed an average return of 165%. (For example, Doosan Enerbility (DOHFF), in the fast-moving game of nuclear power plant construction, was up a truly remarkable 270%.)</p> <p>The strategy successfully added 3.4% to absolute performance in the U.S., a real triumph given that MSCI USA Growth beat MSCI USA Value by 8.0%. Of course, our thoughtful risk control measures, coupled with our focus on quality in security selection, gave us a head start on this naïve measure as we did not overly suffer from the surge in some of the mega-cap tech. Although the long portfolio in the U.S. enjoyed strong performance, most of the alpha was added by the short portfolio.</p> <p>The most interesting sector was Information Technology, where we were short 28 U.S. securities. Despite it being a very strong year for equities, with the MSCI USA Growth Index up 20.9%, 18 of those stocks had negative performance while they were in the portfolio, and another two stocks had single-digit performance.</p> <p>One of the worst performers in the group for the year, which averaged an 80-bp short position and added 0.4% to absolute performance, was HubSpot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS\" title=\"HubSpot, Inc.\">HUBS</a>). If you are anxious to know what severe economic challenges HubSpot faced to send its shares crashing more than 40%, we will have to disappoint you—HubSpot grew its customers and revenues by broadly 20% during the year without compromising margins. Quite simply, high expectations for huge earnings beats meant that even strong results were viewed as insufficient, leading to sharp sell-offs. This is a key reason why we are not obsessing over identifying the catalyst for future growth stock underperformance—the weight of expectation built into valuations will inevitably lead to investor disappointment at some point.</p> <p>The other eight U.S. Information Technology stocks that we held short delivered an average performance of more than 63%. Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\">PLTR</a>), which was the single biggest detractor from absolute returns at the total portfolio level, was up a spectacular 135% for the year and is, somewhat bewilderingly, trading at a price/sales ratio well in excess of 100. Indeed, one of the reasons we remain excited about the Equity Dislocation Strategy is that there are plenty of stocks that continue to surf a wave of speculative excess. Exhibit 3 illustrates just how much this increased risk appetite has driven the market since the lows of “Liberation Day.”</p> <h4>Exhibit 3: Speculative Groups Continue to Lead the Market</h4> <p><em>High momentum and lower quality groups rallied most following Liberation Day market lows</em></p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-1772171061815355_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1095\" data-height=\"483\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-1772171061815355_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Bar chart showing returns for various market groups from 4/8/25 to 12/31/25.

Correlations are breaking down, political and fiscal paths<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are diverging, and yield curves are telling different stories across regions. At the same time, investors are grappling with a familiar constraint. Spreads are tight, so where can you still find attractive income, diversification, and flexibility without making a dramatic sell the US call?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My name is Anu Rajakumar, and today I'm joined by Paul Grainger, Senior Portfolio Manager on the Global Fixed Income team. Paul, welcome to the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Paul, let's start with some of the macro backdrop. For a while, especially during COVID and right after, it felt like everyone around the world was living through the same shocks, supply chains, the reopening surge. We saw policymakers around the world responding fairly similarly with big fiscal spending and then aggressive rate hikes, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to today, and policy paths look less uniform, and markets are starting to diverge. Why should investors pay attention to these shifts and the correlations that are starting to break down? What's driving it, and how does that create opportunity for investors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think the key point is what you've highlighted. There are opportunities for investors even in the current environment. I think the last three years generally rewarded a pretty straightforward approach to managing fixed income assets. You own duration to benefit from rates coming down. You own credit to benefit from the improved credit quality, but also the support to the economy from rates coming down. With hindsight, which is a wonderful thing, that was quite an easy trade to do. The question as we look forward is, where do we go from this when policy rates are closer to neutral?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They may not be there, but we're definitely closer. Credit spreads are tight. The macro and political risks are more varied across regions than they've been for some time. There is still income to be had from the market, but there's still the risk of volatility. The question really is, how do we deal with that? Part of it comes from what you said that the correlations are breaking down. Correlations breaking down is not necessarily a bad thing. It actually provides opportunities to allocate capital between different regions, between different sectors of the economy, between different parts of the yield curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that in the current environment, as part of a broader asset allocation, fixed income is really important as part of that diversification. The things that we'll be looking for as we go forward, for these correlations, but also the opportunities, are geopolitics. Just to be clear, this isn't just about the US and what's happening there. Obviously, we read a lot about US politics, but it's also what's happening in different parts of the world. We've clearly got different political dynamics happening in different countries in Europe. We've got an election coming up in Japan, although that will be done by the time many of the listeners listen to this podcast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've also got a lot of tensions in the UK, where I sit, with risks around the government and challenges potentially to the leadership of the ruling Labor Party. All these things on geopolitics, coupled with different growth rates, different inflation paths, and these varying fiscal constraints, mean that the ability of bond markets and economies to move in sync is going to be challenged as we go forward. That is actually to us really interesting and also to our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Now, you've mentioned a few different areas and regions. Europe is not just one homogeneous block either. It's lots of individual countries. Tell us more about why that's important for folks to really consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think actually that's a really important factor for investors, particularly for those investors who haven't historically invested in Europe. It's been quite easy for people in the past to look at Europe as one place and to say, Europe's doing well; Europe's doing badly. Those relationships really broke down during the Eurozone crisis, and actually, they've flipped on their head since then. During the Eurozone crisis, I'm sure everyone remembers, it was all about the periphery: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece struggling. They were really seen as the poor links, the poor relations in Europe, the bond markets you didn't want to own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">France and Germany were seen as the core stable markets where you wanted to allocate capital. That's really been turned on its head in the past few years, and it's been turned on its head for a couple of reasons. One is those periphery countries took their medicine. They went through some of the pain of having to tighten their fiscal budgetary positions. They've been through political changes. Some of them have more political stability than they have had in the past. At the same time, places like France have struggled to get its budget through in the past year, and there is more political uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The political dynamics have shifted. To put it in context, in 2022, Italian bond yields were around 2% higher than French bond yields. That yield spread now is the same. Italian and French bond yields in the 10-Year maturity are trading at the same yield level. Now, part of that is due to this changing, shifting political dynamics. Part of it clearly is due to the fact that investors have chased yield and wanted to move down the credit spectrum. That's been underpinned by improving fundamentals. To give a bit of an insight into Italy and what's happening there in domestic politics, Giorgia Meloni has now been in power for more than three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This may not sound like a long time for many investors on the call or many people listening. To put it in historical perspective, and I think these numbers are right, but I'm sure someone will fact-check and tell me if I'm wrong, I think there've been 31 prime ministers in Italy in the last 80 years, with only 6 of those serving more than 3 years. It's a big shift to actually have someone who's getting policy done, but also getting policy done when having been prudent and having gotten more credibility from the market. I think if people had said that five years ago, there would have been question marks around that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I guess where it leaves us is that, to your point that you raised, which is we have to look at Europe as a collection of countries, not a homogeneous block. As investors, that causes some challenges because the correlations are breaking down, but it also provide opportunity to allocate between those countries and not just think about allocating between the big blocks of US, Europe, and Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes, that's terrific. That role reversal of some of those countries in Europe is really quite astounding. Maybe just to continue on this theme, you mentioned this global phenomenon, and I just want to hear a little bit more. When you say global fixed income, how would you characterize the material differences between investing within the US bond market and investing globally? Also, just curious, what parts of the global market do you think people often overlook that actually can deliver that yield and diversification?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be breadth. The breadth of the global bond market is far wider than the US bond market. It's not a negative on the US bond market. It's just the facts of where issuances come from governments around the world, from corporates around the world, and from the so-called supranational and sovereign and agency issues. Essentially, we have multiple currencies, more countries, and a wider set of issuer types. We have 76 countries in the global bond index. We've got 29 currencies. We're able to rotate capital around those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, from a benchmark or a universe perspective for clients, what it means is you get some natural diversification. I guess it links to your earlier question about correlations. Post-COVID, correlations were really high. Markets, economies were moving in lockstep, particularly in the developed world. Even in developed markets now, we're starting to see divergence between those countries and those currencies. That gives a natural, almost hedge or natural cadence to these global portfolios, which means that you're not putting all your fixed income risk in one country and one currency related to one economy. That is really powerful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted as well that the global bond index does have some exposure to the so-called emerging markets, even though in this index, it is only investment grade. It's the higher-quality emerging markets there. Why is that important? It's important because for some time, they've taken a different path in terms of their economy, their monetary policy. They were earlier in raising rates than we were in the developed world. That means that we're now seeing a lot of opportunity come out in emerging markets. That, again, gives this natural diversification from being in global fixed income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that I will highlight that I think is a bit different when we look at the global bond market than just the US market is this so-called supranational sovereign and agency paper. These are bonds that are issued by entities that are linked to governments. They are very high-quality, typically AAA or AA. They can actually be higher quality than the individual governments because of the cross-governmental guarantees that come through. They're a big part of the benchmark. They're 20% of the benchmark. We're fortunate that we can access that market in a liquid way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes. No, that's very fair. The last question, you talked about the breadth of the opportunities, potentially rotating capital across dozens of countries and currencies to find that income and diversification. Paul, I want to touch on the US dollar as well. Of course, it depreciated quite significantly in 2025. General consensus is that it'll continue to depreciate in 2026, perhaps not to the same magnitude. I'd love to hear about your views on that and how that affects the opportunity set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Clearly, the dollar depreciated quite materially. There are a lot of forces at work, geopolitics, but also the fact that the Federal Reserve was cutting interest rates. We continue to think, as we said, the Fed will cut interest rates as the market's pricing. There are risks to the downside with a new Fed chair. However, the dollar can still come under pressure, but that is not necessarily the reason to be in global fixed income and to diversify and have a broader opportunity set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for a broader opportunity set is because of the potential for returns from that opportunity set, irrespective of what the dollar does, but also the ability to diversify and the ability to tap into other markets. Just to be clear, this isn't a dollar trade. This isn't the sell the US and buy everything else. This is part of a natural allocation that should be there in portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> I think that's a really important differentiation. This is not just a currency play, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Now, if we go region by region, I'd love to hear about where your team is seeing the most interesting relative value opportunities and what are some of the risks you're watching most closely, and further to that, any areas that you are actually avoiding at the moment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think in relative value opportunities, we always have to bring it back to what's being priced in by the market. We're constructive on European fixed income, and part of that is that we see European growth disappointing. We see ability for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates further. Right now, the market is pricing no further interest rate cuts from the ECB. That is an opportunity to allocate capital at relatively attractive European yields but also benefit from what we think will be interest rate cuts. That contrasts slightly with the US, where, again, we see the scope for interest rate cuts, but the market is already pricing that to some extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're much more driven there by the trading range environment that we're in. You put those two together, and it means that we are looking to be within global portfolios, overweight Europe relative to the US. Another area that I think until a few years ago people weren't really focusing on was Japan. Japan had been a market that no one had invested in, really, as an overseas investor or an international investor for many decades. That changed two or three years ago. We think there's a really interesting opportunity in Japan. There is volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We do think that that market, which is pricing in, I think, three interest rate hikes now, is obviously looking at a very different place to other global bond markets. We don't think that we'll get three interest rate hikes. We think on that basis, there is value in the market already. The yield curve is relatively steep because of concerns about fiscal issuance and the ongoing funding of the government. We actually think that that will provide an opportunity</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think there are areas that we're particularly negative or concerned about within fixed income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I would say is that within credit, credit spreads are tight. That comes down now to really focusing on where are the good quality companies, where are we going to be able to harvest some incremental income, some incremental returns, but also accept the fact that we will get bouts of volatility coming through there. We are relatively defensive, but do think there will be opportunities coming up</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Terrific. You laid up the next question yourself. Turning to credit. As you said, lots of questions are about tight spreads at the moment. Where are the good opportunities within credit? How are you approaching the area? What are the concerns that you have around credit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think the first thing I'll say is that we spend a lot of our time, like other fixed-income investors, focusing on spreads. Actually, we should be clear that across the fixed income universe, all-in yields still look relatively attractive. We should be clear that corporate bonds still give you income, so they still have a place in people's portfolios. When we look at the relative spreads and the relative pricing between corporates and governments, clearly, we're at a narrow end of the range that we've been in for some time. Spreads are tight for a reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They're tight because we've had improved credit quality, the positive growth environment we've been in, the support that we've had from central banks with interest rates being cut, and also, like every asset, they're driven by supply and demand. We've seen a lot of demand for fixed income and a lot of demand for corporate bonds. We think that will continue as we go through the year because there is this demand for income, because income gives you the cushion to the rest of your portfolio. To think about the question of where are the opportunities, the opportunities we think now are going to be in relative sector calls, looking at different issuers that come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, we know there is issuance coming to the market, and we can harvest some of that new issue premium. Clearly, one of the things we've seen recently is that the AI-related names, credit spreads have widened. Now, clearly, that's something that has been happening, but looking forward, we do think there's going to be opportunity in those names as well. Timing is not necessarily today, but these relative repricings will provide opportunities for us to allocate capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're also going to have to think carefully about where we allocate on the yield curve. Do we allocate to shorter-dated bonds or to bonds that are further out the curve? We're going to continue to see that. I think the key thing I would say is that in this environment, we're not in an environment where the rising tide of demand lifts all boats and all assets. So we're going to have to be much more nuanced about where we're allocating capital. We're going to have to really focus on research, in-depth analysis of the company, staying engaged, and being cognizant of the risks around us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes, no, and to your point, in an environment where we think there's going to be above-trend growth for 2026, fundamentals still look solid, that credit is something that can continue to stay on the table for most investors, I think. Paul, on implementation, if an investor wants global exposure but also wants to stay nimble, how would you suggest that they go about building that into a portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's a great question because I think everything we've talked about is -- the fixed income's attractive, but it's going to be more nuanced. There's going to be more volatility around that. I think that's actually the benefit of a global fixed income approach is that you can allocate capital relatively quickly between the sectors, between countries, and to different parts of the yield curve should opportunities arise. I think for us, that says have a broad approach. It says allow flexibility, but flexibility within bands or within bounds, we obviously have ranges that we will look to allocate to duration to curve to different countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the key here is that we need to think about every part of the market separately and look at how they trade relative to each other and look at those opportunities. As I said before, we need to really understand that even in places like Europe, it's a collection of different countries. When we think about Asia, it's a collection of different countries, and there will be opportunities coming across there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the key part here is this is a liquid market. This is public bonds. They're liquid. We can reallocate capital really quickly, and we can redeploy as opportunities arise. Really, why do we see this global universe as being a natural part of investors' asset allocation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Maybe just one final follow-up there. Tell us where emerging markets fit into this discussion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> As I alluded to before, I think emerging markets have been in a slightly different cycle to developed markets. One could say that emerging markets reacted to the inflation threat a lot earlier than developed markets. Now granted, their inflation basket is very different to developed markets, but they reacted earlier, they tightened policy earlier, and that means that they're in a slightly different place in the cycle. Emerging markets were also an asset class that saw, up until recently, net outflows. So there's not a lot of crowded positions there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're certainly starting to see a lot of opportunity in emerging markets from the fundamental side, from valuations, and from technicals. We're also starting to see clients reallocate capital to emerging markets as they search for added income. I would say that the valuation metrics for emerging markets relative to credit right now are still attractive</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Thank you very much for those comments. Paul, I can't let you go without a quick bonus question. Of course, the market environment is very volatile. So I'd like to know what you tend to do to help you reset and think clearly outside the office.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's a good question. I actually play quite a random, esoteric sport that many people on this podcast won't have heard of, called real tennis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Tell us more about real tennis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Real tennis is essentially Henry VIII's version of tennis. One of the few similarities is it has a ball, it has a net, and it has a racket. The differences are it's an enclosed court. You can play off any wall. There are certain hazards there, or nets that you can hit, that you get bonus points that automatically win the point. You also play with a wooden racket that is not symmetrical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would encourage anyone who's interested look it up online. It's completely random. The scoring is also relatively complicated as well. It is quite good to disconnect from work because you have to concentrate on trying to hit a ball that is hand-sewn, so it doesn't bounce the same way. The scoring is slightly random. I would say that it's -- you can either try and play the point or remember the score. It is something that...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar: </strong>You can't do both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> You can't do both. It is something that requires a lot of concentration. It does mean that you switch off quite meaningfully from work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar</strong>: I love that. Thank you so much for sharing that. It's a fun fact about yourself. Paul, this is a great discussion today. Maybe just to quickly summarize a few of the comments that you said. You mentioned that investors shouldn't abandon US assets and follow that sell the US trade. Our conversation was really about the marginal allocation decisions that really are starting to matter more as markets and policy paths diverge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We talked about correlations that have come down, and the global fixed income opportunity set really looks more differentiated than it has in recent years. We talked about rotating capital and accessing dozens of countries and currencies to find income and diversification. You've talked about some of the views that the fixed income team has at the moment, at Neuberger, overweight Europe versus the US, where there could be potential mispricing from the ECB. You also highlighted Japan as an area that's attractive due to the valuation opportunity and the steep yield curve there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, finally, hopefully, I'm summarizing this fairly, that in an environment of tight spreads, the combination of income diversification flexibility plus the ability to be nimble when those dislocations appear can be especially valuable for investors. Hopefully, I summarized that okay for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's absolutely perfect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Paul, once again, thank you so much for being on the show, and good luck in your next real tennis match.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger: </strong>Thank you very much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This communication is provided for informational and educational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security.

The performance<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in the past year and a bit more has not been great in terms of total returns compared to competition. However, a deeper look at its structure reveals a long term structural edge many of the more popular income alternatives miss - that is a strong drawdown protection layer.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total returns suffer a bit because of the protective put layer, but it shifts the risk reward asymmetry favorably. KHPI may appear weak in strong rallies like we saw in 2025. But whenever markets consolidate, its aggressive covered call writing strategy ensures potential income even when positive trends are missing. Overall, I find KHPI as a strong income contender for long term investors (due to the protective put layer), and especially for a flatter 2026 market (due to a more aggressive covered call layer).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What the Protective Put Does</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A <a href=\"https://www.kensingtonassetmanagement.com/solutions/etfs-khpi/#performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">look at the KHPI portfolio</a> reveals how it is set up and also reveals a key differentiator that tilts the long term risk reward balance. As of February 25, 2026, the portfolio holds ~502k VOO shares. This is ~$315m at current VOO prices and close to KHPI's AUM. That is, the portfolio is fully deployed on the S&amp;P 500 with little surplus remaining to invest in treasuries or money market funds - something several peer S&amp;P 500 covered calls ETFs do, using synthetic option based exposure routes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio shows around 457 SPX put contracts. Since the S&amp;P 500 is at ~6900 now, each contract is worth ~$$690k (100 multiplier per contract). The notional coverage of this option spread layer is therefore ~$315m - almost exactly the size of the underlying holdings. This option layer is ~6% away from current spot levels and ensures that drawdowns beyond ~6% are capped, and since coverage is for the entire portfolio, this protection completely limits big drawdowns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means if there is a crash by say 20%, KHPI limits its drawdown to only ~6%. However, if the S&amp;P 500 is down by only 4%, KHPI does not visibly show any material protective benefit. The hedge is for extreme events and often does not show its true value in most market scenarios, especially when the going is smooth like now (and in 2025). But from a risk reward balance perspective, it alters the profile of the income plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most income focused covered call strategies generally prioritize income generation and upside capture, which means the protective put is missing and drawdown mitigation due to an option layer and premiums thereof are limited. That is if the S&amp;P 500 is down by 20%, you may very well see SPYI down by 17-18% - a lesser impact, but a fixed 2-3% protection. The open downside structure works out well in a long term bullish scenario, but the ride is often more volatile during rare crashes. By limiting crash possibilities, KHPI actually converts the total return charts into a lower return lower risk vehicle - not a bad outcome for income investors. The upside is limited because there is a cost of protection. While SPYI and GPIX often track the S&amp;P 500 with minimal drag, KHPI may be far slower in total return terms, but saves a lot more in 2020 or 2022 like crashes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glimpses of this downside protection were visible in the sharp but limited-time drawdowns of April 2025. You may see that gap even magnify further if the crash is deeper. This risk reward characteristic difference versus peers is a long term structural advantage, and remains always applicable, although invisible for large stretches of play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Aggressive Option Writing Layer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The option layer consists of a call spread layer with the short call almost at the money now and a buy call layer ~3% away. This layer holds around 457 SPX contracts. Like the put layer, this layer also translates to ~$315m, which means full coverage of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The balance of this covered call layer is important because there is a protective put layer to fund, while keeping the strategy net positive in income terms. KHPI achieves this balance by moving the protective put away (~6% away from spot as discussed before in today's setup. KHPI also aims to capture some sharp rallies too, which is why there is a buy call position ~3% away from the written call. The net effect of this setup is to ensure there is sufficient protection for more extreme drawdowns, while upsides are generally capped, but sharp upsides are somewhat captured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, if markets stay flat it will earn some premiums from an aggressive portfolio coverage (100% coverage unlike a lot of peer covered call ETFs) closer to spot, despite funding bought puts and calls further away from the strike. So, overall KHPI earns smaller but surer income when markets are consolidating such as now, and as expected for most of 2026. Income is maximized if there are sharp rallies, remain in play when markets consolidate. And for long term holders, any tail risk event is when KHPI resets and starts much higher in any ensuing rebound phase. The net effect of this setup is that KHPI's total returns are not as exciting as say a SPYI or a GPIX, but its aggressive option writing layer enables a protective element that should work out over full cycles. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This setup works very well for a 2026-like market where the sharp upside probability appears lower. We have a hedge against potential corrections and an income source for consolidation regimes. The loss in momentum in the S&amp;P 500 is already evident in the past 3-4 months and more of that slow grind up (or a flat regime) is likely to persist for a few more quarters. I have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872479-schgs-upgrade-engine-is-losing-steam-time-to-temper-expectations\">recently written</a> about how the markets are now re-evaluating the way they underwrite long duration risks. The AI-led rally that dominated 2024-25, will therefore likely see a phase where earnings grow into valuations and markets remain flat till another strong round of earnings revisions led by AI monetization emerges, and the capex drag dilutes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>A Strong Income Strategy</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KHPI's yield is currently high single digits - not too aggressive like in the case of some peer ETFs who may see higher NAV erosion over time as a lot of distributions are funded through a return of capital mechanism. The expense ratio is slightly high at ~0.96% compared to 0.68% in the case of SPYI and 0.29% for a more active strategy like GPIX. I checked the distribution characteristics across a few months (sample December breakdown <a href=\"https://www.kensingtonassetmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/KHPI-Fund-19a1-Notice-11.30.25-Confidential.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) and saw that distributions are predominantly labeled as return of capital. That is distributions are typically not taxed immediately, but their cost basis is reduced, which can defer taxes yet increase future capital gains if shares are sold - this is neutral to slightly positive for tax deferral, but not inherently free income.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KHPI's suitability for a long term income portfolio is high. Its setup is well poised for a more immediate term of consolidation as well. I rate KHPI as a Strong Buy for income focused investors - this on risk reward balance rather than total returns.</p>",

I'll discuss these fundamentals in the article below, and I hope that at the end of it, you'll agree that AVLV's active and balanced approach is deserving of a \"buy\" rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per its <a href=\"https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">website</a>, AVLV's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, though it does offer a modest 1.20% dividend yield that's in line with broad market funds like SPY. The website also provides a brief overview of the active strategy used, as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Invests in a broad set of U.S. large-cap companies and is designed to increase expected returns by focusing on firms trading at what we believe are low valuations with higher profitability ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Pursues the benefits associated with indexing (diversification, low turnover, transparency of exposures), but with the ability to add value by making investment decisions using information in current prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Efficiency portfolio management and trading process that is designed to enhance returns while seeking to reduce unnecessary risks and costs for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Built to fit seamlessly into an investor's asset allocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, AVLV is designed to be a high-quality, well-diversified fund that trades at favorable valuation ratios, and a quick glance at my latest factor scores confirms this description is reasonably accurate. As the table shows, AVLV's 44.3% concentration in its top ten sub-industries is quite low, and its 6.81/10 value score is the best of the four. Arguably, its 6.85/10 quality score could be better, but the counterpoint to that is that AVLV doesn't really have any significant gaps on any factor. That, along with its low 0.15% expense ratio, is the appeal, and it's why I labeled it an \"affordable all-weather large-cap value ETF\" two years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"220\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Factor Scores\" width=\"640\" height=\"81\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Compare Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CGDV and SPY have some gaps on the value and size factors, which explains why they've mostly missed out on this year's rotation. Meanwhile, VTV, like AVLV, also has good value and size factor exposure, but its 2.25/10 growth score could cause trouble if growth stocks rebound this year, and its 3.18/10 sentiment score suggests its holdings aren't delivering the kinds of earnings surprises required to sustain their recent price momentum.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Performance Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadly speaking, that's my fundamental take on each ETF, but before diving into the specific statistics that lead to these scores, I want to look at AVLV's performance. Unfortunately, in order to include CGDV in the analysis, I had to exclude AVLV's returns prior to March 2022 (seven months), but it should still be helpful in understanding the kinds of returns AVLV shareholders can expect in bull and bear markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1741\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Performance Statistics\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown, AVLV's 14.66% annualized returns since March 2022 ranked second best, as did its risk-adjusted returns (0.65 Sharpe Ratio) and downside risk-adjusted returns (0.98 Sortino Ratio). Its 17.57% standard deviation is slightly alarming, but its maximum drawdown and worst twelve-month figures were in line with VTV's, and that's something I believe is aided by its decent quality score. High-quality stocks, at least as I define them, have strong margins and high capital efficiency ratios, and it's my belief that these make them bounce back reasonably fast after market downturns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being resilient is a necessary part of AVLV's strategy because it's actually the only ETF in this group to have a single-month loss of more than 10% (-11.9% in June 2022). Fortunately, AVLV gained 8.1% the following month and 13.0% in October 2022, so its high standard deviation figure is simply a reminder that investors should be able to tolerate large price swings in both directions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Performance Returns Distribution Profile - Balanced\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Fundamental Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned, AVLV's strength is that it's fundamentally well-balanced, which is why I've included statistics covering each of the major factors for its top 20 holdings. Again, diversification is a strength, with just 43% allocated to these 20 stocks, but generally, I hope you'll agree that AVLV has very few weak spots right now, which is why it's such a good choice right now regardless of the market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1758\" data-height=\"921\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV Fundamental Analysis - Top 20 Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Snapshots Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, AVLV's five-year portfolio beta of 1.02 is a bit elevated for a large-cap value fund, especially compared to VTV's 0.85. However, I don't think that's too big of an issue for investors with a moderate time horizon, and if you're trying to decide between the two, I'd like to highlight AVLV's superior return on total capital (14.58% vs. 10.58%). This key capital efficiency ratio means AVLV's holdings rely less on external financing than VTV's, and it's worth noting that AVLV also holds the advantage on ROA (9.97% vs. 6.46%) and ROE (26.98% vs. 20.70%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV is the cheapest of the four funds based on its 20.55x and 17.38x trailing and forward P/E ratios. It also offers a decent three-year historical EPS growth rate of 7.79% and an 11.55% one-year estimated EPS, which, once again, are superior to VTV. While you can technically get better growth for the price with CGDV or SPY, that's not AVLV's purpose. In a rotation to value, investors focus more on valuation ratios than growth rates, and that's why \"cheap\" funds like AVLV and VTV are outperforming this year. Even ETFs with terrible portfolio-level growth rates, like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>), are doing well, but the difference is that AVLV at least offers moderate earnings growth.

In my opinion, that's appropriate for a core holding, and from a factor perspective, I don't see any major weaknesses worth flagging. Therefore, I've decided to reiterate my \"buy\" rating on AVLV, and I look forward to keeping the discussion going in the comments section below. Thank you for reading.</p>",

There are two segments within the company: Americas and International. The company has more than 13,000 employees around the globe and sports a current market cap just shy of $14B. As shown in the chart below, Allegion has underperformed the broad market, as measured by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>, by a significant margin over the past decade, returning less than 200%, while SPY has a total return north of 300%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quality Financial Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I believe there are three key quantitative metrics that all high-quality companies should possess: a growing revenue stream, stable margins, and a healthy return on invested capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The revenue per share for ALLE has grown at a solid pace over the past ten years, with 2020 providing the only down year, and it was minimal at just 3.3%. Following the pandemic, the RPS came back stronger, as it increased more than 8% in 2021 and climbed double-digits in 2022 (16%) and 2023 (11%). Since then it has continued to increase with a modest 4% rise in 2024 and another almost 10% jump last year. The revenue per share growth has been incredibly consistent, with 3-, 5-, and 10-year CAGRs all hovering between 8% and 9%, aided by management reducing the outstanding shares by approximately 10M over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gross profit margin has been relatively stable with some expansion mixed in. As indicated by the green line below, the GPM has typically lingered around the low 40s, with a chart low in 2022 a tick above 40%. Since that bottom point, this metric has climbed each year, achieving 43% in 2023, 44% in 2024, and more than 45% last fiscal year. The GPM expansion has stemmed from operational improvements, accretive acquisitions, and shedding non-core product lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final metric I want to look at is the return on invested capital, which is shown by the orange line on the chart. This metric has dwindled lower over the years, as it was at a chart high in 2018 at more than 20% before dipping to a low in 2020 of a still respectable 13.6%. Since then it's yet to eclipse the 20% mark again, coming in around 17% in 2023 and 2024 and just below 16% in fiscal 2025. I normally like to see an ROIC above 20%, and ideally ALLE will be able to surpass this target in the near future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"860\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE revenue per share RPS gross profit margin GPM return on invested capital ROIC\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Data</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past year, Allegion paid a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share; however, earlier this month, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547575-allegion-raises-quarterly-dividend-by-8-to-055share\">the company raised its dividend by 8%</a> to $0.55. Following this dividend hike, Allegion now pays a forward dividend yield of around 1.37%, about 17% lower than it was a year ago. The dividend growth has slowed over the years but still remains above inflation, as the 10-year CAGR sits at more than 17%, while the 3 and 5-year CAGRs are more in line with the recent increase. The payout ratio has hovered around 30% over the last half-decade, which should enable the company to easily continue to raise its dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"864\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE dividend per share DPS payout ratio\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last week Allegion announced their Q4 2025 results, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94, missing expectations by $0.04, on revenue of $1.03B, which also came up short of analyst estimates by about $5M. This revenue figure was a year-over-year increase of more than 9% overall and 3.3% organically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Americas segment posted a revenue jump of more than 6%, climbing from $750M to almost $800M, which was driven by a high-single-digit increase from the non-residential division. Strategic pricing and strong demand contributed to the success but were also aided by accretive acquisitions like Next Door Company and Trimco Hardware. Moreover, operating income also increased by over 6%, while the operating margin grew an immaterial amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the Americas segment posted solid figures, the international segment fared much better, with revenue jumping from $193.8M to $237.7M, a 21% surge. Much of this increase occurred due to acquisitions too, with ALLE acquiring Lemaar in Australia, UAP Group in the U.K., and ELATEC, which is a German business known for RFID readers. Favorable foreign exchange rates also boosted these results, delivering a positive effect of almost 8%. However, it's worth noting that organic revenue in this segment declined a little more than 2% due to weak demand for mechanical products. Lastly, the operating income in this segment soared more than 66% to around $30M, mostly due to the aforementioned acquisitions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also provided 2026 guidance, which projects organic revenue growth of 3% at the midpoint (compared to 4.1% in FY25), and total growth of 6% at the midpoint, supported by continued acquisitions and strong demand from the electronics business unit in the international market. Additionally, the company estimates 2026 earnings per share to be between $8.00 and $8.20, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the market was not fond of the earnings release, which can be read/listened to here, with shares tanking around 10%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final consideration is to determine if ALLE is trading for an attractive valuation at its current levels, and in order to do so, we'll examine it from a free cash flow perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To give a little more context, I estimate a stock's implied fair value based on its free cash flow yield and specifically how the current yield compares to its historical average. This helps me gauge how much investors have typically been willing to pay for a company's free cash flow and how attractive the stock looks today relative to that history. The analysis is calculated on 12 years of daily historical price data, capturing the rolling 5-year average free cash flow yield for the past 7 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key assumption behind this valuation model is that investors have paid a fair price for the stock over the past 5 years, on average. However, since every valuation is an estimate, there is a +/-10% margin of error applied to the fair value range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1456\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE free cash flow valuation free cash flow/price free cash flow/p fcf/price fcf/p\" width=\"640\" height=\"376\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my custom valuation model, shares of Allegion look to be trading for a moderate discount to their fair value, with a current price of about $158 and an estimated fair value slightly above $170. The company has seen strong free cash flow growth since 2023, when it jumped 30%, and 2024 and 2025 incurred double-digit increases, leading to the rise in valuation zones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimated long-term expected rate of return for Allegion is a healthy 11.14%, with the components of that figure coming from a forward dividend yield of 1.31%, a return to fair value factor of 1.92%, and an approximate future earnings growth rate of near 8%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, Allegion has performed well for itself over the past ten years but has come up short compared to the overall market. The company has some encouraging financials, with robust revenue per share growth, expanding margins, and a pretty consistent return on invested capital. The dividend has been paid and raised for over a decade, with stable dividend growth just shy of 10%. The recent earnings report was not well-received by the market, but it might've given investors a potentially good entry point.</p>",

I've maintained that bullish outlook since the company's IPO. Even though I acknowledge that my January buy call was ill-timed (I certainly wasn't predicting the sharp selloff in tech that would ensue), my thesis on Figure remains sound. I view the company as an incredibly differentiated innovator in the blockchain that is poised to displace and take market share from incumbent lenders: not just in mortgage originations, but now in auto financing as well. I reiterate my <strong>buy </strong>rating here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure's immense growth within its existing consumer loan marketplace is astounding (more detail in the next section), but what investors should be aware of today is the fact that the company is planning a broad extension of its platform in 2026. Figure built its platform and its name brand around one type of loan, the HELOC (home equity line of credit). But in itself, HELOC loans are relatively niche product that form a very small share of overall borrowing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2026, the company is focused on expanding two loan types. The first is primary, first-lien mortgages. Already, the company is showcasing tremendous growth in first lien, with volumes rising roughly 3x y/y in the fourth quarter to $506 million. Still, first lien (standard mortgages) represents only 19% of the company's origination volume. Figure's management also notes that it typically is able to issue a standard mortgage with a total cost of under $1,000 (thanks to automating many manual portions of the underwriting process, and with higher credit accuracy) versus an industry average of $11,045, marking a clear advantage for lenders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2320\" data-height=\"1202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure first lien issuance trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"332\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure first lien issuance trends <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next expansion area is completely beyond housing. Figure has <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/agora-data-partners-with-figure-to-tokenize-auto-loans-93CH-4529801\" rel=\"nofollow\">struck a partnership</a> with a company called Agora Data, which describes itself as an AI-powered intelligence platform for auto loan originators to predict performance of subprime auto loans and to connect lenders to capital. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Agora gives Figure easy access to its base of auto lenders, marking its first foray into an auto lending TAM that is sized at a staggering $1.6 trillion. While Agora's platform is responsible for origination in this deal (which is Figure's role in home loans), Figure's role is to use its newly-launched Figure Connect to tokenize these loans into assets on the blockchain: which makes it easier and less costly for auto loan originators to securitize and sell their loans using the Figure platform. In my view, it's an excellent expansion of Figure's use cases, and a great utilization of Figure Connect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2318\" data-height=\"1086\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure auto lending\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure auto lending <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, with so many tailwinds ahead for Figure in 2026, there is little reason for this stock to crash post-earnings. Take advantage of the dip as a buying opportunity.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Download</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now go through Figure's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"1202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure Q4 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"602\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"602\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure Q4 results <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure's revenue grew 91% y/y to $159.9 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $157.7 million (+88% y/y) by three-point margin. Important to note is the fact that Figure's revenue accelerated sharply from just 55% y/y growth in Q3. Similar to the prior quarter, Figure's y/y surge in revenue was driven primarily by Figure Exchange, the company's crypto trading platform which launched in midway through 2024 (revenue recorded in the \"ecosystem and technology fees\" line. Still, we note that crypto trading is only one-quarter of the company's overall revenue (despite now having negative associations with the crypto sector that has brought down Figure's stock tremendously). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core lines of business, meanwhile, also thrived. The chart below showcases the company's main business driver: the amount of loans originated through the company's platform. Consumer loan marketplace volume surged 131% y/y to $2.71 billion in Q4, which accelerated versus just 63% full-year growth across the entirety of FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1274\" data-height=\"332\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure loan volumes\" width=\"640\" height=\"167\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"167\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure loan volumes <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, it's the expansion of loan types that is potentially feeding growth acceleration here, as the company focuses more on first-lien originations (which not only is a larger market than home equity lines, but also tend to have higher loan balances). The company's 2026 foray into auto loans should only serve to add fuel to recent growth trends. We note as well that Figure's take rates (its revenue as a percentage of origination volume) jumped 30bps y/y to 3.8%, which is a major tailwind for revenue growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue from the company's loan servicing arm grew 30% y/y to $9.0 million, while loan originations grew 65% y/y to $22.4 million. We focus on these core lending activities because they are Figure's \"bread and butter\" and provide recurring revenue for the company, even if Figure Exchange's crypto trading results become choppier heading into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, Figure's adjusted EBITDA grew roughly 5x y/y to $81.3 million, representing a 51.6% margin that improved more than 30 points y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1288\" data-height=\"902\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"448\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"448\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure adjusted EBITDA <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has a near-term goal of hitting 60% adjusted EBITDA margins, which it's driving via a greater mix of capital-light, third-party loans as well as efficiencies and automation applied to the company's own overhead. Per CFO Minchung Kgil's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875872-figure-technology-solutions-inc-figr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Our medium-term goal for adjusted EBITDA margin is to be above 60%, and our progress this quarter can be explained as follows: First, we are growing volume and assets in Figure Connect and democratized Prime that reduce balance sheet usage and improve contribution margins as more volume moves into our capital-light marketplace. Second, we are seeing our contribution margin from partner-branded volume continue to be around 80% as we have built out the core infrastructure that powers Figure Connect and our partner-branded initiatives. And third, we continue to execute on operating leverage across both fixed and variable expense categories, where our volume increased 131% and our operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation, increased 13% over the same period.\"</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Key Takeaways</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its rapid growth opportunities, we find that Figure also remains attractively valued. For most of last year, Figure traded at unjustifiable multiples of its bottom line; and now, after its stock price sank, we can no longer say the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, Figure takes at roughly <strong>18x forward adjusted EBITDA. </strong>An exact peer set for Figure is tough since its business is so unique, but Figure trades in line with a number of adjacent peers. Coinbase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>), which is the number-two crypto exchange, trades at similar ~17x adjusted EBITDA levels to Figure after its recent selloff. Another interesting direct competitor in home lending is legacy incumbent Rocket Mortgage (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RKT\" title=\"Rocket Companies, Inc.\">RKT</a>), which recently purchased Mr. Cooper and Redfin to become a one-stop shop consisting of a real estate brokerage, a mortgage originations platform, and a mortgage servicing arm. Against all of these peers, however, none can match Figure's ~2x y/y top-line growth and its incredible margin expansion trends.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stay long here and use the post-earnings dip as a buying opportunity.</p>",

The company's AI GPUs are clearly gaining traction in adoption and that's showing up in their financial performance. With long term tailwinds in place and their near term guidance looking quite solid, the major contraction in the valuation presents investors with a huge opportunity to enter or to add to positions. While there are some risks like the memory shortage and CPU supply concerns, I believe AMD has become a no-brainer once more.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Remains Strong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f506e0a50c585c68e73afd24a06594bb.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f506e0a50c585c68e73afd24a06594bb.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f506e0a50c585c68e73afd24a06594bb.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f506e0a50c585c68e73afd24a06594bb.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's start off with a look at their 2025 Q4 top line results. In the quarter, AMD generated record revenues of $10.3 billion and that represents a growth rate of 34% YoY. You can see above that this represents a slight deceleration from the previous quarter but there is no question that their business as a whole continues to see strong momentum. <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/db/841/9223/presentation/AMD+Q4%2725+Earnings+Slides+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMD stated that they</a> saw strong demand in their Data Center and Client and Gaming segments. The company was also able to smash expectations. They <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings\">beat analyst consensus</a> by a whopping $599.73 million. With their quarterly revenue just above $10 billion, this is a huge statement of outperformance. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data Center Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"787\" data-height=\"428\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data Center\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's no question that the data center segment remains the point of focus in AMD's earnings. As shown above, they reported revenues of $5.4 billion and that was a 39% increase YoY. This is a sharp speedup of growth <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/news/2025-11-04_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2025_Financial_1265.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from Q3's 22% growth rate</a> and so it seems this all-important business is gaining momentum. Despite worries about stiff competition from other GPU suppliers like Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and ASICs designers like Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), AMD seems to be holding its ground nicely. At CES, the company also unveiled their state of the art Instinct MI440X and so it is clear that their innovation is doing the talking. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before this latest earnings season, there were concerns that the hyperscalers will cut back on CAPEX with the payoff from these investments still being rather obscure. However, these worries were proven to be unfounded just recently. In their latest earnings report earlier this month, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) announced that<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548486-amazon-shocked-wall-street-with-its-2026-spending-plan-which-companies-could-benefit\"> they will spend $200 billion</a>. This comes after Alphabet's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) estimate of $175 billion to $185 billion in capital spending for 2026 and so at this point, there really are no signs that the major cloud service providers are letting up on CAPEX. The competition in that space is fierce and for a GPU provider like AMD, the tailwinds are likely to be strong moving forward. In Q4, data center growth accelerated and there is no evidence that momentum will fade any time soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">International expansion is also top of mind for the company. By now it is no secret that India is becoming an increasingly vibrant center for AI development. About ten days ago, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552263-amd-deepens-india-push-with-tcs-in-bid-to-rival-nvidia\">it was announced that</a> AMD and Tata Consultancy Services will broaden their strategic partnership. As Preeti Singh of Seeking Alpha writes, they will</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>introduce AMD’s “Helios” rack-scale AI architecture in India, stepping up competition with Nvidia in one of the world’s fastest-growing technology markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the U.S. is of course AMD's largest and most important market, the company's strategic decision to look to international markets like India for growth is a smart one in my view. The recent AI summit in the country clearly shows they are becoming an important source of infrastructure demand as well as innovation. As stated, this also helps them to compete with Nvidia globally. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, AMD made headlines with their massive Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) deal just yesterday (Feb 24th). <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555727-amd-to-deploy-up-to-6-gw-of-ai-chips-for-metas-ai-infrastructure\">It was announced that</a> Meta will deploy up to 6 GW of Instinct chips to power their infrastructure and that this agreement is multiyear and multi-generation. Firstly, it is obvious that this is a major financial win for AMD. CFO Jean Hu stated that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We expect this partnership to drive substantial multi-year revenue growth and be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings per share, marking another significant step forward in delivering on our ambitious long-term financial model.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, this is another major vote of confidence regarding the competitiveness of AMD's GPUs. As stated earlier, there were worries regarding stiff competition from Nvidia and Broadcom. I believe this massive Meta deal shows that AMD's solutions have matured and are now a formidable alternative to the top chips out there right now. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability Is Solid</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"655\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profitability\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, it seems that AMD has controlled costs well. You can see above that their adjusted gross margin expanded by 3 percentage points YoY. This could also be a signal of increased competitiveness in their products and thus better pricing power. Regardless of where this gross margin strength is coming from, investors should obviously be encouraged.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the control of expenses, things perhaps could have been a little bit better. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased by 1 percentage point YoY. If you go to their income statement, you'll see that marketing, general and administrative expenses growth outpaced the R&amp;D expense increase and so corporate efficiency may be slightly weaker than desired. Still, with the gross margin strength being a major driver, operating margin still saw expansion of 2 percentage points to show that AMD remains a generally well run business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, for the bottom line, the company posted an adjusted EPS of $1.53, up 40% YoY. This outpaced the top line growth rate and beat analyst expectations by $0.21 and so there really shouldn't be many complaints regarding their profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1164\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD provided guidance for their 2026 Q1. For revenue, they are expecting to see around $9.8 billion at the midpoint. This implies<a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/news/2025-05-06_AMD_Reports_First_Quarter_2025_Financial_1247.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a YoY growth rate of 32%.</a> While that is another modest deceleration of growth from Q4 levels, I would say that this is still enough to show that business activity will remain robust for the company as a whole moving forward. Furthermore, it should be stated that they guided revenue ~$430 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546578-earnings-snapshot-amd-posts-record-q4-results-beating-analysts-consensus\">above consensus expectations</a> and so the outlook looks quite good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For gross margin, they are projecting 55% and that would be an improvement from 54% in the year ago quarter. Therefore, the cost control and pricing power strength we talked about earlier is set to continue. Lastly, for operating expenses, they see around $3.05 billion for Q1. That represents a 38% jump. Since this outpaces the estimated top line growth rate, expect expense control to be mixed relatively speaking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a whole, I view the near term outlook quite favorably, but investors should really focus even more on the increasingly strong long term growth story for their data center segment. Note on their earnings call, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546760-amd-outlines-path-to-60-percent-annual-data-center-growth-and-multi-billion-ai-revenue-by\">CEO Lisa Su stated that </a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We are well positioned to grow Data Center segment revenue by more than 60% annually over the next 3 to 5 years and scale our AI business to tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD's forward P/E ratio has more than halved from the late 2025 peak. At a current reading of just 31.87, I believe the stock has reached bargain levels again. In today's article, it was shown that the company as a whole is performing well. In the in-depth look at their data center segment it was shown that growth is accelerating and recent developments are favorable. Hyperscalers are upping their spending, AMD's push into India is well justified, and the Meta deal is of course a big deal. No pun intended. With the near term outlook looking quite solid and long term tailwinds being strong, I view the company's fundamentals as robust and the prospects as being bright.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, the forward P/E ratio's rather sharp contraction over the past few months is really a sign of irrational worry and concern. AMD has the numbers, the contracts, and partnerships to show that they have become a force to be reckoned with instead of being a distant competitor to Nvidia and Broadcom. As a result, I view the current valuation as highly opportunistic.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some risks that investors should have in mind. Firstly, by now it is no secret that the tech sector is feeling the effects of a memory chip shortage. Do note that while AMD's data center segment has taken virtually all the spotlight, the company also has a large Client and Gaming business. There are worries that the memory chip shortage could potentially weigh on PC sales and other consumer electronics. For AMD, since they do still have a good amount of exposure to this space, their company-wide financial performance may still be adversely effected even if their data center segment booms. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential risk <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548407-intel-amd-notify-customers-in-china-of-lengthy-waits-for-cpus-reuters\">is CPU shortages</a> for the Chinese market. Earlier this month it was reported that both Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) and AMD had to notify Chinese customers that there were shortages and that deliveries had to be pushed back. For AMD specifically, delivery lead times for select products were pushed back 8 to 10 weeks. Obviously, this has the potential to have near term impacts to their business activity in one of the world's largest markets for CPUs. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in April of last year, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bay-area-ideas/analysis?ticker=amd\">I called AMD stock a no-brainer.</a> I believe the company has earned that title back. In today's analysis, it was shown that they are seeing a great deal of momentum in their all-important data center segment. Growth is accelerating and new deals clearly show that they have become a true major GPU supplier instead of being just a challenger on the outside looking in. While the prospects are arguably as bright as ever, the valuation has more than halved since the peak in late 2025 and so the attractiveness of the stock has increased immensely despite the risks highlighted above. As a result, I have decided to upgrade AMD to a strong buy rating.</p>",
