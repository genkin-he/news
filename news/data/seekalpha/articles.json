Still, I argued that in the long term, I see Visa delivering better results due to several key differences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, things have developed as I thought, but it hasn't been too meaningful to affect results. However, I think that from now on, the case for Visa over Mastercard will become stronger, and the recent quarter is a good example.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Differences Between Mastercard And Visa Are Set To Take Center Stage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's be honest, Mastercard and Visa are nearly identical businesses. Every time one of them comes up with a novel offering, the other immediately finds a way to offer the same thing. Recently, we saw this with <a href=\"https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html\" target=\"_blank\">agentic commerce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mastercard.com/mt/en/news-and-trends/stories/2025/mastercard-stablecoin-utility-and-scale.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.mastercard.com/mt/en/news-and-trends/stories/2025/mastercard-stablecoin-utility-and-scale.html\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, where do they actually differ?

Meanwhile, Visa <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/050606653/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Visa-Inc-Fourth-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/050606653/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Visa-Inc-Fourth-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">guided</a> for the high end of low-double-digit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we take their outlooks and translate them into numbers, I think we can assume Mastercard is expecting 17% revenue growth, or 12% organically, while Visa is expecting 13%-14% organic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the bottom line is Mastercard continues to deliver extraordinary numbers, but they are no longer more extraordinary than Visa's. In fact, in many areas, they are less extraordinary.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, what we saw in Q3 is going to continue. Currently, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">consensus</a> sees Mastercard growing revenues by 12% in 2026, while Visa is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V/earnings/estimates?period=annual\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V/earnings/estimates?period=annual\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to grow 11%. This would be the narrowest gap in a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, considering their CY26 multiples, Mastercard's premium of 15% is about in line with the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">historical average</a>, but it's not supported by the same growth gap, as we discussed.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its own, Mastercard trades at the high end of its historical valuation range, ahead of what's going to be a lower growth period (though still strong at low double digits).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my mind, considering all of the above, Mastercard trades at a fair valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mastercard remains one of the best companies I know of, and I believe that investors who hold it for the long term will benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I think that in Q3, we saw the growth lead over Visa at its lowest level, and I estimate the closing of the gap will continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This time, it will take center stage and be much more obvious for investors, as it will come down to actual results rather than future estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I can't recommend buying Mastercard here, at a sizeable premium, when Visa is a better prospect in my view. Therefore, I downgrade Mastercard to \"Hold.\"</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important clarification: I wouldn't sell Mastercard shares and replace them with Visa if there are meaningful capital gains involved. I do think Visa is meaningfully more attractive, but not to this extent.</p>",

This step raised the pro-forma net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3.7×, which worried the market. However, a substantial portion (approx. 5%) of the transaction was paid in CBIZ shares, subject to Marcum's management's commitment to work with the new entity for 4 years. This means the partners who built Marcum and its relationships now hold a meaningful equity interest in CBIZ, and their long-term incentives are tied to the merger's success, reducing the departure of talent and clients after the acquisition, which is a crucial detail often overlooked by the market, and significantly reduces the risks of the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2866\" data-height=\"200\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1\" width=\"640\" height=\"45\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2798\" data-height=\"120\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1\" width=\"640\" height=\"27\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBIZ is built for the middle market, focusing on medium-sized companies. Marcum deal doubles CBIZ's dominance in this stable and profitable market, which is the backbone of growth and employment in the U.S. economy. This segment tends to be more resilient in economic fluctuations. Besides, these types of companies are mostly too big for local small accounting firms, yet too small for large firms such as the Big Four.

CBIZ revenues from the insurance and benefits sector were stable, mitigating the intensity of seasonality. Following the acquisition deal, which doubles the size of the financial services sector, the combined profits are expected to be more seasonal, with a higher concentration in the first half of the year. Therefore, any investor who does not consider this point might worry about the results of the second half quarters, although this is merely a natural rhythm depending on the company's nature.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the company's <a href=\"https://ir.cbiz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cbiz-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-month-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.cbiz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cbiz-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-month-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">guidance</a>, it expects adjusted EBITDA of $450 million for 2025.

Considering the recent strong performance, low valuation compared to peers, and the company's repurchase of approximately 800,000 shares, which confirms the cheap stock price, it would be fair to give a \"Buy\" rating. However, investors should monitor debt repayment progress each quarter, as this is an essential event that will significantly reduce risks and lead to higher multiples.</p>",

Mostly not. IUS has a place in the cohort of ETFs I am constructive on, but nothing more. This is a Hold rating at best. Sure, as I have already said in the previous article, IUS is a good candidate for a quality investor's ETF shortlist, but it would clearly be an exaggeration to say that it has the potential to outperform the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) or the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>) in the current market conditions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basics of The Invesco RAFI™ Strategic US ETF</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Inception: September 12, 2018</li> <li>Investment Adviser: Invesco Capital Management LLC</li> <li>AUM: $689.01 million, as of October 30</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 0.19%</li> <li>5-Year Annualized Total Return (October 2020–September 2025): 17.45% vs. IVV's 16.45%</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IUS Strategy Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As explained on the Invesco <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/en/financial-products/etfs/invesco-rafi-strategic-us-etf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, the Invesco Strategic US Index, which \"...is designed to measure the performance of high quality, large-sized US companies,\" is the very core of IUS' passive strategy. The index is reconstituted just once a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has a selection and weighting process that I usually call sophisticated or labyrinthine—smart beta at its best. That is to say, the index provider goes very much beyond just picking the most expensive names in the market and assigning them weights depending on their market caps (this is almost what the S&amp;P 500 does, but of course with a lot of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794160-ivv-us-bellwethers-in-an-ultra-low-cost-etf-wrapper\">nuances</a>). Instead, it relies on the \"business-size score,\" which is the main instrument in deciding whether a company has quality high enough to qualify for the index. As described by IUS:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The securities are assigned a business-size score based on the equally-weighted average of sales, operating cash flow, total return of capital and book value over the prior five years or life of the security. For real estate securities, operating cash flow is replaced by funds from operations and book value is replaced by total assets. The securities are then assigned a quality score based on the equally-weighted average of efficiency (ratio of sales-to-assets in the prior year) and growth (percentage change in ratio of sales-to-assets over the prior five years or life of the security). Finally, each eligible security is ranked in descending order by its Business-Size score. For inclusion in the index, securities ranked in the top 90% by Business-Size score are eligible and, of those 80% with the highest Quality score. Securities in the Index are weighted based on their float-adjusted Business-Size scores.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IUS Performance: Good At Mitigating Losses, But Bad At Capturing Upside</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incepted in September 2018, IUS has had a quite mixed performance, with grossly successful years followed by rather soft ones. So beating IVV and IWB (I have added the latter ETF as the Russell 1000 Index is IUS' benchmark as per the factsheet, and IVV is a market proxy that I use in my ETF research) was not something its business-size score-centered strategy was potent enough to accomplish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it still should be noted that it has outperformed such quality factor-focused peers as the Fidelity Quality Factor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FQAL\" title=\"Fidelity Quality Factor ETF\">FQAL</a>), the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QUAL\" title=\"iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF\">QUAL</a>), and the JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JQUA\" title=\"JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF\">JQUA</a>), though the Invesco S&amp;P 500® Quality ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPHQ\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500® Quality ETF\">SPHQ</a>) was racier.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Annual Performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Delving deeper, we see that IUS outperformed IWB and IVV only in October–December 2018, 2021, and 2022.

the 2022 loss was just 8.35%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, its maximum drawdown over the period was 22.65% (the one it delivered in March 2020), which of course does not look comfortable at all, but almost all ETFs in the group (JQUA is an exception) still delivered much deeper drawdowns (for most, the deepest drawdowns were in 2022, not 2020).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, while this clearly speaks in its favor, I do not think this is enough for a Buy thesis as there are other facts to consider.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Its annualized return over the period was weaker than those of IVV, IWB, and SPHQ.</li> <li>It was more volatile than SPHQ, JQUA, and FQAL, as illustrated by the standard deviation.</li> <li>Its upside capture ratio was just 94.53% (compared to, for instance, 100.85% of QUAL), which means it is quite weak at benefitting from tech-, growth factor-, and AI enthusiasm-driven bull markets like the one the S&amp;P 500 is currently in.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IUS Portfolio Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of October 29, there were 544 common stocks, REITs, and ADRs in the IUS portfolio, key among them being Alphabet Inc.

Importantly, there are only Class A shares in this portfolio, and Class C shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) are absent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A massive 91.6% of IUS' net assets is allocated to S&amp;P 500 constituents. However, as a result of the ETF's focus on the business-size score, most of these names are value or value-ish stocks, as I will explain shortly.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Parameter</td> <td><strong>IUS</strong></td> <td>IVV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stocks present in both IUS and IVV portfolios</td> <td><strong>91.76%</strong></td> <td>94.71%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Calculated by the author using data from the ETFs</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Ten Holdings</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the cohort of the key ten holdings, we see that IUS has significantly underweighted the locomotives of the bull market like NVIDIA Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), while significantly boosting exposure to the old-economy names like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Financial data as of October 30</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me summarize a few essential takeaways.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IUS is a solid choice for value investors who would not compromise on quality. Indeed, a combination of a weighted average adjusted earnings yield of 4.54% and a nearly 95% allocation to companies with a B- Quant Profitability rating or higher makes an impression.</li> <li>Low volatility-focused investors should appreciate the weighted average 24-month beta of its portfolio of 0.9.</li> <li>However, for growth and momentum investors (and the S&amp;P 500 is in the bull market driven by these exact factors), IUS has little to offer (a close to 2x difference in the weighted average forward growth rates of IUS and IVV is telling).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, the Invesco RAFI™ Strategic US ETF is certainly a decent investment vehicle with healthy returns secured by its carefully calibrated strategy. Alas, 'healthy returns' and consistent outperformance are not the same. Sure, IUS has proved that it can deliver more comfortable maximum drawdowns than most of its peers, but beating IVV systematically is certainly not what it can do. So, while appreciating its quality characteristics, I maintain the Hold rating.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIVB\" title=\"Civista Bancshares, Inc.\">CIVB</a></span>) in April 2025, the stock price has declined by around 4%. Also, since then, the company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20162913-civista-bancshares-inc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-the-farmers-savings-bank-launches\">announced</a> a new public offering of its shares<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank. These two transactions are not big, but they will have a material dilution effect on per-share items. To update my earnings estimates and investment thesis, I’m going to start by looking at the company’s balance sheet and earnings potential.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Acquisition, Pipelines to Counter Risks from Tariffs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loan growth over the last two quarters has been even worse than I’d imagined in my last report on the company, which I wrote in April. The net loan balance at the end of September was 0.3% lower than the balance at the end of March 2025. The management blamed “a bunch of expected payoffs” for the performance in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832689-civista-bancshares-inc-civb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a>. Further, the management said that it wasn't aggressive in trying to bring new business into the bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is hope for a recovery, partly because the loan pipelines are strong. The management mentioned in the conference call that the current pipeline is higher than it was last year, and significantly higher than it was earlier in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Civista Bancshares is on track to close the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank in November. Farmers operated in Northeast Ohio and had around $104 million in net loans at the time when the transaction was announced, as per a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20162913-civista-bancshares-inc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-the-farmers-savings-bank-launches\">press release</a>. This acquisition can boost the loan balance by around 3.4% in the last quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A threat to loan growth is the US trade policy. Civista Bancshares mostly operates in Ohio, whose economy is affected to a significant degree by US-Canada relations. According to the <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/map/state-benefits/oh\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Trade Representative</a>, around 35% of Ohio’s exports went to Canada in 2024. To put this in perspective, only around 15.8% of the US’s exports go to Canada, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/topyr.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Census Bureau</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the US-Canada relations have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks. The US President has announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods after recent advertisements by Ontario’s Premier showing President Reagan arguing against tariffs, according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ljgrm78zo\" rel=\"noopener\">news reports</a>. However, the Senate has voted to repeal the tariffs on Canada, according to the latest <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5577345-live-updates-trump-south-korea-government-shutdown/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">news reports</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management mentioned in the conference call that it is targeting mid-single-digit loan growth going forward. Considering the acquisition, the pipelines, and the risks related to tariffs, I’m expecting the loan book to grow by 4.0% in 4Q’25, which will take the full-year loan growth to 4.5%. Further, for 2026, I’m expecting loan growth of 4.1%. In addition, I’m assuming deposits will grow in line with loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet Forecast\" width=\"529\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"529\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data from SEC Filings, Analyst's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Acquisition, Rate Cuts to Lift the Margin</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the net interest margin grew by an impressive 28 basis points in the first half of this year, it fell by 6 basis points in the third quarter of the year. This fall wasn’t unexpected, and I’m not worried about it. There is a chance of net interest margin growth in the next couple of quarters, albeit by only a small amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management mentioned in the conference call that the margin could expand by 5 basis points in 4Q’25 due to Fed funds rate cuts and the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond 4Q’25, I’m expecting further margin expansion because I’m expecting 50 basis points of Fed funds rate cuts in 2026. Civista Bancshares’ deposit cost is quite rate-sensitive, as interest-bearing demand, savings, and money market deposits made up around 48% of total deposits. These deposits can be repriced soon after rate cuts. Hence, the deposit cost will fall as market interest rates decline, leading to margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m expecting the net interest margin to rise by 5 basis points in 4Q’25 and then by 6 basis points in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expecting the Efficiency Ratio to Worsen</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from giving small boosts to the loan balance and net interest margin, the acquisition will also benefit earnings through cost savings. The management mentioned in the conference call that it expected to make cost savings through the system conversion, which will reduce contract expenses. Further, the management is planning staff reduction following the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Civista Bancshares has shown remarkable expense discipline so far this year. The efficiency ratio improved to 64.1% in 3Q’25 from 71.9% in 3Q’24. Tariffs and their impact on inflation can raise the efficiency ratio in the future. However, the Fed Chair did note that, “I think it would not be appropriate to just ignore or assume away the inflation issue; at the same time, I think the risk of higher, more persistent inflation has declined significantly since April,” according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-in-fog-it-heads-toward-another-rate-cut-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"noopener\">news reports</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the benefits from the acquisition and tariff threats, I’m expecting the efficiency ratio to rise to 66% in 2026 from 64.1% in 3Q’25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expecting EPS of $2.6 for 2025 and $2.5 for 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time I last wrote about Civista Bancshares in April, the company had yet to announce its plans for an acquisition and a new public offering of shares. Under the public offering, Civista Bancshares’ shares outstanding increased by 3,788,238 shares, or 25%, according to details given in the earnings release. As a result, my previous report and the earnings estimate I gave in it are outdated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m now expecting the earnings per share to dip from the level seen in the first nine months of 2025, mostly because of the dilution effect of the new share issuance. The net income (not per share) will likely be higher because of low loan growth and slight margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m also assuming the non-interest income will remain rangebound after a small acquisition-related jump in 4Q’25. Further, I’m assuming the provision expense to loan ratio will remain near a normal level of 0.03% after spiking in 4Q’25 due to the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m expecting Civista Bancshares to report an EPS of $0.56 per share in 4Q’25, which will take full-year earnings to $2.60.

Civista Bancshares also offers a dividend yield of 3.1% at a quarterly dividend rate of $0.17 per share. Adding the price upside to the dividend yield gives a total expected return of 14.7%. Hence, I’m upgrading Civista Bancshares to a buy rating from my previous rating of hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s earnings per share are set to decline, and my valuation analysis shows that the market has overreacted to the EPS outlook. It seems the market has discounted Civista Bancshares too much in light of the expected EPS decline. I believe Civista Bancshares should trade higher, and a buy rating is appropriate for the stock.</p>",

The BDC last declared a quarterly cash dividend of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4478091-great-elm-capital-declares-0_37-dividend\">$0.37 per share</a>, kept unchanged from its prior distribution, and $1.48 per share annualized for a 19.6% dividend yield. This yield has moved up to its highest ever level on the back of common shares that have lost around 31% of their value since the start of the year. Bulls would be right to highlight that the common shares have dipped by around 33% since the news of the FBG bankruptcy, a rate that's more than 3x greater than the expected dip to net asset value (\"NAV\") that's expected from a total loss of the debt investment in FBG. The BDC's allocation to first lien debt is smaller than the broader BDC space at 47% as of the end of the second quarter, with CLOs the second largest allocation at 17% and a growing business for GECC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1808\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Portfolio Asset Mix\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net Asset Value Discount, NII, And Dividend Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Income Statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"145\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Form 10-Q</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GECC reported a second-quarter total investment income of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4477993-great-elm-capital-reports-q2-results\">$14.3 million</a>, a new quarterly record and up substantially by 50% from $9.5 million in its year-ago comp.

The gains were driven by NII and unrealized gains on its investment portfolio. Critically, while the surge in NII meant the company covered its base cash dividend by 138%, shareholders will need to dampen NII expectations for the whole year. GECC described the dividend income as being driven by a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808748-great-elm-capital-corporation-gecc-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">once-a-year dividend payment</a> on preferred shares of an insurance-related investment.

This type of dilution, when its common shares are swapping hands at such a steep discount to NAV, heightens the dip of the common shares. The BDC's shares outstanding is up at least 52% over the last 3 years, a pace of dilution that's annualized at 17%. This would form a core reason to not buy the stock, with the ticker being rated as a hold.</p>",

Based on the stock reaction, so does the market.</p> <p>After all the noise about a new Spotify (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPOT\" title=\"Spotify Technology S.A.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPOT</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) deal, revenue growth remains underwhelming, and margins continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, this is another quarter with no meaningful progress on things <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808225-universal-music-group-why-shares-stuck-what-needs-change\">that need to change</a> for the stock to deliver market-beating results. And, a Nasdaq listing won't change that.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Background</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've been covering <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/yr-research/analysis?ticker=UMGNF\">Universal Music</a> on Seeking Alpha for several years. After their IPO, the music fan in me couldn't be more excited to have a stake in the works of amazing <a href=\"https://www.universalmusic.com/for-umg-artists/\" rel=\"nofollow\">artists</a> like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Drake, and so many more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond my love of music, I thought UMG was going to be a great investment. It has an extremely wide moat in the form of its unparalleled catalog and relationships with artists. Also, it should be a resilient, fast-growing business with constantly improving margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_7835e62d0289ccd8f05d7fd35932f1ee.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over time, it became clear that things aren't progressing according to the plan.

Of course, Taylor Swift's \"The Life Of A Showgirl\" was the key driver of growth in this quarter, and that isn't something investors can depend on too much. Meanwhile, the core revenue lines in streaming and subscription were flat and up 8.7%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Universal Music Group, UMG, UMGNF, UNVGY, Results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"366\" height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53114293-17618459764097037.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Universal Music Group Q3'25 Press Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In publishing, the story is much better, as Digital revenue (comparable to subscription revenue for recorded music) was up 16.8% on a constant currency basis, and performance was up 17.3%.

Also, I don't think we can say that UMG is attractively valued when it trades at such a significant premium, even though it is growing faster and much larger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, as long as the EV / EBITDA / Growth multiple remains far above 1.5x, currently at 1.9x, the valuation is too high relative to the business prospects.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Universal Music Group closed off another quarter without meaningful acceleration. This is alarming, as the stock has been dead money for nearly five years. By definition, investors need to see a change in the fundamental story before they can expect better stock performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the new Spotify deal, it seems there is no structural change in the growth rate. With unpredictable margins and a relatively high valuation, I don't see a path to market-beating returns. That said, I don't think the downside is too extreme either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I reiterate a 'Hold' for UMG, and while I'm not short the stock, I encourage investors to allocate their money elsewhere due to opportunity costs.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As expected, given the high average gold price and gold/oil ratio during the quarter, the results were extremely good and included record-high quarterly cash flow.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company earned US$1.71/share during the quarter, which is US$6.84/share annualised. This means that despite this year’s large gain in its share price, NEM is being valued by the stock market at only about 12 times trailing earnings. We expect that it will be a similar story for most senior and mid-tier gold producers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further to comments in our lithium discussion earlier in today’s report, the fact that earnings are high and P/E ratios are low in the gold mining sector does not preclude the possibility that a long-term price top is forming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the contrary, in the commodity realm, financial results and valuations tend to be most inviting near the ends of bull markets. However, the signs that normally are seen near the end of a gold-mining bull market are not currently evident. Before we get to that, the long-term underperformance of gold mining stocks relative to gold bullion is worth a brief revisit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main reason that gold mining stocks, as a group, underperform gold bullion over the long term is that just as monetary inflation and the associated interest rate manipulation promote malinvestment in the broad economy, they do the same in the gold mining sector. The difference is that booms in the gold mining sector generally coincide with busts in the broad economy, and vice versa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an aside, don’t be misled by the performances of equity indices such as the SPX into thinking that the US economy is in the boom phase of the economic cycle. Due to the domination of passive investing, the performance of the stock market now has very little to do with the performance of the broad economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the US economy over the past few years, there have been booms in a small number of sectors, chief among them being AI and the related infrastructure, but the economy as a whole has been in the bust phase. Busts usually, but not always, culminate in a recession, with a surge in monetary inflation associated with the official response to the recession sowing the seeds of the next boom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the gold mining sector, the malinvestment that eventually stems from a boom involves ill-conceived acquisitions and project developments, the costs of which get written off years later during the bust phase. The result is wealth destruction over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A point we want to make today is that at this stage of the gold sector’s boom, there are no signs of widespread malinvestment. On the contrary, NEM and other large-scale gold producers still appear to be more focussed on cost reduction and cash-flow maximisation than on growth, especially ‘growth at any price’. This suggests to us that the end of the boom phase is not imminent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The end of the boom is not imminent, but the intermediate-term upward trend that began late last year is almost certainly over.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Which is why we've endeavored to create a number of funds around these resource, inflation hedge, and return vectors.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>WaterBridge Infrastructure</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>WaterBridge Infrastructure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBI\" title=\"WaterBridge Infrastructure LLC\">WBI</a>)</strong>, with a stock market value of $3.0 billion, —although only about $1 billion is traded—is the largest water-handling company in the U.S. This all but requires a dominant position in the Delaware Basin, the nation's most important and profitable oil-and-gas basin. A demonstration of the economic significance of this business, as de minimis as it might seem, is that if water takeaway activity is curtailed or stopped, then drilling must be curtailed or stopped, since about four barrels of water come up from the well with every oil-equivalent barrel. There must be a place to put it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A virtually identical company operating in the same area, <strong>Aris Water Solutions (ARIS)</strong>, was acquired two weeks ago by a natural gas pipeline company for $1.5 billion. WaterBridge's 2,500 miles of pipeline have produced water handling volumes of about 2.4 million barrels/day; Aris's water handling volume was 1.2 million barrels/day. These volumes will continue to expand, even if oil-and-gas volumes weren't to, because as wells either age or go deeper, the proportion of water produced rises. Of course, pricing can rise, too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If only a single inference-rich metric of this business were to be offered, a good one would be this: the revenue and operating margin in this business, per barrel of water, are about $0.85 and $0.45. This translates into a 51% operating margin—for a business that has yet to reach operating scale efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thinking about the extravagant scale of AI datacenter demand, and about the necessary localized electric power demand, and the necessary localized natural gas demand, and in turn about the required localized water demand... and then thinking about somehow getting exposure to this limiting factor at the end of that trillion-dollar chain of demand:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>If WaterBridge were somehow included in the S&amp;P 500, its index weight, if proportional to News Corp.'s $15 billion market cap and sub-one-basis point weight at the very bottom of the S&amp;P 500, then WaterBridge would have a weight of less than , or of one percent.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Tejon Ranch</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tejon Ranch </strong>is the largest contiguous private property, at 270,000 acres, in California. Located 60 miles north of Los Angeles, its largely undeveloped land includes 16 miles of frontage on either side of I-5, California's primary north-south roadway. The I-5 is the busiest in the nation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among other operating assets, the property includes 7 million sq. ft. of fully leased logistics terminals economically proximate to the Port of Los Angeles, and which is readily expandable. This year, residents moved into the first of three Tejon Ranch master-planned communities to be entitled. The company's strategy is to invest in getting land entitled for commercial and residential development, enhancing the land value with each step in that process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Land is <em>not </em>real estate, though it can become real estate. It certainly isn't a REIT, which is a debt-leveraged, financialized investment that can't compound adequately versus inflation, since it must issue more debt and/or equity in order to fund property acquisitions. If Tejon Ranch is a strategic type of asset, the price for it, in market cap, is $430 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>LandBridge Company</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>LandBridge Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LB\" title=\"LandBridge Company LLC\">LB</a>) </strong>controls a portfolio of 277,000 acres in the “core” of drilling activity in the Permian (Delaware) Basin. It was created in October of 2021 to procure land that is requisite for managing water infrastructure in that unique locale. Water infrastructure, unlike oil and gas, is not subject to eminent domain protections, despite water egress and disposal being an essential aspect of hydrocarbon extraction. This is to say, Texas landowners must provide easements (at reasonable rates) to oil and gas infrastructure providers to facilitate energy extraction; no such protection is granted to water infrastructure. The result is surface land being a highly strategic but still underappreciated asset in the energy industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates similar to a “triple-net” lessor. It incurs minimal expenses (operating and capital) related to the development of the land; it is the lessee—oh, say Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>)’s field operations team and potentially Microsoft’s contracted datacenter builder/manager—that bears that burden. In this way, consonant with a royalty business, higher water volumes, market capture and pricing all flow through to the shareholders in a capital efficient manner. The land position also facilitates exceptional returns on invested capital investment opportunities for water infrastructure developers, adding another growth vector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that this land is also proximate to various high-profile data center campus developments and is thus well-positioned to benefit from this development—at no incremental cost to the company. Optionality is so prized in the financial markets, and so many sophisticated and often probabilistically improbable strategies are pursued in its name—options, futures, leverage, <em>any </em>kind of technology, growth stock investing, IPO investing, venture capital—that it one almost hears resonant echoes of that old 1980 favorite by Johnny Lee [unfairly butchered to suit <em>this </em>venue]:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h3>Lookin' For Optionality</h3> <p>Well, I spent a lifetime lookin' for you</p> <p>... Playin' a fool's game, hopin' to win</p> <p>And tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again</p> <p>I was lookin' for optionality in all the wrong placesLookin' in too many facesSearchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces (oooh-oooh)Of what I'm dreamin' of...</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>San Juan Basin Royalty Trust</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SJT\" title=\"San Juan Basin Royalty Trust\">SJT</a>) </strong>is a natural gas royalty trust with 119,000 net acres in northwest New Mexico. It is relatively unusual as being a pureplay on natural gas, of which there are few. This one, at this time, also presents another predictive attribute, a transitory “problem” that provides an equity yield curve opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike a pure royalty, this trust is a “net profit interest” that receives payment net of the operator (Hilcorp) operating and capital costs. The trust is not obligated to provide capital for these costs, but they are deducted from distributions, and in the event of a deficit, accumulated until covered by net cash flows. In practice, there is an interest-free capital contribution arrangement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hilcorp increased the capital investment budget to $34 million in 2024, compared to $4.4 million in 2023, likely in response to a high realized gas price of $4.69/mcf in 2023. This did in fact result in a roughly 50% production increase, which was confounded by realized gas prices thereafter falling 56%. Accordingly, the Trust had amassed a capital deficit of over $20 million by the end of 2024. This resulted in the suspension of dividends, and an exodus of yield-oriented investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are various scenarios based on projected production volumes, capital spending levels and gas prices where the distributions will be reinstated and grow to material amounts. The gas reserves and production haven't gone anywhere and, if anything, run-rate production will be higher, meaning the essential value of the assets is intact. It's just a matter of waiting for the capital deficit to be erased by ongoing royalties, which is—and this is wonderful investment tool in such instances—just a matter of waiting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Altius Minerals Corp.</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Altius Minerals Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATUSF\" title=\"Altius Minerals Corporation\">OTCPK:ATUSF</a>) </strong>receives royalties from two miners that supply one-quarter of global potash and three-quarters of U.S. potash needs. Also copper and wind and solar project royalties. It's stock market value is $1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To repeat an earlier compare-an-contrast observation about pure size vs. undiluted economic participation in resource scarcity value: The combined market cap of those two miners (The Mosaic Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>) and Nutrien Ltd (N<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TR\" title=\"Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.\">TR</a>).), sometimes more profitable, sometimes less, is just under $40 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Mesabi Trust</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mesabi Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSB\" title=\"Mesabi Trust\">MSB</a>) </strong>holds a royalty interest on the Northshore (iron ore) Mine in the Mesabi Range in northern Minnesota. The mine operator is Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLF\" title=\"Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.\">CLF</a>) , an integrated iron and steelmaking company. The mine produces a specific type of high-grade iron ore that is a critical input material for electric arc furnace steelmaking. Cliffs has oriented its domestic growth strategy around electric arc furnaces and is thus highly sensitive to producing the requisite feedstock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The royalty agreement dates to 1961. The terms have never been in question until recently. Cliffs decided that it did not want to pay a royalty related to the “premium” for the high-grade ore. An arbitration panel resoundingly agreed with the Trust and awarded $72 million in residual payments in late 2024. However, the parties are now back in front of an arbitration panel for a related issue subsequent to the ruling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Cliffs attempt to circumvent the royalty agreement obscures a highly valuable iron royalty stream with decades of remaining—and low cost—reserve life. It's not difficult to calculate the current cash flow yield assuming historical mine production levels, current iron prices and the contracted premium. Fortunately, few other investors appear to take the time.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>Important Disclosures</p> <p>Past performance is not indicative of future results.

We spent so much time on them because<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> there's a payoff: In gold, the phenomenon of localized inflation is already apparent, but the other extractive industries will eventually have the same experience.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The financial markets won't help these companies either. Extraction-based commodity production is very capital intensive, but it is exceedingly difficult for producers to attract significant equity capital, because they can't compete with the need to raise fantastic amounts of capital for data centers and artificial intelligence projects. Would you be more likely to answer the phone for a chance to invest in: A) an iron ore mine with a payback period beginning in 10 years; or B) a datacenter developer that's up and running in a few? With little or no equity capital available to them, there's not much chance for mining companies to address a supply deficiency even if they perceive a long-term demand opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This raises three lines of related thought relative to portfolio positioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One is that future <em>localized inflation </em>can often be anticipated with a high degree of confidence. We've seen to what great effect that understanding can be put, using the appropriate asset-light vehicle. All that's required is patience for the compounding to manifest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second thought is that <em>scarcity value </em>can magnify the return possibilities of a localized inflation beneficiary. While Sabine Royalty (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBR\" title=\"Sabine Royalty Trust\">SBR</a>) was an astoundingly more successful beneficiary of higher oil prices and inflation than an actual extraction company like Exxon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>), scarcity value was not one of the attributes of its superior performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The additional attribute of scarcity value can apply two ways: to the asset itself; and to the security associated with it, as when a company attracts more buying interest than its stock market capitalization can support—when there aren't enough shares to go around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A company that embodies both anticipatory localized inflation and scarcity value could be extraordinarily remunerative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A third thought is that <em>even a small-cap company </em>can control or be economically linked to an asset that is critical to—meaning a limiting factor for—a large industry. It is possible for such a small company to be the largest such in its economic sector or geographical area. In the right circumstance, it can achieve terms of trade advantage with an industry's dominant companies. Historically, superior ROE and financial performance are a function of having pricing power.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Illustration of a mouse wearing a crown and holding a trumpet, with the text 'THE MOUSE THAT ROARED'.\" width=\"151\" height=\"175\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might seem like a does-not-compute proposition in a world with an almost monomaniacal focus on the largest, most-owned companies that owe some of their preeminence to sheer scale and the market power that comes with it. But consider one illustrative out-of-the way example, and then one or two more obvious ones that, like gold, are likely to be top-of-mind in the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The out-of-the-way example is potash. Potash, you say? This is what provides potassium, one of the three essential crop nutrients, the other two being nitrogen and phosphorus. Global food production at the current scale would collapse without their near-constant application.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rising future demand curve for crop fertilizers is based on some inexorable factors that are noticeably similar to prior discussions about why demand for oil and gas is not going to fade away any time soon:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The global population continues to rise, which proportionately requires additional fertilizers.</li> <li>Food demand rises faster than population, because rising standards of living in poorer nations come with greater caloric intake.</li> <li>Further, a higher share of that new caloric intake is from animal products and other calorie-rich foods like vegetable oils, which require incrementally more crop production than grains and legumes.</li> <li>Importantly, the amount of arable land does not increase, which means that, on a per-capita basis, cropland is in constant decline: from 4,000 square meters in the 1960s to about 2,500 sqm in 2000. 2,500 sqm is about half the size of an American football field, including the end zones. Per-capita cropland was last projected by a U.N. study to fall to 1,900 sqm by 2030.</li> <li>All of this means higher required crop yields, which will require disproportionately more fertilizer, net of other yield enhancement technologies and process improvements.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This sequential expansion function between population growth, wealth effect and fertilizer demand is shown in the accompanying chart from BHP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHP\" title=\"BHP Group Limited\">BHP</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHP\" title=\"BHP Group Limited\">BHP</a>) (which mines not only metals and coal, but potash, too).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to demand, 90% of global potash consumption is for agriculture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to supply, there was a decade-plus expansion to answer a demand cycle that caused prices to quintuple, peaking at $682/ton in 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That expansion phase ended around 2015, when potash traded in the $300 range, but created an oversupply position that then caused prices to gradually decline through 2020, to $202.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supply disruptions caused by the Russia sanctions temporarily caused a price spike to $1,200 in 2022 (whoopsie, demand exceeded supply!), but it quickly returned to 2015's $360 range. <sup>15</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accordingly, prices are not high enough to induce investment in new supply and reserve replacement, so producers are availing themselves of still-extant surplus capacity. However, that excess capacity is expected to be fully utilized in the next several years...this all sound familiar?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Population up ~2.5 fold since 1960, crops ~3.5 fold, potash ~4.5 fold (Index, 1960 = 100)</strong></p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing Population, Crop production, and Potash fertiliser demand (Index, 1960 = 100) from 1960 to 2020. The Potash fertiliser demand curve shows a decade-plus expansion to answer a demand cycle that caused prices to quintuple, peaking at $737 per ton in 2009. The Crop production curve shows a collapse of the Eastern Bloc around 1990, followed by a recovery and subsequent decline. The Population curve shows a steady increase.\" width=\"590\" height=\"444\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p>Data: UN World Population Prospects 2019; International Fertilizer Association; BHP analysis based on multiple sources.

Almost 80% of U.S. potash imports comes from Canada. Canada is the world's largest supplier—at a 30%, share—and holds 45% to 60% of global reserves, depending on the calculation method.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within Canada, three companies produce all the potash, two of which produce more than a quarter of global supply. They are asset intensive mining companies, with a host of their own cyclical and capital risks and limitations, no different than for oil or gold extraction. And, wouldn't you know it, there is actually a potash royalty company, and it gets its royalties from those two largest North American potash producers. This is Altius Minerals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATUSF\" title=\"Altius Minerals Corporation\">OTCPK:ATUSF</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Altius doesn't call itself a potash royalty company, because potash is a bit less than one-third of its royalty revenues. On the other hand, its Base &amp; Battery Metals royalty revenues, which are about 40% of the total, are mostly from copper, which is also very difficult to get exposure to. Another nearly 10% came from iron ore. All of these commodities share the supply/demand dynamics that have been discussed thus far. Another nearly 20% of royalties are from solar and wind power projects, almost exclusively in Texas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To get exposure to these otherwise difficult-to-isolate strategic commodities that are each steadily approaching their localized scarcity expression moments—when the demand/supply balance tips—Altius has a market value of only $1.2 billion. The combined market cap of the two potash miners, Nutrien (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTR\" title=\"Nutrien Ltd.\">NTR</a>) and Mosaic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>), is almost $40 billion. The market cap of Freeport-McMoRan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>), the copper miner is nearly $60 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another frame of reference for the scarcity value of a $1.2 billion company like Altius Minerals: the lowest-weight stock in the S&amp;P 500 ((SP500), (SPX)), at less than 1/100 <sup>th </sup>of one percent, is News Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWSA\" title=\"News Corporation\">NWSA</a>). It has a stock market value of $15 billion. Which company has superior portfolio-relevant characteristics?

Horizon Kinetics' subsidiaries manage products that seek to provide exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The value of bitcoins is determined by the supply of and demand for bitcoins in the global market for the trading of bitcoins, which consists of transactions on electronic bitcoin exchanges (\"Bitcoin Exchanges\"). Pricing on Bitcoin Exchanges and other venues can be volatile and can adversely affect the value of the bitcoin. Currently, there is relatively small use of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to the relatively large use of bitcoins by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect a portfolio's direct or indirect investments in bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable, and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may be irrevocable. As a result, any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect the value of a portfolio's direct or indirect investment in bitcoin.
