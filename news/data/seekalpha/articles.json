(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCAP\" title=\"Crescent Capital BDC, Inc.\">CCAP</a></span>) has been among my few tactical BDC investment picks, which I have identified as compelling opportunities for capturing outsized returns.</p> <p>The whole idea behind venturing into these tactical positions is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to access above-average return potential that comes, of course, at higher risk, but not to such an extent that would render the trade overly speculative. Namely, the risks are higher than for high-quality BDCs, which I include in my core portfolio, but so are the returns higher as well. Here the added return potential should exceed the incremental risk exposure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to CCAP, then, as I outlined in my very first <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4673233-crescent-capital-q4-earning-and-price-divergence-make-this-a-buy-now\">bull thesis</a> that I published back in February, 2024, the BDC carries similar fundamentals to its closest peers, but at meaningfully lower P/NAV, which creates an opportunity to profit from multiple convergences closer to the peer average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What has happened is that initially my thesis was working out exactly as planned with CCAP outperforming the BDC market (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>), but once the sector started facing one headwind after another and the whole BDC land went out of favor, all of CCAP's gains evaporated and the P/NAV multiple once again dropped back into the relative discount zone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49926601-17722607092848_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"753\" data-height=\"494\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49926601-17722607092848_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49926601-17722607092848_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49926601-17722607092848_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49926601-17722607092848_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49926601-17722607092848_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, CCAP has paid attractive dividends without any unexpected cuts, and on the portfolio quality front, it managed to nicely avoid materially rising non-accruals that would clearly then justify the discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, just recently, CCAP published the Q4, 2025 <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/220/123220/original.pdf\">earnings deck</a>, which reveals several interesting aspects that are critical to understand for both bears and bulls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, I think that it makes sense to revisit the case and take a look at it from the lens of a current BDC investor, who is probably now at least a bit worried about SaaS-driven non-accruals and, in general, private credit-wide credit stress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's dive in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will start with the fact that as a result of the ongoing selloff in the BDC sector that is primarily driven by the fears of mounting credit risk across the SaaS universe, CCAP's P/NAV has continued to sink lower and lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the P/NAV stands at 0.66x, and the dividend yield has jumped to 13.4%, which is an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCAP/dividends/yield\">all-time high</a> for the BDC. The ~34% discount is what signals that the market has priced in really bad things happening for CCAP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I think that this is a nice segue to the Q4 earnings data points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just as almost all BDCs in the sector, CCAP has experienced a slight NII per share decline compared to the result achieved in the prior quarter. For CCAP the NII per share decreased from $0.46 in Q3 to $0.45 per share now, mostly as a result of lower SOFR and tighter spreads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, here I have to underscore that the current NII per share means that CCAP's base dividend is 107% covered, which still leaves some buffer in the system to absorb headwinds from future rate cuts or the lagged effects of the Q4 base rate cuts that have not yet fully percolated through the books.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sector average base dividend coverage is 99%, which means that the dividend angle should theoretically provide some bonus points to CCAP's multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from the earnings side, the portfolio quality remained relatively solid or generally in line with what other peers have been reporting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The non-accrual level did indeed tick up, but the rate of change was not that material. The non-accrual level increased by 40 basis points, reaching 2% of the total portfolio fair value. It was driven by two smaller underperforming investments. Here it is, however, worth noting that already in early Q1, 2026, CCAP managed to monetize one non-accrual and restructure another one, which has decreased the non-accrual rate to 1.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the two newly added non-accrual positions and some proactive markdowns on select smaller positions, CCAP had to register a quarterly NAV decline of just below 1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the portfolio quality remained robust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the weighted average loan-to-value of the portfolio stood at ~40%, which is certainly on the conservative side compared to what we can see for other BDCs. Similarly, the weighted average interest coverage of the companies was 2.2x, which again is better than the typical industry standard that revolves around 1.9x to 2.1x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, so far I hope that you will agree with me that there has not been a single point that would justify CCAP's depressed valuation. Granted, the emergence of two new non-accruals is nothing positive, and many BDCs have indeed managed to avoid such in Q4, but again, we are not talking here about significant positions that would make a case for a ~34% discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are, however, three nuances that could theoretically support a more depressed pricing for CCAP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, software and services account for ~20% of the portfolio, which might not send the right message to investors, who are walking away from their BDC positions because of the SaaS risks. However, two things: 1) this exposure is largely consistent with many (even top-tier) BDCs, and 2) CCAP applies cash flow-based underwriting principles and does not invest in any annual recurring revenue or ARR loans here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, CCAP does not have much gas left in the tank to accommodate portfolio growth. As of Q4, 2025, the debt-to-equity stood at 1.25x, which is the usual ceiling level in the sector, where going over that would imply elevated risk-taking. However, the sector average is not far away from the 1.25x level either - i.e., the average is 1.20x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, it seems that CCAP has arrived at a situation that I have been signaling to BDC dividend investors for quite some time. Namely, the prospects for a stable base dividend payout are questionable, or, to put it differently, the base dividend is likely to get cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Henry Chung, president of CCAP, in the recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875735-crescent-capital-bdc-inc-ccap-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, has, I think, clearly sent a message about a potential cut:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We're operating from a position of strength today by over-earning the dividend. And what we really want to do here is proactively adapt to what we are potentially expecting to be a lower rate environment, which obviously has implications for us as a predominantly floating rate asset base. And as a result, in terms of kind of the key focus areas, those are the 2 that I would point you to as we just think about this broader review.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, I would certainly not sell or avoid CCAP because of this aspect for the following reasons:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The potential cut is driven by lower SOFR, which is nothing CCAP specific or caused by a struggling portfolio (hence, I would not expect further repricing to the downside after such a cut).</li> <li>As CCAP has some surplus over the base dividend, it can avoid taking a significant cut. It depends on the case, but typically when BDCs cut their dividends, the cut itself is between 10% and 30% of the current base dividend. In CCAP's situation I would expect a cut that comes closer to the lower bound.</li> <li>Even if CCAP cuts by, say, 20%, because of the heavy P/NAV discount, we would still be left with a hefty ~10.7% dividend yield and a cash flow profile, which would be growth accommodative and supportive of stable NAV.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After digesting the Q4, 2025 data points, I have to conclude that CCAP is more discounted than it should be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The exhausted debt profile, small but consistent NAV contraction, and high exposure to SaaS should warrant some discount, no questions about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, such factors as surplus dividend coverage and a high-quality loan investment portfolio (from a leverage and interest coverage perspective) could make a case for a relative premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I put these things together, I still see a clear, high-return, medium risk situation that could be included in a tactical investment portfolio bucket (a smaller position, where the risk level exceeds that of what could be acceptable for core - buy and forget - dividend holdings).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I see that the \"high return\" component, which is mostly based on a P/NAV recovery (but also a juicy double-digit dividend), could play out only once the sector itself starts to slowly but surely bounce back from the current SaaS-driven mispricing, which, based on the historical selloffs (e.g., tariff tantrum, First Brands), is very likely less than 12 months.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if we see another similar element to SaaS or Blue Owl Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>) OBDC II liquidity issue emerging, we will have to wait longer until the overall level of fear comes down (meanwhile collecting \"just\" the double digit dividend).</p>",

This should not be surprising if we consider various factors affecting the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Today, DEO<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> remains fundamentally resilient despite the impact of softer market conditions. However, its upside potential remains limited as valuation justifies the continued price downtrend. Technicals adhere to it as momentum remains weak despite rebound attempts and new buying opportunities.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">DEO H1 2026: Headwinds Are Intense, But It’s Still Sober To Survive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global beer/wine/spirit market still grapples with recovery amid stubborn inflation and new tariffs. The increasing cost pressures continue to affect their pricing strategies. The changing attitude of the younger generation towards alcoholic beverages continues to hamper recovery and growth in many players. Even a big business with established brands like Diageo plc is having a hard time dealing with the current market environment. Yet, its strategic management allows it to weather these headwinds. This was visible in its most recent performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In H1 2026, its net sales amounted to <a href=\"https://www.diageo.com/pdf-viewer.aspx?gid=307336661&amp;src=%2F%7E%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FD%2FDiageo-V2%2FDiageo-Corp%2Fpress-release%2F2026%2Ff26-interims-results-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$10.46B</a>, down by 4.0% YoY from $10.90B. Lower consumption and production was the primary cause, as volume dropped across five regions in the world. This was most evident in North America and Europe. In fact, volume decreased to 121.7M ethanol units, or EUM versus <a href=\"https://www.diageo.com/pdf-viewer.aspx?gid=307336661&amp;src=%2F%7E%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FD%2FDiageo-V2%2FDiageo-Corp%2Fpress-release%2F2025%2Ff25-interims-results-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">122.8</a>. Even if we divide net sales by volume, we will arrive at the same observation. The average sales per EuM were only $85.95 versus $88.76. With that, both demand and pricing power decreased. Higher excise duties also drove it, which should not be surprising amid higher tariffs in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772198767138926_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"933\" data-height=\"621\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772198767138926_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Regional Report\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772198767138926_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772198767138926_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772198767138926_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772198767138926_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Regional Results <span>(DEO H1 2026 Report</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a lighter note, DEO still strengthened in Africa with its positive organic growth in volume and net sales. In fact, the average sales per Eum increased from $48.72 to $50.46. In addition, it has improved its efficiency with its lower COGS and operating expenses. This shows that DEO has already started coping with the current market dynamics. Its production volume decreased in line with the lower demand. As a result, its operating margin reached 29.8% versus 28.9%. The double-digit margin also shows that sales were still large enough to cover the operating costs and expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721988983183143_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"941\" data-height=\"792\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721988983183143_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"539\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721988983183143_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721988983183143_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721988983183143_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721988983183143_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income Statement <span>(DEO H1 2026 Report</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Challenges</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like many peers, DEO remains vulnerable to inflationary headwinds. For instance, inflation in the US remains stubborn at 2.7%. This is still close to the 16-month high of 3.0% and higher than the Fed’s target of only 2.0%. In addition, positive inflation means positive price increases. As such, purchasing power and discretionary spending on alcoholic beverages may remain soft. It must also consider higher tariffs since they raise domestic prices as well as excise duties. The combined impact of the two increases its cost pressures. With that, it’s not a surprise that it reduced its production volume YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another consideration is the changing perception of many consumers. In the US, the percentage of adults who reported drinking alcohol has already decreased from 62% to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/693362/drinking-rate-new-low-alcohol-concerns-surge.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">54%</a>. And among those who still drink alcohol, the frequency decreased from 3.8 nights per week in 2024 to 2.8 nights. This may be driven by the negative view of alcohol. The percentage of those who think that alcohol is bad for health has risen dramatically in the past 20 years across all age groups. This was most visible among the younger ones. So, demand may remain affected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721993473182378_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"762\" data-height=\"334\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721993473182378_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Americans Who Drink Alcohol\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721993473182378_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721993473182378_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721993473182378_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721993473182378_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Americans Who Drink Alcohol <span>(Gallup</span>)</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994199132931_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"761\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994199132931_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alcohol Perception\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"633\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994199132931_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994199132931_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994199132931_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994199132931_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Alcohol Perception <span>(Gallup</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Mitigants</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the things that may help DEO cushion the impact of softer market conditions is its robust fundamentals. Its liquidity is still ample and promises sustainability and dividend longevity. Because its operations are still profitable, it also generates enough operating cash inflow to cover capex and dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721990419939291.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"598\" height=\"743\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721990419939291.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721990419939291.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721990419939291.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow <span>(DEO H1 2026 Report</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DEO complements it with prudent debt management through timely issuance and repayments. As a result, its cash and cash equivalents remain high at $2.2B. Meanwhile, its borrowings have a decent maturity profile since over 80% of the total has a maturity of more than one year. This is still in line with the net debt/EBITDA of 3.4x, which means that DEO needs 3.4 years to repay the whole amount at once even if it doesn’t have to. Hence, it still has enough capital buffer to sustain its operating capacity and dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721991551272871.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"596\" height=\"713\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721991551272871.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721991551272871.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721991551272871.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet <span>(DEO H1 2026 Release</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at outside factors, DEO may benefit from the policy easing cycle since it can bolster economic activity, employment, and wages. This can also make loans and credit cards more accessible and affordable to support consumption. Lastly, it can lower the repricing rate of its variable-rate borrowings, which can improve its liquidity and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reassess its valuation, I updated the Dividend Discount Model or DDM. The annualized dividend is still $4.14 based on the half-year payouts. The dividend growth rate is 0.90% (($4.14/$3.96)^(1/5)-1) based on the 2021-2025 CAGR. Meanwhile, I retained its risk premium at 6.0% to be conservative and consistent with my previous coverage. Lastly, my new estimated beta is 0.22, which means that DEO has become less volatile. This is not surprising since the downtrend pattern of the stock price was almost uninterrupted. There were no sharp rebound attempts. Using all this information, I estimated a TP or target price, of $87.71. If I add a 5% risk consideration, it will be $83.33. This justifies the continued price decrease. It also shows that the price is already reasonably cheap. However, upside potential still appears limited, as the gap between the current and target price remains narrow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994844143918_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"831\" data-height=\"212\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994844143918_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Discount Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"163\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994844143918_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994844143918_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994844143918_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994844143918_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend Discount Model <span>(Author's Computation</span>)</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994864009109_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"797\" data-height=\"201\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994864009109_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Discount Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"161\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994864009109_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994864009109_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994864009109_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721994864009109_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend Discount Model <span>(Author's Computation</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technicals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DEO’s technicals have shown a slight improvement as rebound attempts continued with higher highs and lows recently. The price also surpassed the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, showing that recent momentum has become stronger than the average in the past 50 and 200 days. In addition, the 50-day SMA is shifting its direction, which suggests that market sentiments are more optimistic today. However, the price showed a strong reaction to the H1 2026 report of the company. We saw the strong selloff in the past two days. And now, the stock price is back below the two SMAs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199788800728_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1869\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199788800728_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199788800728_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199788800728_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199788800728_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199788800728_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(Yahoo Finance</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other indicators also warrant caution and show that there’s more to the recent selloff than a mere post-earnings reaction. The MACD line is now trending below the signal line as buying volume decreased. Meanwhile, the histogram is now within negative territory, which implies that selling volume has already outpaced buying volume. Its RSI is still decreasing sharply following the stock overbuying that prompted profit-taking last month. There was also an early bearish divergence signal if you look at the price highs versus MACD and RSI from February 11 to 24. Fewer traders wanted to enter as the stock price increased further and became overbought.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721998114113932_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1917\" data-height=\"872\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721998114113932_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721998114113932_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721998114113932_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721998114113932_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-17721998114113932_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(Yahoo Finance</span>)</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199918585312_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1855\" data-height=\"846\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199918585312_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199918585312_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199918585312_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199918585312_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61361597-1772199918585312_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(TradingView</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diageo plc stays resilient despite the impact of softer market conditions. Its operational efficiencies and robust liquidity ensure its sustainability and dividend longevity. Yet, its valuation is still quite unattractive due to limited upside potential even after the selloff. Technicals are still weak today despite recent rebound attempts. I’m reiterating my hold rating on this stock.</p>",

That allocation to lower-yielding BSL, when combined with lower SOFR base rates and upper-middle-market spread tightening, has driven distribution yields down for the BDCs and / or those BDCs have increased leverage to maintain distribution yield (investors are taking on more risk for the same or even lower return). While the lower middle market is certainly not immune to origination pressures from geopolitical shock events, interest rate changes, or other macro events, it has proved more resilient over time. Principal Alternative Credit (PAC) offers clients the benefits we realize by operating in the lower middle market, along with a number of other firm-specific advantages, that when combined result in robust client capital deployment across our client portfolios - no client has ever been less than 70% invested at initial capital deployment and almost all are 100% deployed today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The lower middle market origination advantage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While M&amp;A markets and the resulting demand for direct lending are always subject to economic conditions and interest rate volatility, the lower middle market has exhibited relative resilience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to Capital IQ, U.S. M&amp;A deals valued at less than $200 million have exhibited much more stability than the rest of the M&amp;A market. The standard deviation for the change in the number of deals completed year-over-year is 17% for deals sub-$200 million and 29% for deals above $200 million since 2000. You can also see in the chart below that the lower middle market remains relatively stable in times of distress, such as in 2001, when large deal volumes were down 42%, but smaller deal volumes were only down 15%. Even in the Great Recession, large deal volumes declined 38% in 2008 and 32% in 2009 for large deals versus 8% and 11%, respectively, for smaller deals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/58280443-17723686019173746_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1392\" data-height=\"744\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/58280443-17723686019173746_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US M&amp;A deals over time\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/58280443-17723686019173746_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/58280443-17723686019173746_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/58280443-17723686019173746_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/58280443-17723686019173746_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <th>Standard deviation for deals &lt; 200mm</th> <td>0.17</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Standard deviation for deals &gt; 200mm</th> <td>0.29</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These smaller deals are typically owner-operators selling to private equity for the first time. Owner-operators have idiosyncratic drivers to sell that are more immune to macroeconomic forces. The business owners of the baby boomer generation often face the challenge of their children not wanting to take over the family business and thus need to find new ownership for their business. Often, these owners sell to private equity, while rolling a significant portion of their equity into the new deal. The initial transaction serves to diversify their wealth and provides the ability to share the risk of growth with a private equity firm who brings additional resources and experience to the process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some smaller company M&amp;A activity is driven by strategic buyers looking to acquire smaller businesses despite the economic environment, as the smaller deal size remains digestible even during times of stress. This is a core component of Principal’s underwriting strategy - identifying those businesses that have value to strategic buyers beyond financial engineering. Since inception, half of Principal’s M&amp;A-related exits have been to strategic buyers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The advantages of non-sponsored deal flow</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe non-sponsored deals, when underwritten well, can offer a strong source of alpha for client portfolios (see <a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/fixed-income/benefits-robust-non-sponsored-deal-sourcing-middle-market-direct-lending\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Benefits of robust non-sponsored deal sourcing in middle market direct lending</a>). However, non-sponsored origination is also a stabilizing force on origination volume. Non-sponsored deal flow is often not reliant on large-scale M&amp;A, but instead on changes in ownership (e.g., management teams buying out minority shareholders), refinancing pieced together capital structures to simplify them (often they feature a mix of equipment lines, bank loans, etc.), and smaller, tuck-in M&amp;A activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an example, during the Q2 2025 Liberation Day-related M&amp;A slowdown, nearly one-third of Principal Alternative Credit’s closed deals were non-sponsored. While our close rate has always remained conservatively lower on the non-sponsored side of our business at ~2% versus ~4% for sponsored transactions, the non-sponsored book can provide stability in times when sponsored activity slows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Principal Alternative Credit - strategic advantages</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Principal warehouse facility enables Principal Alternative Credit to deploy clients’ capital more efficiently while increasing transparency to clients. Principal closes a portion of each loan into its warehouse facility. Loans in the warehouse facility are available for sale into investor vehicles and allow for the matching of fund inflows with loans available for sale to maximize deployment. This facility reduces the j-curve for our clients considerably, for example, Principal Alternative Credit has never had a client less than 70% deployed at initial funding. It also increases transparency/reduces blind pool risk, and allows for efficient season-and-sell (no skimming the loan price/full economics passed along to clients).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Principal continues to invest in origination capabilities, adding significant origination capacity through new hires over the past twelve months, ensuring our business is fully scaled ahead of growing demand from clients. Clients are able to benefit from our expanding origination capabilities and the natural ramp of originators relative to more static direct lending platforms.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Building a strong origination platform is critical to the success of any direct lending organization. By having the widest funnel possible, origination and underwriting can help us to identify and select the most compelling opportunities for our investors. Further, by operating in the lower middle market and pursuing non-sponsored transactions, investing in Principal Alternative Credit’s vehicles may offer a more stable source of capital deployment. Our origination approach, when combined with our unique warehouse facility, has enabled clients to largely avoid the j-curve in Principal Alternative Credit funds despite several years of M&amp;A volume below peak 2021 levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/fixed-income/value-drivers-lower-middle-market-origination\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

The background for sector underperformance over the past year is well known. Loan credit spreads (the assets on CLO Equity balance sheet) tightened faster than CLO Debt spreads (the liabilities in CLO Equity balance sheets) which drove a drop in income for the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717595508392138.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income CEF Tool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"532\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717595508392138.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717595508392138.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717595508392138.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income CEF Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of the demand for loans has been driven by captive funds where managers retain the CLO Equity portion for their own capital. Because these funds have a more favorable fee structure, they have become more popular and have driven strong demand for loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, a handful of credit issues, such as First Brands, drove losses in the sector. And more recently, loan prices have fallen, particularly in the software sector, which makes up around 10-15% of CLO portfolios. This further weighed on CLO Equity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there is a plus, it’s that the drop in loan prices increased the equity arbitrage or income going to CLO Equity. This figure has already increased by 10% vs. the previous month and is likely to move higher. A number of managers, including Carlyle and BlackRock, are buying loans for new CLOs to take advantage of the lift in equity arbitrage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CLO Equity Fund <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECC\" title=\"Eagle Point Credit Company Inc\">ECC</a> held its earnings call this week. It’s a good source for what’s happening in the market - far better than OXLC which offers little insight and typically sounds like it doesn't really want to be there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s interesting is that ECC, which has traditionally been a fairly pure CLO Equity fund, has begun to pivot away from the sector somewhat. More than a third of the portfolio is now allocated to securities other than CLO Equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717600048995752.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ECC\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"369\" height=\"178\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717600048995752.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/30644215-17717600048995752.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ECC</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are largely in ABS and regulatory capital relief transactions where banks offload the risk on their loan portfolios to private investors to lessen the capital held against loans on their books as well as ABS securities. This sharply contrasts with a fund like OXLC where 99% of the portfolio is in CLO Equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ECC recently improved its cost of capital by replacing an 8% Series F preferred with 7% coupon convertible preferreds. The distribution was also cut sharply to $0.06, resulting in a 13% NAV yield. The quarterly $0.18 distribution is below the $0.23 of income for the quarter, which should support the NAV though it might not be enough to stabilize it if current trends continue. Another CLO Equity Fund <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPMC\" title=\"Sound Point Meridian Capital Inc\">SPMC</a> also cut its distribution, lowering its NAV yield to 17%.

The company has continued to invest significant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WRBY/cash-flow-statement\">CapEx</a> in new stores to drive earnings growth, <a href=\"https://s28.q4cdn.com/987131352/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Warby-Parker-Inc-EarningsDeck-Q4_2025_V2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">opening</a> 47 net new stores during 2025. The total number of stores now stands at 323, still leaving significant space to grow to the 900 long-term store target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The report did still reflect quite a slow performance underneath; the report missed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WRBY/earnings\">Wall Street's consensus estimates</a> for both revenues and the EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues came in at $212 million with 11.2% year-on-year growth, slowing down slightly from 13.0% growth in full-year 2025. The slowdown seems quite disappointing on the surface—Warby Parker ended 2025 with 17% more stores than 2024, implying that revenue growth has stalled in existing stores. Similar, slightly underwhelming, 10-12% revenue growth is guided to continue in 2026, and Q1 is guided to show an especially sharp slowdown to <em>only 6.5-7.5% growth</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697304611473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"931\" data-height=\"492\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697304611473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"warby parker operational metrics q4 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697304611473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697304611473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697304611473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697304611473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>WRBY Q4'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There has been macroeconomic weakness that, in my opinion, explains at least a good part of the slowdown. CEO David Gilboa noted some transient softness in demand in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876013-warby-parker-inc-wrby-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call</a>; weak <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence\" rel=\"nofollow\">consumer sentiment</a> seems to have weighed on demand for glasses, causing a -6% unit decline in industry-wide prescription glass sales during 2025. The BEA’s <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=survey&amp;_gl=1*424ste*_ga*MTIwMTI5MTA2MC4xNzcyMjEwMTUx*_ga_J4698JNNFT*czE3NzIyMTAxNTEkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzIyMTAyMzkkajYwJGwwJGgw#eyJhcHBpZCI6MTksInN0ZXBzIjpbMSwyLDNdLCJkYXRhIjpbWyJjYXRlZ29yaWVzIiwiU3VydmV5Il0sWyJOSVBBX1RhYmxlX0xpc3QiLCIxIl1dfQ==\" rel=\"noopener\">Q4 GDP update</a> shows a slowdown to a -0.9% decline in real consumption of durable goods in the U.S., implying that macroeconomic pressure has indeed pressured demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the consumer sentiment has stayed low going into 2026, similar pressure weighs on the upcoming revenue outlook as well. Ultimately, consumer weakness should be transitory. The especially sharp Q1 weakness is related to winter storms and cold weather, another transitory headwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_64fe3a75f2d324ea1b0c832d976ca89a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_64fe3a75f2d324ea1b0c832d976ca89a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_64fe3a75f2d324ea1b0c832d976ca89a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_64fe3a75f2d324ea1b0c832d976ca89a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current environment weighed on Warby Parker’s Q4 profitability as well. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $15.2 million at a 7.2% margin, even declining by 10 basis points year-on-year. While Warby Parker’s increasing scale has continued to improve SG&amp;A efficiency, the gross margin was down by 170 basis points to 52.4%, reflecting tariffs, an increased doctor headcount, growth in lower-margin contact lens sales, and increased shipping costs. Warby Parker has chosen to implement price increases very selectively, limiting the company’s ability to mitigate margin pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Very positively, the margin headwind is assumed to be temporary. Warby Parker guides the 2026 adjusted EBITDA margin at 12.2% at the midpoint, up by 130 basis points from 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697673340878_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"777\" data-height=\"457\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697673340878_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"warby parker 2026 guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"376\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697673340878_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697673340878_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697673340878_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722697673340878_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>WRBY Q4'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe that while Warby Parker’s growth has slowed down for now, the growth story is still on track. A temporary industry downturn is weighing on the company, but store expansion is still driving a healthy earnings growth outlook ahead. Warby Parker plans to open 50 new stores in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Focus Is on Warby Parker's AI Glasses Launch with Google</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Warby Parker’s long-term retail growth story is largely on track, I believe that the focus is on the company’s AI glasses launch with Google. As <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4450618-warby-parker-shares-surge-after-google-commits-up-to-150m-to-develop-ai-glasses\">announced</a> back in May 2025, Warby Parker and Google are working together to develop AI-powered glasses. The product will compete against Meta Platforms Inc.’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and Ray-Ban’s collaboration glasses. The first product of the partnership is now launching in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s massive revenue potential in the partnership for Warby Parker. Ray-Ban and Meta sold <a href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/cap/content/283150/\" rel=\"nofollow\">over 7 million units</a> of AI glasses in 2025 with <a href=\"https://fintool.com/news/meta-ray-ban-glasses-20-million-production\" rel=\"nofollow\">plans to double production</a> during 2026. Assuming 7 million annual units and a $400 retail price, the glasses already generate $2.8 billion in annual revenues, more than three times Warby Parker’s total 2025 revenues. The market is still growing very rapidly; the launch presents immensely high revenue potential for Warby Parker.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, whether Warby Parker and Google can capture significant market share from Ray-Ban and Meta and others remains to be seen, but I believe that there’s clear potential to do so. Google has committed to spending up to $150 million on the launch, highlighting a significant commitment. Warby Parker doesn’t quite rival Ray-Ban’s brand scale, but <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google clearly outcompetes</a> Meta in AI model performance; Warby Parker has a very valuable partnership in the launch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Warby Parker’s 2026 guidance doesn’t include any revenues from the launch yet. For now, the potential from AI glasses is high, but also uncertain. It’s unsure how high margins Warby Parker will generate from the glasses.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s Now Good Reason for the Premium in WRBY’s Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I updated my discounted cash flow (DCF) model for Warby Parker. Even though macroeconomic pressure currently weighs on growth, I assume faster long-term revenue growth than previously due to the AI glasses launch. I estimate a 2025-2035 revenue CAGR of 12.0% with 3% perpetual growth after the estimate period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further SG&amp;A efficiencies from increased scale should continue to drive margin gains. I now estimate profitability using adjusted EBITDA, and expect the margin to mature at 16% by 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the cash flow conversion, I expect 10% of EBITDA to be paid as taxes over the long term, and that Warby Parker will have $70 million in combined annual CapEx, working capital increases, and miscellaneous cash expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I still assume 10% dilution to Warby Parker’s outstanding shares due to relatively high stock-based compensation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696473164418_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1036\" data-height=\"336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696473164418_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fair value estimate wrby stock\" width=\"640\" height=\"208\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696473164418_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696473164418_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696473164418_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696473164418_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DCF Model <span>(Author's Calculation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimates put Warby Parker’s fair value at $23.0, suggesting a moderate 8% downside as of writing. I believe that while Warby Parker is still very expensive at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WRBY/valuation/metrics\">25.1</a> forward EV/EBITDA, there’s now good reason for a premium in the valuation. The AI glasses launch has significant long-term earnings potential, even though such potential is currently challenging to price correctly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fair value estimate is up from $13.2 previously.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAPM</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DCF model uses a cost of capital [WACC] of 10.13%, derived from a capital asset pricing model:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696308132272.png?io=w640\" alt=\"cost of capital wrby\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"242\" height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/52204265-17722696308132272.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CAPM <span>(Author's Calculation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don’t assume Warby Parker to draw debt. For the cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y?s=us10y\">yield of 3.99%</a> as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.18% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s most recent <a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">January estimate</a> for the US. I have kept the beta estimate at 1.41. With a liquidity premium of 0.25%, the cost of equity and WACC both stand at 10.13%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Warby Parker’s growth story is currently slowed down by macroeconomic pressure, but overall, the retail expansion story remains on track with 50 new store openings targeted for 2026. Cost efficiencies from increasing scale are expected to continue to raise margins after a Q4 hiccup.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, the focus is shifting towards Warby Parker’s AI glasses launch alongside Google—the partnership clearly has massive potential for Warby Parker, albeit the potential is currently challenging to weigh. The launch justifies a premium in WRBY stock’s valuation; I upgrade my rating to Hold.</p>",

The value ranking looks at the price of a stock relative to a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> number of measurements that determine intrinsic firm value. Only the largest 10% of companies based on market cap are shown in this portfolio.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What it is:</strong> The Value Score is a composite score. It tells you how much you are getting in terms of profits, cash flows, assets, sales, etc. for the stock price that you pay. It is a relative measurement, so it says nothing about the overall level of the market. Rather, it answers the question: \"Given the current market level, which stocks give you the most current value for your dollar of investment?\" Tens are the most value, and 1s are the least.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>How to use it:</strong> Use it to find companies that are selling at a low price relative to their assets and profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Limitations of the Value Score:</strong> Watch out for companies with a lot of uncertainty or bad prospects for the future (e.g., Pharma companies with expiring patents, industries on the decline, etc).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>About the Ben Graham Formula</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Ben Graham Formula strategy contains ultra-stable stocks that will infrequently lose money if held over a long period of time. It was developed based on a screen in Graham's book, \"The Intelligent Investor.\" For those who have the book, it is the \"Defensive Investor\" screen. It selects stocks that are large in terms of sales and total assets, have a strong track record of earnings and dividend payments, have a reasonable current ratio and level of long term debt, and have a low valuation given by PE Ratios and Price to Book Value ratios.” <em>-YCharts</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While over half of this March collection of GASV is too pricey, or reveals somewhat skinny or no forward looking dividends, fourteen of the twenty-nine “safer” lowest-priced dogs of the GASV are buyable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">March finds Hafnia Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAFN\" title=\"Hafnia Limited\">HAFN</a>), IRSA Inversiones (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRS\" title=\"IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima\">IRS</a>), Weibo Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WB\" title=\"Weibo Corporation\">WB</a>), MPLX LP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX\" title=\"MPLX LP Common Units\">MPLX</a>), Pfizer Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>), Global Ship (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSL\" title=\"Global Ship Lease, Inc.\">GSL</a>), Enterprise Products (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD\" title=\"Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(Warren Buffett took<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> over writing duties from textile boss Ken Chace in </span><a href=\"https://dn790006.ca.archive.org/0/items/berkshirehathawayannualreports/berkshirehathaway1970_text.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">1971</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.) With his first letter, new CEO Greg Abel addresses the state of the company, its performance under the last year of Buffett's tenure, and his vision for how Berkshire will operate going forward. The 18-page document is an easy read that should be mandatory for anyone owning or considering owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Refreshingly, Greg Abel brought back the pieces of the shareholder letter that have been missing since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582256-berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-annual-letter-shareholders-2022\">2022</a>: specific discussion of each of the main business segments of the company and disclosure of key positions in Berkshire's equity portfolio. Gone are the historical anecdotes, generic \"invest in America\" advice (usually coupled with a reminder of how much Berkshire paid in taxes), and the sales pitch to come shopping at the annual meeting in Omaha. However, the letter did lead off with an important high-level topic for a new CEO: Berkshire's culture and foundational values. These are little changed, from the decentralized management structure to the capital allocation philosophy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, those looking for a big shift in Berkshire are going to be disappointed, while many long-term shareholders will be happy to maintain the status quo. There is no immediate catalyst for any \"Alpha\", and my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761043-berkshire-hathaway-good-results-but-even-warren-buffetts-not-buying-downgrade-to-hold\">ratings change to Hold one year ago</a> looks like a good call. The stock is little changed since then but clearly shows outperformance in a down market such as the April 2025 tariff tantrum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772320730768898_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1950\" data-height=\"675\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772320730768898_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Berkshire Hathaway one year chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772320730768898_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772320730768898_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772320730768898_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772320730768898_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, Abel has his own areas of emphasis, such as a greater focus on operations, which are different from Buffett. Abel has identified some problem areas where closing gaps can produce earnings growth even if there is no big up market or M&amp;A activity. Greg did us a great favor by discussing the specifics of 2025 in the shareholder letter, so I will be a bit less detailed about them here and focus more on the bigger picture.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Culture and Foundational Values</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Greg led off with some high-level core principles, most of which will sound familiar to Berkshire shareholders. The plan is to publish these values every year as an attachment to future letters while each year offering different examples of how Berkshire practiced these values. They are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Decentralized Model</li> <li>Integrity</li> <li>Financial Strength</li> <li>Capital Discipline</li> <li>Risk Management</li> <li>Operational Excellence</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I won't say much about the first five points. They have all been discussed by Warren over the years and sound like they will continue unchanged under Greg, who takes seriously Charlie Munger's 2021 statement that he will \"<a href=\"https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/2021/05/03/greg-will-keep-the-culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">keep the culture</a>\". Financial Strength and Capital Discipline mean that Berkshire is not going to try to support the share price by doing buybacks without a substantial discount to intrinsic value, and they will continue to not pay dividends as long as a dollar of retained earnings creates more than a dollar of market value. The fortress balance sheet remains more important than impatient growth, based on Greg's comment in the letter.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Our cash and U.S. Treasury holdings now exceed $370 billion. While some of this capital is required to support our insurance operations and protect Berkshire against extreme scenarios, it also constitutes our dry powder. There will undoubtedly be incremental opportunities to deploy our owners’ capital without compromising Berkshire’s resilience. My role is to ensure our liquidity levels and capital deployment remain intentional and deliberate. We will always aim for ownership of productive businesses over U.S. Treasuries.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To put 2025 in perspective, Berkshire's net stock sales of $13.8 billion were the lowest of the past 3 years (compared to $134.1 billion in 2024 and $24.2 billion in 2023). Berkshire spent around $1 billion on M&amp;A in 2025, including rodent control company Bell Laboratories, and around $800 million redeeming preferred shares in Berkshire Hathaway Energy. The company also spent $9.5 billion on OxyChem just after the year ended. So, the stock sales have mostly supported other investments, but free cash flow, which was $25 billion in 2025, continues to pile up as \"dry powder\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Strength and Capital Discipline feel like a lead weight when the general market is going up but are a life jacket in a bear market or even a correction, as we saw in the spring of 2025. While not a source of Alpha, they do provide lower Beta when the market is volatile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as I said, that is nothing new within Berkshire despite the CEO change. The real change with Greg is the emphasis on Operational Excellence. This focus looks appropriately long-term in nature. In several places in the letter, he compares metrics from last year to the 5-year average. While this may be an easy bar for a high-growth business, it is useful for mature businesses like those within Berkshire, where it may be unrealistic or short-sighted to target growth every year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Greg talked about decentralized decision-making and lack of bureaucracy, he also created a position overseeing consumer products, service, and retail, a collection of 32 smaller subsidiaries that together totaled about $6.7 billion of pre-tax income in 2025, on par with BNSF and more than BHE. This group will be led by Adam Johnson, also CEO of NetJets, who will be on stage for the second half of the Q&amp;A at the annual meeting. Greg is expecting Adam to stress \"accountability and a focus on avoiding complacency\" with the CEOs in his portfolio. I stated <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4837184-berkshire-hathaway-stock-deep-dive-into-q3-results-exercise-caution-reiterate-hold\">last quarter</a> that this focus was needed, so it is nice to see Greg seems to agree.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operational Excellence is important to the other parts of Berkshire as well, with the letter highlighting key focus areas. Within Insurance, the focus is on maintaining underwriting discipline as higher rates have drawn additional players into the market. Berkshire will not cut prices excessively to maintain premium volumes, which could slow revenue growth at this stage of the cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At BNSF, Berkshire remains focused on cutting operating costs while maintaining safety. The company is also committed to not chasing uneconomic M&amp;A just to match the Union Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNP\" title=\"Union Pacific Corporation\">UNP</a>)-Norfolk Southern (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSC\" title=\"Norfolk Southern Corporation\">NSC</a>) merger. Operating ratio improvements from 2024 to 2025 still have BNSF behind western peer Union Pacific but now similar to eastern railroads like Norfolk Southern (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSC\" title=\"Norfolk Southern Corporation\">NSC</a>) and CSX (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSX\" title=\"CSX Corporation\">CSX</a>), where costs have grown faster than revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772328509634772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"835\" data-height=\"320\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772328509634772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Railroad combined ratios\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772328509634772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772328509634772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772328509634772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-1772328509634772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author Spreadsheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At BHE, there is demand growth opportunity from hyperscalers and data centers for AI compute power. However, there is also increased risk of wildfires and tendencies for governments to try to get utilities to be \"insurer of last resort\" through lawsuits. BHE continues to defend itself against <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4554900-berkshires-pacificorp-to-pay-575m-settlement-of-u-s-governments-wildfire-claims\">claims</a> in the northwest US while exiting parts of the market like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552345-portland-general-electric-to-buy-pacificorp-washington-assets-for-19b\">Washington state</a>. In the shareholder letter, Greg refers to this as BHE \"rebalancing as the team positions it to move forward\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Greg cites Pilot as a turnaround story in progress. Pilot is spending capital to modernize its facilities and improve its scores in driver surveys, and operating cash flow is improving. However, the staged purchase of Pilot that delayed Berkshire management control until 2023, a move I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601281-berkshire-hathaway-old-fashioned-intelligence\">criticized at the time</a>, was described by Greg as a mistake that \"will not happen again\".</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equity Investments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While operations are a bigger focus than ever at Berkshire, the stock portfolio remains significant. So, it was gratifying to see a return of at least some stock positions disclosed in the shareholder letter. This was done in two tables. The first was a curated list of US-based holdings, noting,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long term economic prospects.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723299801418753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1743\" data-height=\"485\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723299801418753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Berkshire Key US Stock Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"178\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723299801418753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723299801418753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723299801418753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723299801418753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Berkshire Hathaway 2025 Shareholder Letter</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second table was the full list of 5 Japanese trading companies, also intended to be long-term holdings.

The only stock listed here seeing any recent selling was Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), which is being trimmed at a declining rate. According to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871863-tracking-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio-q4-2025-update\">13-F filings</a>, Berkshire trimmed just 4% of this position in Q4 2025. The other US holdings here have seen no buys or sells over a very long period. Berkshire has actually increased its stakes in the Japanese trading companies compared to the last time ownership was disclosed, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/?msockid=11ee0683f13867762fa31066f0756615\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For more insight, we should take the advice of Charlie Munger and \"<a href=\"https://blog.sigmatrader.net/2025/09/invert-always-invert-charlie-mungers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">invert</a>\" to learn from what is missing on these lists. Note that the US stocks shown here are ranked 1, 2, 3, and 8 by position size. The Japanese stocks are #7, 10, 11, 13, and 15 in the portfolio, per the CNBC tracker. Most notably missing are #4 and 5, Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>). Berkshire appears to be nearing the end of a multiyear campaign to scale out of bank stocks, with B of A the only one left and still declining at a rate of over $2 billion per quarter. The banks are not as cheap as they were post-financial crisis and have threats from disintermediation by Fintechs, overregulation from future US administrations, and uncertain monetary policy. Chevron is kind of a surprise omission from the list, as Berkshire bought over $1 billion worth in Q4 2025. It's possible Berkshire views it as a \"trading\" position, with buys and sells depending on valuation and oil prices, rather than a \"buy and hold forever\" stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2 equity-accounted investments, Occidental (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY\" title=\"Occidental Petroleum Corporation\">OXY</a>) and Kraft Heinz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC\" title=\"The Kraft Heinz Company\">KHC</a>), would rank #6 and 12 if they were on the stock portfolio list. Greg expressed disappointment with Kraft Heinz in the letter but gave no indication of selling. The 10-K indicated \"no intention of disposing of any Occidental common stock\" despite taking an impairment charge in Q4 as they did with KHC earlier in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the remaining two missing stocks out of the top 15 are Chubb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CB\" title=\"Chubb Limited\">CB</a>), #9, and Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), #14. I still see Chubb as a possible full takeover candidate, but only at much lower prices in a market crash, similar to Berkshire's full takeover of BNSF in 2010. As for Google, I can only say it would be nice to see Berkshire maintain this position, but I am not sure what their intentions are at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Greg provided some clarity on portfolio management responsibilities going forward, hopefully clearing up speculation among investors:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>At Berkshire, equity investments are fundamental to our capital allocation activities; responsibility ultimately resides with me as CEO. Ted Weschler manages about 6% of our investments, including a portion of the portfolio formerly overseen by Todd Combs.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Berkshire Stock Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This quarter's sum-of-the-parts valuation increased just 2.2% to $1.151 trillion from $1.127 trillion previously. Nearly all the value increase was in the cash and stock portfolios, as the insurance and operating business valuations stayed about the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result shows a fair value of $533.47 per B share, a 5.6% premium to where the stock closed on the Friday before earnings. Price/book is now 1.52, above the 1.48 last quarter but below my 1.6 ceiling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723326563825693_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1568\" data-height=\"1335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723326563825693_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Berkshire Hathaway Valuation Model\" width=\"640\" height=\"545\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"545\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723326563825693_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723326563825693_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723326563825693_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/21205541-17723326563825693_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author Spreadsheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Greg Abel brings an operations focus to Berkshire Hathaway that was missing under Warren Buffett but will maintain the culture of financial strength and capital discipline that has made it a relatively safe harbor for capital preservation in bear markets. This may disappoint investors looking for a quick bump from the enhanced buyback or dividend announcement that did not happen. Based on the valuation model, there is just a narrow margin of safety between market value and intrinsic value. The continued lack of buybacks suggests Greg sees the same thing.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This adds up to Berkshire remaining a \"stay rich\" rather than a \"get rich\" stock, as described by <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/berkshire-not-rich-stock-stay-143606216.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Whitney Tilson</a> in 2021. In other words, it is still a Hold, as it may be a drag in strong bull markets but serve as a life preserver when things get tough.</p>",

Ultimately, I conclude that the choice is Constellium SE (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSTM\" title=\"Constellium SE\">CSTM</a></span>) for three main<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> reasons: first, it strongly benefits from numerous secular tailwinds (so many nascent industries will depend on aluminum and aluminum alloys); second, the company is shifting toward a higher-margin mix of products; and third, the stock currently trades with an extremely attractive valuation. I argue that the market views this stock as a cyclical processor of aluminum, when in fact it is growing into a major supplier of high-margin parts for automotive and aerospace customers.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Methodology</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Creating the Shortlist</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to start by imagining what the best stock to buy right now would look like. First, we're in a time in which the impacts of AI are uncertain. There are two competing themes: that we're at the start of a transformational AI revolution or that we're nearing the peak of an AI bubble in which revenues at companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI are actually illusory. The best stock for 2026 has to be a winner in both outcomes. I don't want my pick to lean too heavily on getting the AI macro thesis correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, I want a company that has a large barrier to entry - in other words, a wide moat. A moat is difficult to quantify, but generally strong profitability metrics (high margins relative to the industry and sector) are indicative of a company with a sustainable competitive advantage. If the company is in a monopolistic or oligarchic market, then that would be ideal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, I want a company that has a simple, easy-to-understand business model. I want a pick where every reader can easily understand how the company makes money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want a company that is at least fairly valued. I use both Seeking Alpha's valuation grade and the PEG ratio (which is one of my preferred valuation metrics) to help narrow down the list, looking for stocks with the following characteristics:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Quant Rating = Strong Buy</li> <li>Valuation Grade = C or better</li> <li>PEG Ratio &lt; 1.2</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This screening produced 48 names, which I narrowed down to the following shortlist: MU, AMD, BNS, BCS, DELL, GM, CLS, and BRK.B, CSTM. I added some other \"Strong Buy\" stocks into consideration myself: AVGO, LITE, NESR, NEM, and IBRK.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trimming the Field</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of these names are too integrated into the danger of an AI CapEx Bubble for my liking: MU, AMD, AVGO, DELL, LITE, and CLS. So I discarded those first. I also don't want potential low-margin value traps and/or financial institutions, so that eliminates BCS, BNS, and GM from the list. NESR I eliminated from consideration because I believe it's too tied up with Middle Eastern geopolitical risk. Finally, I didn't want companies whose futures are tied directly to gold, as I believe it's become a bit of a speculative market (for example, kids in China buying up \"gold beads\"). So that eliminated NEM from consideration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That leaves three finalists: IBKR, BRK.B and CSTM. Let's go through each one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had originally intended to write this article on IBRK. I thought it was a perfect stock to pitch to the Seeking Alpha audience for obvious reasons. But when I got to valuing the company, I used a residual income approach, and I just couldn't justify the current valuation even with optimistic assumptions. Even though I think it's a great business (and my favorite online broker), valuation is non-negotiable, so I cannot recommend the stock as the best pick of 2026 if the valuation leaves little upside potential. It is a stock I will buy if I can get it at a cheaper price, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Berkshire Hathaway is a company I think is legitimately undervalued right now. Berkshire has about $358 billion cash on hand and a $290 billion public equity portfolio. So with a market cap of $1.09 trillion, the remaining part of the business, which is a cash-generating machine, is valued at $442 billion at the time of writing. That's about a 9.8x multiple on the segment's operating earnings. So in my view, BRK.B (or BRK.A) is a great buy for 2026, given that it's insulated from either AI disruption or an AI bubble and tends to do well in choppy markets and during corrections. However, if there is anything that doesn't scream \"hidden gem\" it's Berkshire Hathaway. Anyone can tell you to buy Berkshire, but it's not an idea that's worthy of a \"2026 top pick.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So by process of elimination, we land on the real top pick of 2026 in my view: Constellium SE. This stock immediately caught my eye. First, it has one of the highest Quant ratings on Seeking Alpha at 4.95 (ranked 31 out of 4281), and the metrics for this stock are flashing green across the board:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310902791905.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CSTM Quant Scorecard\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"377\" height=\"581\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310902791905.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310902791905.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation looks extremely attractive on almost all metrics:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"739\" data-height=\"978\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CSTM Valuation Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"847\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310904657197_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also has strong profitability metrics. Return on equity is 32.93%, compared to a sector median of 5.44%. It is, however, a relatively low-margin business (more on that later). The company is projected to grow EPS at nearly 70% CAGR over the next 3-5 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its face, this stock almost looks too good to be true, which has me asking, \"What's the catch?\" Although ratings and numbers can flag potentially good ideas, the devil is in the details of the company's fundamentals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Model: How Does CSTM Make Money?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quoting the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/171336525\">most recent 10K</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We are a global leader in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of high value-added specialty rolled and extruded aluminum products to the aerospace, space, defense, packaging, automotive, commercial transportation and general industrial end-markets. Our business model is to add value by converting aluminum into semi-fabricated and in some instances fully-fabricated alloyed aluminum products which meet stringent and performance-critical requirements from our customers. Our product portfolio generally commands higher margins as compared to less differentiated, more commoditized aluminum products. Our business model aims to pass through aluminum price exposure by pricing our products to include the cost of the metal purchased and hedging any remaining exposure to achieve aluminum price neutrality.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important thing to note is that this stock is not a speculative play on the price of aluminum. In fact, the company hedges its exposure to aluminum prices, which means that the success of the business is tied to the amount of refined aluminum products that are demanded rather than how aluminum is trading in spot markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has three operating segments: Aerospace &amp; Transportation (A&amp;T), Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products (P&amp;ARP), and Automotive Structures &amp; Industry (AS&amp;I). The A&amp;T segment provides technical products to companies in the aerospace, space, and industrial sectors (companies like Airbus, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and others). P&amp;ARP is the biggest segment by revenue, but it's also the lowest margin. It essentially provides rolled aluminum for products like beverage cans and auto body sheets. AS&amp;I provides technical products for automobiles like crash management systems and body structures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM is essentially a middleman between raw aluminum (both primary and recycled) and producers of goods that require aluminum. The following graphics from the company's 10-K show Constellium's position in the aluminum supply chain:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"718\" data-height=\"472\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Constellium Supply Chain Graphic\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/32850065-17723310905517757_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CSTM 10K</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is CSTM a Good Buy Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are a number of tailwinds I see for this company. I'll go through them one by one:</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Recyclability of Aluminum</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since aluminum is infinitely recyclable, the more that is mined and refined, the larger the recyclable pool is. Since recyclable aluminum is cheaper than primary aluminum, CSTM's input prices are likely to decrease over time as it uses more and more recycled aluminum as its primary input. CSTM actually recycles aluminum themselves. One location at Muscle Shoals called \"Element 13\" is <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constelliums-muscle-shoals-plant-receives-alabamas-large-manufacturer-of-the-year-award\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of the largest recycling facilities on the planet</a>, with the capacity to recycle 20 billion used cans per year. The company has the capacity to recycle 750,000 metric tons of aluminum per year. Recycling aluminum is a massive cost saver vs smelting primary aluminum from raw bauxite - it's about 95% less energy intensive, and the raw material cost is lower. Constellium has contracts with its customers to purchase recyclable scrap, so the company's sold products can become their own raw materials. Going back to the above graphic, with suppliers on the left and customers on the right, we could almost turn this into a loop. In some cases Constellium's customers are its suppliers - it buys aluminum scrap from its customers and recycles it into new raw materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM still depends on primary aluminum for 60% of its raw material supply. But the company has been expanding recycling operations, which has the potential to expand profit margins by lowering raw material costs.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Automotive Transition to EVs/Greater Fuel Efficiency</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High-quality aluminum products are key to the EV transition. Because EV batteries are so heavy, \"lightweighting\" the rest of the vehicle is key to attractive range. Aluminum tends to be the best product for that, given its high strength-to-weight ratio. Of course, makers of traditional automobiles also want to achieve the greatest efficiency they can, which necessitates greater reliance on aluminum as well. CSTM is one of the largest providers of aluminum products to major car manufacturers in North America and Europe. CSTM stands ready to benefit from the major push toward efficiency in both EV and ICE vehicles.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Constellium is a Key Supplier in the New Space Race</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blue Origin's <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-to-supply-airware-r-aluminium-solutions-to-blue-origin\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Glenn</a>, SpaceX's <a href=\"https://www.lightmetalage.com/news/industry-news/aerospace/how-light-metals-help-spacex-land-falcon-9-rockets-with-astonishing-accuracy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falcon 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-brings-nasas-artemis-mission-home-to-ravenswood-wv\" rel=\"noopener\">Space Launch System,</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-to-present-new-aerospace-innovations-at-paris-air-show#:~:text=No%20fewer%20than%20seven%20different,%C2%AE%20portfolio%20with%20new%20additions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orion Spacecraft</a> are all users of CSTM's aluminum alloy called \"Airware,\" which is a line of proprietary aluminum-lithium alloys. This kind of alloy is frequently used in rockets, especially reusable rockets like Falcon 9, because of its high strength-to-weight ratio. While Starship is unique in using fully stainless-steel alloys, nearly every other launch vehicle (like Blue Origin's New Glenn) uses aluminum-lithium alloys. If you believe that space is about to become commercialized, then CSTM could be an indirect way to invest in that future. The fact that CSTM, a European-headquartered company, actively won contracts with SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA away from American legacy aluminum-lithium suppliers is strong evidence of the quality of the company's product for spaceflight specifically.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Record Backlog in Commercial Aircraft</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Constellium is a major supplier to manufacturers of commercial aircraft, particularly Airbus. There is currently a <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-12-09-02/\" rel=\"nofollow\">massive backlog</a> of 17,000 aircraft (60% of the active fleet), which amounts to 12 years of production at current capacities. Airbus alone has a <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-01-airbus-reports-793-commercial-aircraft-deliveries-in-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">backlog of 8754 aircraft</a> as of the end of 2025. Since Constellium is one of the major suppliers to the commercial aerospace industry, this huge backlog guarantees many years of demand and significant growth potential for the company's A&amp;T products.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. New Market Opportunities</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I wouldn't bet against the company opening up new markets for its products. In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871586-constellium-se-cstm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">most recent earnings call</a>, CEO Ingrid Joerg said</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We also believe there are some opportunities in land-based defense and semiconductor markets given current market dynamics. In most industrial markets, we are focused on niche high value-added applications.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Niche, high value-added applications are where the stronger margins lie. Aluminum and aluminum alloys are in high demand in multiple disruptive industries, like EVs, data centers, green energy, drones, robotics, and more. So this company is poised to expand its product lines to high-growth industries where it can command higher profit margins, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major Risks</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Energy Prices</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM uses an enormous amount of energy for its operations, primarily natural gas and electricity. A rise in these input costs could diminish gross profit margins. The company purchases energy through forward fixed commitments and long-term contracts, which reduces price uncertainty somewhat. However, it would not be immune to an energy price shock. The risk from energy prices could be amplified by the fact that CSTM supplies automotive and aerospace companies. Higher energy prices could reduce demand for air travel and automobiles, which in turn could lead to CSTM's customers placing fewer orders. That risk, however, is tempered by the fact that higher fuel prices would increase demand for lightweight materials, which could be a tailwind to CSTM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I was writing this article, the US and Israel carried out an attack on Iran. If this attack causes an energy price shock, it could be a significant financial burden to the company. As I mentioned, the company is resilient to short-term energy shocks because it locks in so much of its future energy costs in futures and long-term contracts with suppliers. As I mentioned in the Opportunities section, CSTM also uses recycling to derive much of its raw aluminum, which further shields the company from energy price volatility since recycling is so much less energy intensive. Because recycling uses 95% less energy than primary smelting, CSTM has a clear advantage over its competitors in the event of a drawn-out energy price shock, even though it could hurt profitability eventually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, CSTM has shown the ability to pass higher input costs on to customers, which it could potentially do with energy prices as well.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Middleman Risk</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you're a middleman in a supply chain, you face risks from both ends. If CSTM's customers experience a drop in demand, the demand for aluminum products could decrease. However, I think that is unlikely. Aluminum used in consumer staples is likely to experience robust demand, since consumer staples is typically a non-cyclical industry. Aerospace is more cyclical, but the massive backlog for commercial aircraft suggests that demand is unlikely to evaporate any time soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other end, CSTM faces supply-side risk. A geopolitical crisis that shocks aluminum supply could pose a major risk, although the company has proven resilient to President Trump's high tariffs on aluminum. In fact, tariffs have actually benefitted the company tremendously since the aluminum it gets from domestic scrap is tariff-free, but the tariffs push up the price of refined aluminum. So tariffs allow the company to capture a larger spread between the cost of scrap and the selling price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If, however, there was a major supply shock with primary aluminum, that could drive up the price of aluminum scrap metal, which would hurt CSTM on the supply side. The company would burn through cash in a potential supply shock. The vast majority of the world's bauxite mining is done in Australia, China, Brazil, India, and Guinea, while very little mining is done domestically. There is not yet enough recyclable aluminum in circulation to meet demand, which means that continued extraction of bauxite (which gets refined into alumina, then smelted into aluminum) in those countries is vital.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. High Debt</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company does have a worrying amount of debt. Total debt is about $2.06 billion on a market cap of $3.36 billion at the time of writing. Net interest expense was $99 million, only about 8.2% of gross profit and 1.2% of revenues for 2025. The company <a href=\"https://www.constellium.com/news/constellium-prices-company-notes-offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">issued bonds in 2024</a> that mature in 2032: €300 million of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes bearing interest of 5.375% and $350 million of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2032 bearing interest of 6.375%. All the company's bonds are <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CSTM/bonds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trading at a premium to par value</a>, meaning the bond market is rating the bonds as lower risk than when they were issued. The company does face refinancing risk when the bonds mature. $325 million worth of notes mature in June 2028, while the rest mature in 2029 and 2032. I believe the company's strong cash flows recently provide an opportunity to decrease leverage, which would further expand margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's balance sheet has significantly strengthened in the past few years, which is another sign that it can manage its debt and that it's on a long trend toward improved solvency. The growth in book value of equity (representing total assets minus total liabilities) over the last few years is evidence of the improving balance sheet: total book value of equity has gone from -600 million in 2016 to -140 million in 2020 to 952 million in the most recent report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So are these risks big enough that they turn our hidden gem into a chunk of coal? I don't believe so. It would be impossible to find any stock with all opportunities and no risks - in other words, a hidden gem with no rough edges. I believe the opportunities I laid out above significantly outweigh the risks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM's stock has been on a roller coaster ride since its IPO in May 2013:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_d292a6f011dc0162a238f0518171a4de.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock recently broke out above a longer than 10-year trading range, between about $4 and $22 per share, which I view as a bullish move. In the last year the stock is up nearly 120%, which raises concerns that it could be overbought. But I think the strong valuation metrics counter that concern. One year ago, CSTM had a B+ valuation grade on Seeking Alpha's Quantitative Scorecard, while today it earns an A+ valuation score. If anything, that suggests that the stock price hasn't quite caught up with the improved fundamentals. The relative strength index at ~56 doesn't suggest that the stock is currently overbought either:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_710c0e9c38853c8fe5a5f27d7e3d382a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moat/Competitive Advantage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Each segment of Constellium's business has significant competitive advantages. One moat comes from its Airware alloys (for the A&amp;T segment). Creating these special alloys requires billions in capital expenditures and decades of R&amp;D. The market is solidly oligopolistic, with only a few major competitors: Howmet Aerospace and Arconic primarily. But this competition (albeit limited) is a positive. Demand is so great that no single company can fill it. The entire pie is growing so fast that any company with 20-30% market share (which Constellium has) is going to see tremendous growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The automotive segment has a large moat because Constellium co-engineers with automakers, making the switching costs high. If an automaker crash tests its vehicles using Constellium's products, then switching the design to use another company's products instead is extremely expensive. It would require an entire redesign and recertification of the vehicle. This is not just generic metal that Constellium is selling to automakers: it takes years of collaborative custom designing to develop these products for companies like BMW and Ford. That said, automakers are extremely cost-sensitive, so although Constellium has a moat in this segment, I believe the aerospace moat is stronger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another moat for the company is in the more boring P&amp;ARP segment. The moat here is volume and capital scale. Manufacturing rolled aluminum for beverage cans is actually much harder than it sounds. It requires flawless metallurgy to ensure that the thin alloys that make up beverage cans can withstand the pressure once they're filled. The monetary barriers to entry in this space are astronomically high. However, CSTM doesn't have the strongest pricing power in this segment, which is evidenced by the extremely low margins relative to the other segments. So although it would be difficult for newcomers to compete, buyers still have strong pricing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I rate CSTM's moat as wide, particularly due to the aerospace segment. The other segments contribute meaningfully, but the proprietary alloys used in aerospace are what give the company its strongest competitive advantage, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I use an EV/EBITDA model to value CSTM. My thesis is that the market is rating CSTM more as a commodity aluminum supplier and not based on the strong moat it has developed through the proprietary Airware aluminum-lithium alloys that are fueling the company's growth in high-margin segments. The forward EV/EBITDA ratio for the company is 6.48 compared to a 9.00 average in the Materials sector. I believe that CSTM should command a multiple higher than the Materials sector average, but to be conservative, I use a value of 9.0 forward EV/EBITDA to value the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553440-constellium-targets-780m-820m-adjusted-ebitda-in-2026-as-vision-2028-launches\">targeting $780-$820 million</a> adjusted EBITDA in 2026. I used the midpoint of that range ($800 million) and a 9.0 multiple to get a fair enterprise value of $7.2 billion. Subtracting net debt of 1.94 billion gets a fair equity value of $5.26 billion. Then dividing by the number of diluted shares of 142 million gives us a fair value per share of about $37, which is an upside of about 48% over the current share price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSTM is my top pick for 2026 because I see a number of tailwinds for the stock, but I want to emphasize that I'm not necessarily recommending it as a long-term \"buy and hold\" pick. This is an industry in which fortunes can change rapidly, and so the validity of my thesis needs to be continually reevaluated. At the moment, I believe the stars are in alignment for this particular company and that we may have identified a diamond in the rough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><i>Editor's Note:</i></span><i> This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha's </i><i><a target=\"_blank\" url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 2026 Long Idea investment competition</a></i><i>, which runs through February 28.

This article is intended to capture and share a large number of significant similarities and show you what we are doing to beat the markets again this year in our 9th year on Seeking Alpha.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I write this article, the US and Israel are launching air strikes against Iran over the weekend, and I have no idea what future events may unfold from this last day of February. I am reminded that back in February of 2022, the world was shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine that continues as a terrible conflict today, more than four years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The structure of this article will begin with a broad macro perspective that progresses to more sector details and shorter time frames. Within each section I will share some of the models, signals, and portfolios we are using to beat the markets again this year. Any one of these following sections could be an article by itself with much more detail than we discuss daily in our community. Instead, I will let the charts do most of the talking as succinctly as possible.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Macro Perspective</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the macro perspective, I begin with a look at the S&amp;P 500 from 2020 through this past week. Overlayed on the S&amp;P 500 chart are two Fibonacci retracement models comparing past and present similarities with future price supports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This technical price model suggests that market moves follow the Fibonacci sequence, and in downturns, look for supports at the levels indicated. In 2022, the S&amp;P 500 declines followed the retracement to -50% declines around the 3,500 support level, but not before testing the -23.6% level first at 4,200. If such a repeat were to occur in 2026, we would expect the first retracement to the 6,500 support levels as illustrated in the chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2262\" data-height=\"942\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 with fibonacci retracement\" width=\"1280\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_HCQHf_6WMAAoWEA.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>finviz.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have shared in prior market forecast articles about a strong market rotation, there are also other strong macro similarities forming back to 2022.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4856224-new-fed-chair-qe-and-lower-rates-where-the-2026-piotroski-graham-value-stocks-are-hiding\">New Fed Chair, QE &amp; Lower Rates: Where The 2026 Piotroski-Graham Value Stocks Are Hiding</a></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following S&amp;P 500 Growth vs. Value chart from 1994 not only shows the extreme divergence between the two investing approaches but also some similarities forming from 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w640\" alt=\"Growth vs Value on the S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w1536 1536w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/saupload_gateway_1.aspx?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>yardeni.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">So How Are We Trading This Macro Perspective?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our long-term portfolios are based on a variety of fundamental and forensic algorithms published in peer-reviewed research that have been well documented over many years to provide positive market alpha over 2-year periods.

These portfolios are also updated mid-year and at the end of the year.

Supporting the dividend rotation model is the fact that 7 of 10 selections are up over 12.7% YTD, with fully half the portfolio producing over 20% returns, not including large dividends. It will be interesting to see how the similarities to 2022 could fuel larger gains in value and dividend stocks this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/43516266-17723098714677513_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/43516266-17723098714677513_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Portfolio returns\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"582\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/43516266-17723098714677513_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/43516266-17723098714677513_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/43516266-17723098714677513_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/43516266-17723098714677513_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>stockrover.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, the Joseph Piotroski and Benjamin Graham model, leveraging two value algorithms from across many decades of time, has produced consistently strong returns in 9 years of live forward testing here on SA without a negative return.

It depends on semiconductors, energy, and critical materials. Explore the ETFs providing exposure to the AI buildout.</em></p> <h2>What Actually Powers AI?</h2> <p>It’s easy to think of AI as<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a purely digital phenomenon built on code and data floating in the cloud. But every model runs on physical hardware, consumes real electricity, and depends on materials that are pulled from the ground.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Training a frontier model like GPT-4 reportedly consumed around 50 gigawatt-hours of energy, which is enough to power San Francisco for three days.<sup>1</sup> And that’s just the training phase. Inference, which is the process of actually serving AI to hundreds of millions of users, demands even more sustained power over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of that computation flows through three critical layers:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Semiconductors</strong> that do the math.</li> <li> <strong>Energy</strong> that keeps the data centers running around the clock.</li> <li> <strong>Strategic metals</strong> embedded in the hardware itself.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When any of those layers hits a bottleneck like a chip shortage, a power constraint, or an export ban on critical minerals, it affects every corner of the AI economy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Can You Invest in the AI Supply Chain?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rather than chasing the handful of software names that dominate AI headlines, investors can target the physical infrastructure that every one of those companies depends on. VanEck offers three ETFs, each mapped to a distinct layer of the AI supply chain.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>ETF</td> <td>Role in AI Supply Chain</td> <td>Why It Matters for AI</td> <td>Why Invest</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/semiconductor-etf-smh\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF - Overview\"><strong>SMH</strong></a></td> <td>The advanced chips: GPUs, AI accelerators, that perform the trillions of calculations behind model training and inference.</td> <td>Hyperscalers are spending hundreds of billions on AI compute.

These are not recommendations to buy or to sell any security.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How the AI Supply Chain Works</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI runs on physical infrastructure. Before a model can answer a question or generate an image, semiconductors have to process the data, power plants have to keep the servers running, and raw materials have to be mined, refined, and built into hardware. Each layer depends on the one below it. Here’s how the three layers connect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/51b98c14423a4584bfa714e902338059/6872_ai-stack-blog_infographic_2026-02_v3_web.svg\" alt=\"How the AI Supply Chain Works\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: VanEck.

GPUs and custom accelerators handle the trillions of matrix multiplications required to train large language models, generate images, and run autonomous systems. <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608986-semiconductors-and-ai-are-taking-over\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"If You’re Reading This Semiconductors &amp; AI Are Taking Over\">The entire AI wave is, at its core, a semiconductor demand story</a></strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor industry also has a structural <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/videos/what-is-an-economic-moat/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"What Is an Economic Moat?\">moat</a></strong> and only a handful of companies worldwide can manufacture the most advanced chips. That concentration creates real pricing power and long-duration demand for the companies at the top of the food chain.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMH: Invest in the Semiconductors Driving AI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/semiconductor-etf-smh\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF - Overview\">VanEck Semiconductor ETF (</a><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMH\" title=\"VanEck Semiconductor ETF\">SMH</a><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/semiconductor-etf-smh\" title=\"SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF - Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">)</a></strong> tracks the MVIS<sup>®</sup> US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, covering the largest U.S.-listed chip companies across design, manufacturing, and equipment. It’s a single way to access the core of the AI buildout.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why AI Needs Reliable Energy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge is that most of the U.S. energy grid was built decades ago. Solar and wind help, but they’re intermittent - and a data center can’t afford to go dark when the wind stops blowing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why nuclear is getting serious attention. Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) have all announced plans to <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839104-ai-impact-surge-nuclear-investments-everything-need-know\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"AI's Impact on the Surge of Nuclear Investments: Everything You Need to Know\">secure nuclear power for their AI infrastructure</a></strong>. The federal government has moved to ease nuclear plant regulations and fund next-generation reactor designs. Nuclear delivers exactly what a data center needs: reliable, scalable, zero-carbon baseload power, 24 hours a day.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">NLR: Invest in the Industry Powering AI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/uranium-nuclear-energy-etf-nlr\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"NLR - VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF - Overview\">VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF (</a><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NLR\" title=\"VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF\">NLR</a><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/uranium-nuclear-energy-etf-nlr\" title=\"NLR - VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF - Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">)</a></strong> covers the full nuclear value chain - uranium mining, reactor construction and engineering, maintenance, and electricity generation. The fund tracks the MVIS<sup>®</sup> Global Uranium &amp; Nuclear Energy Index. For investors looking to position for the nuclear renaissance that AI is accelerating, NLR offers a direct way in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Materials Are Important to AI?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870373-copper-and-the-materials-behind-global-electrification\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"Copper and the Materials Behind Global Electrification\"><strong>Every AI chip, server rack, and cooling system is built from a cocktail of specialized metals.</strong></a> Here are a few raw materials that matter most:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Neodymium and dysprosium</strong> power the high-strength permanent magnets inside hard drives, server fans, and cooling pumps.</li> <li> <strong>Copper</strong> carries massive electrical currents through the busbars and wiring that connect clustered AI systems.</li> <li> <strong>Tantalum</strong> goes into the capacitors that regulate voltage in GPUs and memory modules during rapid workload shifts.</li> <li> <strong>Gallium and germanium</strong> are essential for advanced chip fabrication and the high-speed fiber optics inside data centers.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The geopolitical dimension here is hard to ignore. China produces the majority of the world’s rare earths and controls nearly all of the processing capacity. The Chinese government recently imposed export licensing rules that require foreign buyers to disclose end-use applications - effectively restricting access for U.S. defense and advanced technology purchasers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western governments are investing in domestic mining and processing alternatives, but reshoring these supply chains is a multi-year project. Demand from the AI buildout, meanwhile, keeps climbing.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">REMX: Invest in the Materials Building AI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/rare-earth-strategic-metals-etf-remx\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"REMX - VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF - Overview\">VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF (</a><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REMX\" title=\"VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF\">REMX</a><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/rare-earth-strategic-metals-etf-remx\" title=\"REMX - VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF - Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">)</a></strong> tracks the MVIS<sup>®</sup> Global Rare Earth/Strategic Metals Index, which requires constituent companies to derive at least 50% of revenue from the rare earth and strategic metals industry.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Invest in the AI Buildout with VanEck</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest AI winners over the next decade may not be the companies writing the models. They may be the companies making the chips those models run on, generating the electricity those chips consume, and mining the metals that make all the hardware possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VanEck’s AI supply chain ETFs let investors gain targeted exposure to the physical infrastructure that every AI company depends on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><sup>1</sup> Source: MIT Technology Review (May 2025), <strong><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"AI’s energy footprint\">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/ </a></strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>This is not an offer to buy or sell, or a recommendation to buy or sell any of the securities, financial instruments or digital assets mentioned herein.
