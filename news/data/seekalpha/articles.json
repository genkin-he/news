(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRI\" title=\"Carter's, Inc.\">CRI</a></span>) reported <a href=\"https://ir.carters.com/news-releases/news-release-details/carters-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 '25 results</a>, with positive top-line dynamics, growing via higher pricing and traffic, but negative bottom-line dynamics, posting worse gross (tariff) and operating (marketing) margins.</p> <p>The company also provided fairly<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> challenging guidance for FY26, expecting again to grow (mainly via pricing) but also to close stores, lose gross margins to tariffs, and potentially maintain operating income. Net income will suffer because of more expensive financing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we consider next year's guidance, the company is trading at a P/E of 10x forward. For a clearly challenged name, with no signs of cyclical improvement and very negative secular trends (drop in fertility), I continue to believe the name is not attractively priced and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833768-carters-top-line-resists-at-the-expense-of-margins-not-worth-15x-earnings\">maintain</a> a Hold rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 '25 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carter's results were not well received by the market, with the name falling as much as 20% intraday after the release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of the reason is probably the 2026 guidance (more on this later), but also the lack of results in Q4 '25. The dynamics in Q4 '25 are also repeating into 2026. We could summarize the situation as ok in the top line, bad in the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the top line, the reported figure was good because the company grew revenues by ~7.5% (U.S. retail almost 9.5%, wholesale 3.3%, and international 10%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, under the hood, revenues still show weakness. First, like with many retailers in Q4, Carter had an extra week compared to last year, which added $37 million in sales out of the $66 million increase (<a href=\"https://ir.carters.com/static-files/765784b7-911a-45b4-bd2a-5b1c777ba303\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings presentation</a> by segment). That means the comparable figure fell to $29 million, or ~3.3%. Then, we need to add that in both US retail and wholesale, the company is starting to add pricing because it needs to pass on the higher costs of tariffs. If costs go up by 5% and the company passes a 5% price increase, then even if sales are up 5%, no new units were sold, and gross profits are flat. Finally, in the International segment, the USD has depreciated against other currencies (mainly MXN and CAD), resulting in FX-driven growth in USD-denominated revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to the bottom line is where the real challenges in the top line continue to show. When adjusting for an impairment last year, the company's adjusted operating margin fell 370 bps. The majority of this fall is attributed to gross margins (460 bps YoY), a mix of tariff impact that has not been passed down to customers, and a policy of lower pricing aggressiveness because of the cyclical position of the market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Comments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance for 2026 is very similar to the results from 2025. That is, the company expects to grow the top line, but that is not going to translate into more profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carter's is expecting to grow LSD to MSD next year, with U.S. retail growing LSD (MSD after accounting for the closure of stores), whereas wholesale and international grow MSD. A big part of this is pricing, as commented on in the company's <a href=\"https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n3gtzup9/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company did not provide specific guidance for gross margins but expected SG&amp;A to be flat in dollar terms and operating income to grow LSD/MSD. This implies that gross margin should be approximately flat. However, this is hard to square with tariffs. The company commented during the call that the impact of tariffs will be between $200 million and $250 million in FY26 (gross, that is, before pricing action), but that it was only $60 million in FY25. A $225 million gross impact on revenues of about $2.8/2.9 billion implies a pre-pricing impact to gross margins of at least 7/8 percentage points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, Q1 works as an example, with sales expected to be up HSD, but operating income expected to be down more than 60%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To the operating line impact, we have to add the refinancing of fixed-rate bonds in late 2025, which will add $40 million in interest. This will result in EPS down 10/15% for the year (or guided to around $3.25).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the guidance above and that the stock was trading at around $32/34 on the day of the earnings release, it is basically trading at around 10x FY26 guided earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As commented in previous posts, Carter's looks very cheap when looking back (the company made close to $8 in EPS during the post-pandemic), but looking ahead, not so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only is the company showing pricing power challenges (otherwise it should be able to pass down tariff costs), but it also faces an outlook of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-birth-rate-all-time-low-cdc-data/\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower fertility</a> in the US and in North America that will have a clear impact on its market in less than 2 years from now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the company continues to represent a \"value trap,\" a name that is optically cheap but with a worsening business (at least for now) where a low multiple gets higher not because P grows, but because E decreases.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the time being, I still consider CRI as not opportunistic but will continue to follow the story with interest. I maintain a Hold.</p>",

Now, the first thing to know about ETJ is that it's certainly not a bull market fund, but unlike inverse ETFs, ETJ will go UP in a bull market, though it will not capture 100% of the upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that's why I say you have to look at ETJ as more of a high-yield bond fund without the risk of holding high-yield bonds in a bear market. What do I mean by that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you go back to 2008 during the last financial crisis, heavily leveraged fixed-income CEFs fell anywhere from <em>-30%</em> to <em>-40%</em>, just as much as equity CEFs. So don't think being in fixed-income bond funds during a bear stock market will save you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there was one fund back in 2008 that owned nothing but stocks and actually gained <em>+6.3%</em> vs. <em>-36.8%</em> for the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>), <em>$689.30 current market price</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that CEF was ETJ:</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So how did ETJ do it? Well, market prices in CEFs are established by shareholders buying and selling, so a CEF's market price can actually go much higher or much lower than its NAV. And in volatile markets, you can often see CEFs make dramatic moves at market price even if their NAVs aren't moving much at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that's what you can get in ETJ. I have no control over ETJ's market price, which is currently at a <em>-7.5%</em> discount to its NAV. But I do know that once the S&amp;P 500 falls <em>-3%</em> or more, ETJ's put options will start to kick in and provide NAV support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like most of the Eaton Vance option income CEFs, ETJ owns a technology-heavy S&amp;P 500 benchmark portfolio that has the typical top 10 holdings and sectors that look like this:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1058\" data-height=\"516\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"ETJ's top holdings and Sectors\" width=\"640\" height=\"312\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Eaton Vance</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But when you look at ETJ's option sleeves as of Dec. 31, 2025, it becomes very clear why Eaton Vance includes<span class=\"highlighted_text\"> \"<em>risk managed\" </em>in</span> ETJ's title.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's a snapshot of ETJ's put and call options as of 12/31/2025:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"772\" data-height=\"662\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"ETJ's option sleeves as of 12/31/25\" width=\"640\" height=\"549\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"549\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Eaton Vance</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What you see in the notional amounts above is what each option tranche actually protects in ETJ. The written call valuations are what the fund would keep if the tranche expired worthless, whereas the put options will go up in value as the S&amp;P 500 goes down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So if ETJ is a <em>$638 million</em> fund and if you add up the notional values of the written call options and long put options, they each add up to roughly <em>96%</em> of ETJ's total assets managed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's extremely defensive, especially when the put options go in the money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final key to understanding ETJ's option sleeves is that its written call options are put on every few business days at <em>+2.1%</em><span class=\"highlighted_text\"> out of the money, while its put options are slightly more out of the money at <em>+3.1%</em>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What that means is that ETJ takes in income from selling call options and turns around and buys put options, which are less expensive because they're more out of the money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And because ETJ puts on new option tranches every few days (unlike most option ETFs that use monthly expirations), the fund is always prepared for a sharp drop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It may take a <em>-3%</em> drop in the S&amp;P 500 for ETJ's latest tranche of puts to go in the money, but the more the S&amp;P 500 drops after that, the more of ETJ's put tranches will go in the money too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is why ETJ's NAV will not move much once its put options kick in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, ETJ's market price can be a lot more volatile than its NAV, but if you're looking for a fund that will eventually hold up in a bear market while paying an <em>+8.9%</em> market yield (annualized) while you wait, then ETJ should be in your portfolio and should be considered more of a safe income fund than an appreciation fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, ETJ is a bit different today than what it was back in 2008. Today, ETJ has more of a growth stock tilt in its portfolio (see top 10 holdings above) than what it had in 2008, which was more overweighted in value stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's because Eaton Vance did want to give ETJ better appreciation potential by including more Nasdaq 100 stocks, even though it uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark and for its options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, though, the Nasdaq 100 has <em>not</em> been outperforming the S&amp;P 500, so that's been a bit of a negative factor for ETJ. But ETJ is still a very forgiving fund at NAV (not necessarily at market price), and even if its portfolio is underperforming the S&amp;P 500, it should be able to deliver a reliable and sustainable high single-digit return, whether it's from its yield, from its appreciation, or a combination of the two.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that might look awfully good in case of a bear market!</p>",

Double-digit growth in revenue and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> cash collections were both positive, as was a year-over-year improvement in cash efficiency, but significant performance gaps remain, and management must find ways to improve key yield metrics to drive a sustained recovery in the share price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Friday morning, PRA Group shares are down about 7% since my last update, with a major post-earnings move helping counter a steep decline in late January. Rival Encore Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECPG\" title=\"Encore Capital Group, Inc.\">ECPG</a>) has done considerably better over that period, and the discrepancy between these two companies across multiple metrics remains stark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull argument for PRA Group remains that there is a pool of assets here that can be managed better and generate substantially higher financial returns, and when those improvements come through, they should drive a substantial rerating. The main bearish counterpoint remains the fact that it really is not a “when” and is very much an “if”—there are no guarantees that the new CEO and the latest operational restructuring will meaningfully close what has been a growing operational gap with Encore over several years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Stronger Fourth Quarter Helps The Turnaround Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll go into the drivers of PRA Group’s current predicament a little later, but suffice it for now to say that the issues here cannot and will not be fixed in a matter of quarters. Even so, good results are good results, and <a href=\"https://ir.pragroup.com/2026-02-26-PRA-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth-quarter</a> performance should improve sentiment and confidence around the near-term trajectory of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue rose about 15% this quarter, beating expectations by about 13%. Portfolio income (the more reliable revenue driver and the one more tied to core operating performance) rose more than 14%, while expected recoveries rose 16%, helped by 14% growth in excess recoveries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash collections grew almost 14% as reported, or about 10% in constant currency. U.S. Core collections rose 19%, while bankruptcy collections were down 7%; the latter can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Core European collections were up 8% in constant currency, while bankruptcy collections were down 23%. Collections from other markets (Brazil, Australia, et al.) were flat in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core operating expenses were up only about 4%, helping drive 80bp year-over-year improvement in the cash efficiency ratio to 61.4%. Operating income rose 33%, and PRA Group reported a very large EPS beat relative to sell-side expectations ($1.46 vs. $0.50).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio purchases were down 27% yoy and up 23% qoq, with core US purchases down 37% yoy. Estimated remaining collections were up 15% yoy and almost 3% qoq (to $8.61B), while average receivables rose about 13% yoy and 1% qoq.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Lot Of Work Remains</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fourth quarter was inarguably better than expected, but a look at Encore’s <a href=\"https://encorecapital.gcs-web.com/static-files/e02cfdf1-86f8-4d9c-bfde-7218f8dbd9c3\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth-quarter</a> performance underscores that there is still a major performance gap here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Encore saw similar year-over-year growth in ERC (up 14%) on lower receivables growth (up 2%), and portfolio revenue rose about 13% on 21% growth in cash collections. Purchases were down 34% yoy, and the amounts purchased by each company were broadly similar ($315M for PRAA and $327M for Encore). Cash efficiency at Encore improved significantly year over year to 57.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the gaps are really noticeable is in their respective collections and portfolio yields. PRA Group improved its collection yield (cash collections divided by average receivables) by 30bp yoy to 45.9%, while Encore’s rose 280bp to 62%. Portfolio yield (portfolio revenue divided by receivables) improved 30bp to 22.7% at PRA Group and declined 80bp to 35.1% at Encore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe these gaps go a long way toward explaining the divergent performances at the two companies and why/how PRA Group has struggled to regain any real traction in earnings growth or market sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are multiple potential drivers of different yields, including PRA’s larger European business, but the reality is that Encore is better at analyzing charged-off paper for collectability (and paying appropriate amounts) and then also better at collecting on those debts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the two companies do not provide readily comparable data about their portfolios, both buy a lot of credit card debt, including substantial amounts where there have been prior collection attempts. To that end, then, I don’t think there are material ongoing differences in the portfolios that explain the difference (I don’t believe PRA necessarily buys riskier paper and takes a “win big/lose big” approach, for instance). I believe Encore is simply better at modeling expected recoveries and/or takes a more conservative approach with those models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also believe that Encore out-executes in the collections process, including payer segmentation, collector productivity, and collections strategy. PRA Group management has talked recently about making better use of technology, and this could certainly help collections yield through automation, analytics, payer engagement, and settlement strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps counterintuitively, PRA Group’s cost efficiency may actually be a bit of an issue—I don’t have the data to assert this as fact, but Encore may be making better use of legal collections channels (which are more expensive), simply operating with more collections activity intensity, and/or offering more settlements to enhance recoveries. Clearly something is working better for Encore, as they are trouncing PRA Group in portfolio and collections yields despite a less efficient cash cost structure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the above in mind, the fact that PRA Group has offshored about a third of their U.S. collections activity and cut 115 corporate/overhead positions (for an estimated $20M/year in savings) is nice, but not necessarily going to solve any of the real issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put simply, perhaps too simply, PRA Group has to improve its pre-buy analysis of charged-off paper and make sure they’re more accurately modeling collections and paying appropriate prices. They also have to improve their collections efficiency; while there are enough differences in the two companies’ portfolios that the yields may never match (some paper will simply take longer to collect on, for instance), the numbers suggest that PRA simply isn’t managing the collections process as effectively as it needs to—and that’s down to hiring the right people (and keeping them) and having the right technology to monitor and enhance the collections process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management explicitly mentioned that it was seeing the benefits of improved buying selectivity, and that suggests that recent acquisition vintages will perform better than has been the case in prior years. That’s a good foundation, but the company has to build on it. To that end, I’d note that management’s guidance for portfolio acquisitions in 2026 ($1B-$1.3B) doesn’t suggest much growth, so revenue growth will have to come from enhanced collections efficacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If PRA Group is turning around, it will still take time for the benefits to show. There’s already evidence that recent acquisitions are performing better, but improved collections efficiency and fundamentally better acquisition strategies will take time to develop, mature, and show up in the numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe PRA Group could generate better than 20% earnings growth in 2026, and with a good supply of charged-off paper and operational improvements, I think double-digit growth is possible over the next five years, with longer-term core earnings growth in the high single digits. This, too, should support strong double-digit free cash flow growth that will help reduce leverage, continue to fund portfolio growth, and leave some room for further returns of capital to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Between discounted cash flow and core earnings, I believe fair value is in the $20 to $22.50 range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company badly needs a steady period of improved execution, and it’s too soon to say if that’s going to happen. If PRA Group can improve its analytics and execution, there is substantial upside here, but that is the consummate “Spartan if.” Management is saying the right things, including embracing more technology in its purchasing and collections process to better leverage years of collected data, but investors have seen this before. The upside potential is meaningful if this is in fact a real turn in the business, but this is a name only suitable for investors who can tolerate high levels of operational/execution risk.</p>",

After a difficult 2024 and 2025 due to weak consumer confidence, elevated food inflation, and high interest rates, investors seemed to have largely given up on the sector as they saw the average consumer struggle. These reasons led to underperformance, which ultimately led to consistent guidance and estimate cuts and multiple compression. Management teams and analysts are tired of continuously reducing estimates and have set the bar very low. The setup now looks asymmetric—sector estimates and valuations imply continued stress for consumers, meaning we don’t need a massive recovery for stocks in the sector to perform well; we just need conditions to stop getting worse.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Background</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index</a> ended the year in the low 60s, well below its long-term average near 80 and even below levels seen during the Global Financial Crisis. When sentiment is that depressed, expectations tend to skew heavily to the downside. This implies limited downside if things stay soft but meaningful upside if conditions stop getting worse / improve at the margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"936\" data-height=\"524\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consumer Sentiment Index\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Survey of Consumers, University of Michigan.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After two years of cutting guidance and watching estimates move lower, expectations for 2026 are now extremely modest. According to Goldman Sachs (Consumer Staples 2026 Outlook published in January), staples earnings estimates were cut by roughly 5% over the course of 2025, driven by volume softness and elevated promotional activity. Management teams have responded by resetting the bar, aiming to avoid further guide-downs. The chart below shows how long growth expectations are for Staples vs. the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"756\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consumer Staples expectations vs S&amp;P 500\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Wells Fargo 2026 Consumer Staples Outlook.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first reason why I believe the consumer should stabilize in the near term is federal policies due to mid-term elections approaching. This means policymakers have an incentive to introduce policies to help the average consumer. A near-term example is tax refunds. According to Wells Fargo (<a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/ed999074-45da-4ba7-92df-9fd7b06e80a7.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tax Refund Season Report</a>), the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to reduce household tax liabilities by roughly $150 billion in 2026, or about 0.5% of GDP. On average, this equals roughly $800–850 per tax filer, with a meaningful portion of those refunds arriving early in the year. Because lower- and middle-income households typically spend rather than save tax refunds, incremental income often flows into everyday categories such as groceries, beverages, and household essentials—areas where staples companies generate most revenue. Some examples would be perhaps you take your family out more than usual, or you host 1-2 more gatherings. Perhaps you go to more events / concerts / movies where you would spend money on some snacks and drinks. Consensus estimates for the year may account for some incremental impact from the consumer improving but still remain pessimistic, given analysts have had to cut numbers consistently for the last 2 years. This means consensus is likely not accounting for any secondhand impact from the OBBA, such as the examples discussed above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason is the FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted in the US in the summer of 2026. The average consumer looks at such events as one-time opportunities and tends to participate even if that means spending a little more than initially planned. Major sporting events historically boost spending for packaged foods, beverages, beer, and snacks—core categories for consumer staples companies. This is a function of increased gatherings, watch parties, and increased tourism, which leads to incremental demand. Additionally, hosting the tournament should bring in international visitors, who tend to spend disproportionately on food and drinks. Importantly, as companies guide to 2026 and analysts set estimates for the full year, nobody is including any upside in their numbers. Beer companies (such as Constellation Brands (STZ)) in their calendar Q4 earnings have discussed a likely incremental impact from the FIFA World Cup but have not included it in their guidance because it is difficult to quantify.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third reason is high incremental margins. Consumer staples businesses generally carry high fixed costs: manufacturing plants, distribution networks, and store footprints. The last few years have shown how meaningfully profits can shrink on relatively small drops in volume. The same math works in reverse, meaning as we see some incremental volume growth due to the reasons discussed above, the incremental growth in profit margins should be disproportionate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Staples Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer staples’ forward PE ratio currently sits near the low end of its long-term range.

With policy support, modest event-driven demand, easing cost pressure, and valuations already reflecting pessimism, 2026 could turn out better than the market currently expects.</p>",

This was a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1250-bad-beat-investing/articles/5306339-what-is-going-on-with-my-silver-and-gold-mining-stocks\">long-term investing idea at BAD BEAT</a> Investing at a $1.35 basis. We have long<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> maintained a house position in this mid-tier silver name. Typically, we favor companies that can demonstrate organic growth without sacrificing the integrity of the balance sheet. For a long time this has been a challenge for the precious metal miners, we have to tell you. We saw stagnant prices outside of the slow grind higher in gold (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUSD:CUR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), silver (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR\" title=\"Silver Spot Price\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAGUSD:CUR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and base metals, with rising costs of production.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, folks, Endeavour Silver Corp. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK\" title=\"Endeavour Silver Corp.\">EXK</a></span>) spent the last 24 months attempting to bridge the gap between being a high-cost legacy producer and a modern, multi-asset senior producer. Shares have absolutely skyrocketed on the back of the huge surge in metals prices. While the stock is expensive at first glance, when we consider. The <a href=\"https://edrsilver.com/site/assets/files/14787/edr_q4_2025_financial_results_tc_3_items.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s Q4</a> and fiscal year 2025 results, released just this morning, confirm that the growth has arrived, but it has come with a hefty price tag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we are neutral on the name. We still hold it, and if prices stay elevated, it will translate to more earnings and justify the share price. Let us discuss.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Financial and Operating Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the market is cheering the 115% jump in revenue, we are taking a bit more measured approach as long-term shareholders. The transition from developer to a 15-million-ounce-equivalent producer is notoriously fraught with ramp-up costs and issues, and Endeavour’s Q4 numbers, in our opinion, certainly reflect a company that is currently larger, yet significantly more complex to manage. That all said, 2025 was, by any operational metric, a transformational period for Endeavour (and many other miners too). The company reported record revenue of $467.5 million, more than doubling the $217.6 million seen in 2024. This was driven by a 48% increase in silver equivalent (AgEq) production, which reached 11.2 million ounces.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Costs High, Earnings Light All Things Considered</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bottom line tells a different story. Despite the massive run-up in prices, Endeavour still reported a net loss of $119.1 million for the year. Much of this, of course, was tied to $126.2 million in derivative revaluation losses and $14.5 million in finance charges related to debt restructuring. While these are largely non-cash or one-time items and get adjusted out, they do underscore the volatility inherent in Endeavour’s aggressive capital structure, so it was worth mentioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, we mentioned costs above. That is more concerning. Specifically, it is the trend in All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC). For 2025, AISC landed at a staggering $31.52 per silver ounce, a 32% increase over the previous year. Even with realized silver prices averaging over $40/oz in 2025, the margin of safety is thinner than we would like to see for a company of this scale. Of course, silver is now much higher, but these are huge costs. Remarkably, the company only made $0.02 per share this quarter and lost $0.03 on the year. This again is all cost-related. Let's talk operations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Q4 2025 Operational Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline of Q4 in our mind was the successful declaration of commercial production at Terronera on October 1, 2025. In its first full quarter, the mine contributed 1.0 million AgEq ounces. While throughput was slightly ahead of schedule at 1,676 tpd, grades were lower than the life-of-mine average as the company focused on lower-grade zones during the initial ramp-up. We expect grades to normalize in the second half of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Guanaceví, the company’s bread-and-butter mine, for lack of a better analogy, recovered well from the 2024 trunnion failure, with throughput up 78% year-over-year. It remains the anchor of the portfolio, producing 3.9 million ounces of silver for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The newly acquired Kolpa mine in Peru is also beginning to contribute, adding significant base metal credits (lead and zinc) to the mix. However, the integration of a Peruvian asset into a historically Mexican-focused management team adds a layer of jurisdictional and operational risk that has yet to be fully de-risked. Meanwhile, the sale of the aging Bolañitos mine, expected to close this quarter, should help streamline management’s focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead on Endeavour Silver</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour’s 2026 guidance is ambitious, calling for 14.6 to 15.6 million AgEq ounces. This would represent another ~35% growth in output. One thing that we really like is that the company is trying to rein in its cost structure, guiding 2026 AISC down to the $27–$28 range. That would be welcomed. While this reduction is a step in the right direction, it still leaves Endeavour as one of the higher-cost producers in the silver sector. For comparison, peers with similar production profiles are targeting AISC in the low $20s. The capital-intensive nature of the Pitarrilla project and the ongoing inflationary pressures in Mexico suggest that meeting this $27 guidance is easier said than done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK/earnings/estimates\">consensus right</a> now is for $0.98 in adjusted EPS. That would mean just 14X roughly for what is some 6,000% growth. But the estimates are wide around this mark, ranging from $0.31 to $1.46. It will come down to those costs, and that is a big question mark. And should metal prices abate a bit more, the earnings power will be at the lower end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We do note that the company ended the year with a healthy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK/balance-sheet\">cash position</a> of $215.4 million, bolstered by a $350 million convertible note offering in December. Liquidity is not the issue here right now. Efficiency is what 2026 will be all about. What we see here is that the company has successfully built out its growth potential, and at large costs. We do think that the start-up of Terronera and the acquisition of Kolpa have fundamentally changed the company’s production profile.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, until the company can demonstrate that this increased scale leads to meaningful, repeatable net earnings, and we get AISC down meaningfully (ideally under $25), we find it hard to issue a buy rating. As such, we are hold rated. If we get two or three clean quarters of commercial production from Terronera and a reduction in costs, we will reevaluate our rating.</p>",

That's not a typo. Block is going from 10,000+ employees to under 6,000.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875898-block-inc-xyz-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Earnings Call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI tools allow a smaller team to build more, faster. That much we have already learned from the SaaSpocalypse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is responding to what it is seeing, which is:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>40%+ increase in code shipped per engineer</p></li> <li><p>Faster product velocity</p></li> <li><p>Leaner cost structure.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, Block has realized it can do the same with less, and that’s exactly what the company is doing, something the market has applauded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you raise gross profit modestly but slash operating expenses, earnings explode. That’s exactly what the 2026 guide reflects: 54% Operating Income growth on 18% gross profit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But underneath, this doesn't change the core issues that Block faces.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I Would Sell</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, in my view, is not how AI efficiency should work. I, in fact, discussed as much in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875518-did-nvidia-just-prove-citrini-wrong\">my recent rebuttal </a>of Citrini’s article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI increases productivity. For companies that aren’t doing great, like Block, this is a lifeline that can help the company with a one-time productivity gain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real winners of AI will be those who actually see the productivity gains and double down on them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A growing company should see that engineers are 40% more efficient and hire more engineers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that’s not the case with Square.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a company with single-digit gross profit growth and guidance and core products that have failed to differentiate themselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How is Cash App better than Venmo? How is Square better than any other PoS system?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve Seen This Before</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1448\" data-height=\"1282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"567\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ Valuation <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, we’ll give it to the bulls. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ/valuation/metrics\">valuation</a> does look compelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a forward PEG below one and a 10x Price/Fwd cash flow, this looks like a good buy here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But we’ve seen this story before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market doesn’t like to pay for companies that are in secular decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, I am once again using the PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) comparison, and I think it’s very apt when it comes to Block.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other Considerations (Risks)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, there are many other risks to consider when it comes to this company. Competition is intense, and Square isn’t the only one gaining from AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, with 40% of the workforce gone, this now increases XYZ execution risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Square is going to look very different after this mass layoff, and the company must make the right choices in terms of who to keep.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, those who do stay have to have the motivation and incentive to try to keep this company going beyond 2026, and I don’t see a clear plan in place.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s easy to get excited about AI efficiency, I think the market is misreading this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see a 40% layoff as a sign of weakness, and even if 2026 is a good year for Square, the future is not bright.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The fall in reported revenue reflected currency movements and the impact of divestments, including the non-US Smokers’ Health business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, while the organic revenue growth was welcome, it was below the company’s own medium-term expectations. That was pinned primarily on a “weak” cold &amp; flu season (good for people, not so good for Haleon) and low consumer confidence in North America. I see both as ongoing risks that could affect revenue performance again in the coming year. However, for 2026, the firm guided for organic revenue growth of 3-5%. As a range that falls slightly below the medium-term target range of 4-6% annual organic revenue growth, although it still allows for the target to be met depending on where in the range actual performance ends up landing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it came to profitability, reported numbers grew 9% at the operating level and 18% for diluted earnings per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That strikes me as a very credible performance. This was put down to ongoing productivity improvements and disciplined investment. Disciplined investment can mean efficient spending, or it can mean cutting back on spending that does not show much in the short term, but then shows further down the line, so in years to come it will be worth keeping an eye on whether this so-called disciplined investment is hurting the brand equity of the company’s products, as premium branding is core to its business model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, as well as over the medium term, the company is targeting high-single-digit adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency. That strikes me as a fairly tough target on sluggish to modest revenue growth, so I’ll be keeping an eye on marketing spend and apparent effectiveness.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broad-Based Performance Continues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The flu season mentioned above ate into respiratory health revenues, while oral health grew strongly thanks in part to innovations such as Sensodyne’s Clinical platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But overall the key takeaway was that there is no problem category for now, with most of them ticking over rather than performing strongly (oral health being the exception).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"995\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Haleon 2025 preliminary results by category\" width=\"640\" height=\"212\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company preliminary results announcement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where I do see more grounds for concern is at the geographic segment level.

But ongoing weakness in North America is a risk for 2026, as many U.S. consumers are clearly feeling the squeeze financially (in a supermarket in Miami recently, a friend asked me since when regular brand chips were sold for $6, $7, or $8 a packet, and while it’s a different and more discretionary product category than Haleon’s, the point stands more broadly I think: not only have prices shot up since 2020, but consumers notice it, feel it, and make decisions on the basis of it in many cases).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even more alarming in the U.S. is that Haleon said that, despite its revenue decline there last year, it grew slightly ahead of a declining market). Breaking down the North America performance, the two declining categories were respiratory health (which could be pinned on the flu season) and Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements, which registered a low-single-digit decline. Centrum declined and then picked up in the second half, but in a tight economy, especially, branded supplements feel vulnerable to cheaper store labels, and I see this as a risk for 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Dividend Growth Story Remains Strong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently Haleon yields 1.8%, which I regard as pretty unattractive in the London market right now, given the FTSE 100 is yielding around 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Haleon proposes to grow its full-year dividend by 7.6%. That is less than last year’s 10% but is still substantial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is plenty of spare cash to fund ongoing dividend growth in future years (which I expect), with the company planning to expend £500m on share buybacks this year. Dividend costs of £612m were only 23% of net operating cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, for the year, the net cash outflow was £855m. The company could have generated positive cash flow easily enough if it chose: £1.9bn was spent on debt repayment and share buybacks, so the cash outflow was significantly influenced by financing costs within the company’s control, not any structural issue with operating cash flows. Still, I think it’s worth keeping an eye on future cash flows, as over the medium to long term I’d expect a company like Haleon to be a sizeable free cash flow generator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don’t think the communication on that point was done well at all: the results present what is described as “strong” free cash flow of £1.9bn, not noting that that is an adjusted figure. I’m baffled as to the source of this number, repeated throughout the results and in the CFO’s opening remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874737-haleon-plc-hln-q4-2025-earnings-call-prepared-remarks-transcript\">earnings call</a>, as it does not tally with what I see as a net cash outflow (as described above), calculated by subtracting financing and investing cash flows from operating cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1043\" data-height=\"1015\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Haleon cash flow statement 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"623\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company preliminary results announcement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">I Still Think Haleon is Fully Valued</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share price growth since my last piece on the name outstripped the unadjusted earnings growth in last year’s results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That means the shares now trade at 21 times earnings.

It is, therefore, understandable that its deep undervaluation persists without momentum catalysts, like durable earnings growth. The volatility removes the appeal for long-term investors, potentially sparking marginal value rallies while consolidation and incremental downtrending remain the norm. These are the primary concerns I have and are the reason I initiated a short-term, 12-month trade, with an exit target of $4 per share, rather than a long-term investment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings Facts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, let's get a lay of the land with the objective data so that we can then analyze it without bias and according to our only logical objective: positive returns, and ideally alpha.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746838/000074683826000003/q42025earningsrelease.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 showed</a> operating leverage with revenue up by 5% year-over-year, with a non-GAAP operating margin at 18% versus 11.6% year-over-year. License and Support revenue, which is the primary high-margin engine, surged by 23% year-over-year. The Enterprise Computing Solutions segment also delivered a gross margin increase of 270 basis points, to 65.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 total contract volume was up by 53% year-over-year, and backlog reached $3.15B versus $2.84B year-over-year, supporting a near-term revenue floor and de-risking the investment somewhat, even if growth is soft. Labor savings also caused the Cloud, Applications, &amp; Infrastructure Solutions segment's gross margin to increase by 210 basis points year-over-year; if this is sustained, incremental margin could compound even on flat revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also progressed with its pension de-risking trajectory, with the deficit down to about $0.45B, which is down about $0.3B overall. An annuity buyout removed about $320M in liabilities. If the cash drag from this continues to decrease, the equity multiple could lift. Pre-pension free cash flow was +$127.7M versus the official reported <a href=\"https://www.unisys.com/siteassets/investor-relations/earnings-files/2025/4q-2025-presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">free cash flow</a> of -$217.6M from the pension funding hit. The economic objective here is to reduce the pension overhang so free cash flow becomes less volatile, favoring shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point, the investment looks pre-inflection from a structural standpoint. The company said that the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746838/000074683826000006/uis-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 uplift</a> primarily came from the timing for License and Support renewals, and with licenses recognized at renewal, lumpiness is inherent in the business model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, management's own 2026 guide undercuts the \"durable spike\" narrative. The forecast is -6.5% to -4.5% on revenue, with FCF at roughly -$25M. Licensing and Support revenue is forecast at about $415M, below FY25's $428M. This means near-term uplift is capped, and sentiment inflection really hinges on FY27.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with the backlog up on renewals, this doesn't fix near-term growth and scale economics even if it defends revenue. As such, we are left with likely consolidation and then the speculative prospect of organic growth occurring in FY27 to support a fair-value re-rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major inflection that we do know about is from de-risking and deleveraging, with most \"excess\" pre-pension cash likely going to fund and service obligations. Pension cash needs from 2026 to 2029 are $352M plus high interest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY25's Licensing &amp; Support renewal total contract value of $363M against $522M year-over-year is down by -30%. This is the highest-margin engine and clouds a strong Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ex-License and Support revenue was -1.4% in Q4, with the segment's gross margin down by 250 basis points. Digital Workplace Services gross margin was down by 540 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, $700M 10.625% secure notes are due in 2031, somewhat reducing downside resilience; the company's equity-to-asset ratio is negative and has been for a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746838/000074683826000006/uis-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI does appear</a> to be adding usage to the highest-margin stream (Licenses and Support), but management has warned of \"capability-to-advisory mismatch\" as AI evolves faster than the company's services can work to. AI might not be a near-term revenue catalyst, but it can be logically seen as an operational inflection point that exists as optionality for shareholders for now. Which way the scales will fall is yet to be seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this analysis may seem largely negative, it lays the foundation for the value reversion trade. This psychological inversion strategy states that when things look bad and the value accurately reflects this, alpha probability increases due to higher normalization and turnaround likelihood.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unisys stock looks like your classic value trap. It really only works as a low-weight optionality investment. I find it unlikely that the investment will crater in price near-term, though we do have to be aware that the post-Q4 uptick introduces short-term downside volatility risk.

Sometimes you have to have conviction despite what could go wrong, because the greatest alpha is given to those who can spot opportunity off the beaten path. In the case of Unisys, a 70% return is not guaranteed (there is lots that could go wrong), but at less than 3% of NAV, I think this microcap has a value trade in it worth pouncing on. I am buying.</p>",

For the full year, the company earned $1.67. Like many companies, BWIN adjusts GAAP financials for certain expenses; most notably, it excludes share-based compensation, as do some other firms, mainly in the tech sector. While not a cash expense, it is a real cost in the form of dilution, and I do not believe it should be excluded from financials. For the full year, it added back $71 million of share-based comp, or about $0.45/share. Otherwise, EPS is closer to $1.22; this is a significant expense that alters valuation considerations meaningfully. BWIN generated $70 million of EBITDA, up 10bps as margin expanded by 91bps to 20.1%. I would also note that immediately after quarter end, Baldwin completed its merger with CAC Group.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower premiums and accounting reduce growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic growth was just 5% in Q4, down from the 10% reported for the full year, as lower premium inflation limits growth. Beyond this, the company has seen pressure from accounting changes that delay the recognition of revenue. Plus, there has been a meaningful pullback from insurers in the Medicare Advantage space, which reduced growth. Given the fact the Administration is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/29/nx-s1-5691896/medicare-advantage-health-insurance-trump-oz-cms-upcoding\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/29/nx-s1-5691896/medicare-advantage-health-insurance-trump-oz-cms-upcoding\" target=\"_blank\">targeting</a> this program for further cuts, that weak environment may persist into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurance Advisory Solutions (“IAS”) revenue declined by 3% to $158 million, given a 2% drop in organic activity, driving a 19% drop in EBITDA to $24 million. This unit has been particularly hurt by accounting changes that delay recognizing revenue until some policies expire, which has muddled results in 2025. All else equal, they are making growth look especially weak in 2025 and will then support growth in 2026. Absent this impact, revenue and EBITDA were closer to flat from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, we are seeing a meaningful deceleration in growth, and management said there was a -15% impact on growth from deflationary trends in the property market. BWIN earns commissions that are a share of premiums. The company is seeing that insurers are cutting rates and clients are altering the exposures they are insuring, which together are greatly reducing premiums paid. Premium deflation has been a growing fear around the insurance sector, which has recaptured all margins lost during COVID. Given the fact policies are generally 6-12 months in nature, I expect this lower level of pricing to persist at least through mid-2026, driving negative organic growth in H1 and some stability in H2 as it laps easier comparisons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Underwriting, Capacity, and Technology (“UCTS”), sales jumped 11% to $130 million, driving a 30% jump in EBITDA to $30 million as margins expanded 340bps to 23%. Finally, Mainstreet Insurance Solutions (“MIS”) revenue grew 7% to $77 million; however, this was entirely due to M&amp;A, with organic growth down 4%. Still, thanks to achieving targeted cost synergies, EBITDA grew 25% to $24 million as margins expanded 460bps to 32%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leverage is a concern</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the quarter, Baldwin generated $11 million of free cash flow, bringing the full-year total to $87 million. This was down by $5 million from last year. As noted above, it paid out about $71 million of share-based compensation, which accounts for the vast majority of free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Baldwin targets 3-4x leverage, and it ended the year at 4.1x, a bit above the high end. Pro forma for the CAC Group acquisition, leverage is up towards 4.5x. The company has no maturities before 2029, providing significant financial flexibility. Alongside results, the company announced a $250 million share repurchase program, and management stated this would be the “priority.” As such, I do not expect rapid deleveraging, and BWIN is likely to run at more aggressive leverage for some time to take advantage of the share price decline.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1022\" data-height=\"126\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"79\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Baldwin</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the company issued over $500 million of stock to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20326399-the-baldwin-group-and-cac-group-to-merge-creating-the-largest-majority-colleague-owned#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20326399-the-baldwin-group-and-cac-group-to-merge-creating-the-largest-majority-colleague-owned#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">acquire</a> CAC Group. I continue to struggle with Baldwin’s capital allocation policy. Using equity to fund a purchase even after such a large decline suggests management does not view the stock as overly cheap. At the same time, it is now going to start buying back this stock, even though leverage is running higher than it targets. This is a reason I remain cautious about just how accretive this acquisition will be. I expect it will take multiple years to complete this buyback authorization.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook is consistent with my view</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking forward, the company is targeting just over $2 billion of revenue this year, aided by the CAC acquisition. CAC is expected to contribute $72 million of Q1 revenue and about $310 million for the year. This implies mid-single or higher organic growth. As noted above, the company grew 5% in Q4. The insurance premium rate headwind pressure on YoY growth should fade in H2, and accounting deferrals should be less of a pressure. So all else equal, we should see growth in the 5%-7% area in my view, consistent with this guidance. Given ongoing cost-cutting and tech consolidation, it is targeting modest margin expansion. All in, this leads to guidance for $2.00-$2.10 of EPS.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1067\" data-height=\"174\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"104\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Baldwin</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in December, I was targeting $1.70 of EPS (including $0.30 of share-based compensation), given an underlying view of $2.00. Guidance is consistent with my December outlook. The midpoint is slightly higher, but this is primarily due to the fact that the CAC acquisition closed a bit earlier than I assumed, providing some incremental earnings. Management’s own run-rate assumptions are similar to my own. Given share-based comp, I now expect EPS of $1.70-$1.75, and I believe this is the more appropriate earnings figure to use when considering valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares are cheap enough to buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $22.50, shares are now just 13x earnings. This is certainly not expensive, even as the company is carrying excess debt. That said, fears that AI could disrupt insurance brokerage activity have been a meaningful recent headwind, and we have seen across multiple sectors how AI fears can drive outsized impacts on share prices. Baldwin connects counterparties, and theoretically, this type of activity is an area where AI could excel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In practice, I view more commoditized policies as being an area ripe for AI disruption. Consumers could certainly use AI agents to find the best car insurance quote, for example. I view Baldwin’s Medicare practice as having the largest AI cannibalization risk. However, much of its business is tied to more specialty, commercial policies that are one-off or unique. I expect it will be more difficult to use AI and totally remove the relationship nature of the business. To an extent, one’s view of this comes down to how much you believe the human and relationship aspect of business is a value-add or a friction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do not view it as a friction, which is why I see AI as unlikely to completely upend the business, especially as BWIN should be able to offset some revenue pressure with cost savings by deploying the technology itself. Frankly, at ~13x earnings, I think shares are attractive, and my one hesitancy is its capital allocation policy whereby its debt load remains a concern, and I am cautious about CAC acquisition benefits.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with this pressure, I view ~15x as a more reasonable multiple, or about $25.75, especially as there should be some incremental EPS contribution from CAC in 2027 as costs are taken out. As such, even after today’s rally, I see over 10% upside and am upgrading shares to a \"Buy.\"</p>",

Notice in the chart below that after the severe plunge from Q3 2021 through 2022, shares are simply rangebound. Amid many headlines and media focus, the chart has to prove itself. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I see near-term resistance near $72, while support is down at $57.

A breakdown could portend a drop to the low $40s. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For now, with a flat long-term 200-day moving average, it’s a battle between the bulls and bears. Moreover, there’s a high amount of volume by price up to the low $80s.
