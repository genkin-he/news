(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a></span>). Shares of the company plummeted 18.2% after management <a href=\"https://ir.chipotle.com/2025-10-29-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.chipotle.com/2025-10-29-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Revenue fell a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> bit short of expectations. But earnings per share came in line with what analysts were anticipating. More disappointing than these results, however, was the fact that management reduced guidance for comparable store sales for this year because of consumer headwinds. In the past, I have been more neutral on the business, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752475-chipotle-mexican-grill-great-for-tastebuds-not-wallet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752475-chipotle-mexican-grill-great-for-tastebuds-not-wallet\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">even reaffirming it</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as a \"Hold\" candidate back in January of this year. The fact of the matter is that shares were too expensive for my liking, even though I am a huge fan of the restaurant. However, the thing that stopped me from downgrading it to a \"Sell\" was the fact that the company was continuing to achieve impressive growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to today, and things are not going well. The stock is down 45.6% over the last year, with management now warning that comparable restaurant sales will be down this year as opposed to flat. For many investors, this would be an ideal time to cash out and look elsewhere for opportunities. However, I actually think now might be the time to step in and upgrade it. To be clear, the company has difficult days ahead for it, and I fully expect conditions to worsen before they get better. The U<span>nited States</span> is spiraling toward a recession, in my opinion, and I fully anticipate consumer pressures to hurt the company more than they have already. Normally, the kind of valuation that the firm trades at would justify a neutral rating, though just barely. But with the company still focused tremendously on growth and with it having no debt and a huge amount of cash on hand, I think that those who are in it for the long haul should consider it a very soft \"Buy\" candidate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tough Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the market closed on Oct. 29, the management team at Chipotle Mexican Grill announced financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Revenue for the company came in at $3 billion, which was up from the $2.79 billion reported last year, but it also ended up missing analysts’ <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/earnings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">expectations</a> by $19.1 million. In the grand scheme of things, this kind of miss is mostly a rounding error. However, when you have a restaurant operator that has historically been priced like a technology company, even meeting expectations can result in downside if the market catches even a whiff of weakness ahead. In short, Chipotle Mexican Grill has been priced for perfection, and it has fallen short of that.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2226\" data-height=\"854\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall growth in revenue for the company came from a rise in the number of locations that it has in operation, from 3,615 last year to 3,916 this year. There was also a slight increase in comparable store sales, amounting to 0.3%. But that's far worse than the 6% increase that the company saw in the same quarter last year on a year-over-year basis. What was really problematic is the fact that the comparable store sales for the company were driven entirely by higher prices, with the average check rising by 1.1%. At the same time as this, the number of transactions dropped by 0.8%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2136\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not a big believer in the value of anecdotes. But the second investment book that I ever read was One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch. In that book, I became fascinated by the fact that he would often physically check in on the companies that he was considering buying to get a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the business in person. Keeping in mind that a single visit to a single location does not offer significant value if our goal is to get an understanding of the health of the business as a whole, I would like to mention that just a month ago, I visited one of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants near my home. I am a big fan of its food, and I consider myself a foodie. I was shocked when, probably around 1:00 PM, I walked in and was the only customer for the business to service. The number of employees seemed low, and honestly, the food was not as fresh as it should have been. It was a rather disappointing experience for a chain that has a history of lines going to or even exiting out of its doors.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2060\" data-height=\"882\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I should have used that experience to buy some put options on the stock, but I didn't. However, I doubt that this is so much a company-specific issue as it is a consumer issue. Management continues to focus on innovations, including those involving its menu and investing in digital orders. In fact, the firm went from generating 34% of its food and beverage sales through digital means in the third quarter of last year to generating 36.7% of them at the same time this year. I think the bigger problem is precisely what management hit on, which is that consumer headwinds and macroeconomic challenges remain a problem.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1518\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Confidence\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"425\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's be honest: when it comes to food, Chipotle Mexican Grill is not the go-to place if your goal is to maintain a strict budget. It's the place that you go to if you want food that is of a higher quality and don't mind paying a little bit more than what fast food joints would charge you. During difficult times, I would imagine that Chipotle Mexican Grill would struggle. As I have detailed in other articles, like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829256-trump-100-percent-tariff-on-china-may-cause-economy-to-spiral-toward-recession\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829256-trump-100-percent-tariff-on-china-may-cause-economy-to-spiral-toward-recession\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808493-a-recession-is-coming-are-you-prepared\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808493-a-recession-is-coming-are-you-prepared\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, the U.S. economy seems to be heading toward a recession. Jobs data is getting worse almost by the month. And with tariffs now at play, there is a real risk of economic contraction in the near future. I have been arguing this since August. It is the first time in my professional career that I have ever said a recession is practically guaranteed. Even consumer confidence is near an all-time low, as the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT\" target=\"_blank\">chart</a> above illustrates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1948\" data-height=\"898\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Costs\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though revenue for the company increased, the profitability worsened. Earnings per share did rise from $0.28 to $0.29. But that was only thanks to a change in share count. Overall net income grew from $387.4 million to $382.1 million. In the chart above, you can see important costs in relation to overall revenue. The good news is that food, beverage, and packaging expenses have actually gotten a bit better for the company. But other costs are on the rise, including labor expenses and occupancy costs. The big problem, however, seems to be its <span>\"</span>other operating costs,\" which rose from 13.83% of sales to 15%. Management blamed this on increased marketing and promotional activities and lower sales volumes. Fortunately, as the first chart in this article illustrates, cash flow metrics for the business at least improved.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2266\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see financial results for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time last year. In this case, results did improve across the board. But overall, the company remains challenged. So far, comparable restaurant sales this year are down 1.4%, even though the company benefited to the tune of 1.3% from higher prices. But again, consumer confidence is incredibly weak right now, and even small price increases can have an impact on traffic. In fact, the number of transactions that the company saw was down 2.7% year over year. Until economic conditions improve or until management can do something to draw more customers into its doors, such as effective promotions, menu cost reductions, or new and innovative offerings at its restaurants, I expect worsening economic conditions to lead to more of this pain as time goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has even had to reduce guidance for this year. Earlier in the year, they anticipated that overall comparable restaurant sales would be mostly flat. But now they expect them to be down at a low single-digit rate. Despite this, the company is pushing forward with its growth plans. It still intends to open between 315 and 345 locations this year, with 80% of those boasting a Chipotlane. According to some <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a>, a Chipotlane typically boosts overall restaurant sales by between 10% and 15%, also leading to greater margins and overall returns. So it is great to see investments being made in these.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next year, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835032-chipotle-mexican-grill-inc-cmg-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835032-chipotle-mexican-grill-inc-cmg-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">intends</a> to push growth even further, opening between 350 and 370 locations. That will involve between 10 and 15 international locations as the company continues to focus on a population that is drastically larger than what the U<span>nited States</span> consists of. This does not mean that the company will slow down its growth in North America anytime soon. In fact, management expects to eventually expand its physical footprint to 7,000 restaurants in North America.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1794\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"322\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This kind of growth justifies, in my view, the stock as a very soft \"Buy\" rating at this time. If we project our results based on what we have seen already this year, we would expect net profits of $1.54 billion, adjusted operating cash flow of $2.14 billion, and EBITDA of $2.32 billion. Using these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently valued. Relative to what the company was valued at using data from last year, shares are a bit cheaper. But not radically so. The stock is certainly cheaper than it was when I last wrote about it. And now, as you can tell by looking at the table below, it is priced around the middle of what other similar enterprises are priced at. Considering its growth trajectory and potential, and adding on top of this the fact that it has no debt and has $698.7 million of cash on its books, I think that there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company</strong></td> <td><strong>Price/Earnings</strong></td> <td><strong>Price/Operating Cash Flow</strong></td> <td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill</strong></td> <td><strong>29.7</strong></td> <td><strong>21.3</strong></td> <td><strong>19.4</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Starbucks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX\" title=\"Starbucks Corporation\">SBUX</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>36.2</strong></td> <td><strong>19.4</strong></td> <td><strong>21.8</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>The Cheesecake Factory (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAKE\" title=\"The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated\">CAKE</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>15.1</strong></td> <td><strong>7.8</strong></td> <td><strong>12.8</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>196.0</strong></td> <td><strong>20.6</strong></td> <td><strong>23.7</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dutch Bros.

Management does need to do certain things to draw more customers in.

This simply means that the management team has done a similar job as their peers. We can observe that until recently only VVR was the outperformer from this cohort. However, in the past year FRA has outperformed both VVR and JFR. We will explore shortly why, in the Premium/Discount section.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Premium/Discount to NAV</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA has outperformed its peers this year, not due to outstanding management decisions, but the market perception of its peers:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">JFR and VVR seem to have a bigger retail investor base, base which started pricing in lower Fed Funds and the changing macro environment. FRA has lagged in doing so, with the CEF still at an astounding premium to NAV of 2.3%. We are of the opinion this state of affairs will change, with the CEF set to move to a discount as the market prices correctly the current macro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since historically FRA does not show any alpha to its peers, it is set to being valued similarly, i.e. at a discount. We shall show you the macro drivers responsible for this.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro drivers: lower fed funds and tight spreads</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leveraged loans are floating rate, meaning they pay SOFR plus a spread. As Fed Funds move lower, SOFR moves lower, hence the all-in yield paid by leveraged loans decreases. What does this mean? It means in such an environment investors tend to move away from floating rate assets into fixed rate assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 29, 2025 the Fed <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/30/fed-cuts-key-rate-yet-powell-says-future-reductions-are-not-locked-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">cut</a> rates yet again, bringing the effective Fed Funds target rate to 3.75%-4%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors can debate where the neutral rate lies, but one thing is certain: rates are moving lower. Is the neutral rate 3% or is it 2%? One can debate this for a while, but at the end of the day SOFR is headed lower, and all-in yields for leveraged loans are headed lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second macro headwind for leveraged loans is made up of tight credit spreads. We have compressed to a level in spreads that is at the bottom of a 10-year range. This simply means the market is very complacent, and during a risk-off event spreads are headed higher. Higher spreads means lower prices for leveraged loans, which means a lower NAV for a fund like FRA. While we do not have a crystal ball to predict the exact timing, it will eventually happen in the next 12 months. It is just a matter of time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current dividend is unsustainable</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEF is currently paying a 11.88% distribution, but this level is unsustainable:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"646\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"section\" width=\"640\" height=\"294\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Section 19a <span>(Company)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even before the most recent Fed action, the CEF was paying out an unsustained dividend. As we can see from its August 2025 Section 19a notice, the CEF was using 32% return of capital. This is a very large figure that will become larger as lower rates percolate down the holdings. Please note many leveraged loans are set off 3-months SOFR, meaning a lower Fed Funds level will take a few months to translate into a lower all-in yield. It is coming however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the above 32% ROC figure gives us an actual cash supported distribution of below 9%. That level will be cemented by lower Fed Funds. Math points towards a cut in the distribution rate to make it more sustainable. We see the fund moving to a 9% or 10% distribution rate in the next few months, thus still using ROC but a lower amount of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors hate distribution cuts, and we believe that is why we have not seen this yet happen, but the management team will not have a choice.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA is a leveraged loan CEF. The name is negatively impacted by lower Fed Funds, and has an overhang in terms of tight credit spreads. Surprisingly the CEF is still trading at a premium to NAV while its peers are at discounts close to -10%. The fund's distribution is not supported, with the latest Fed cut suggesting a supported cash distribution closer to 9%. We are of the opinion that the CEF will end up cutting its distribution and moving to a discount to NAV, thus putting pressure on its price.</p>",

This reexamination of the stock will concentrate on the top 2 in my assessment: the release of its Panther Lake chips in early October and also the release of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4507834-intel-non-gaap-eps-of-0_23-beats-by-0_22-revenue-of-13_7b-beats-by-560m\">FQ3 earnings report</a> (\"ER\"). In the remainder of this article, I will explain why these developments keep generating conflicting signals and clouding the stock’s return/risk profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me start with the positives. The release of its Panther Lake (see the photo below showing Intel CEO <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-unveils-panther-lake-architecture-first-ai-pc-platform-built-on-18a#:~:text=Intel%20Unveils%20Panther%20Lake%20Architecture,%28credit:%20intel%20corporation%29.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lip-Bu Tan</a> holding one of the wafters) marks the first client SoCs built on Intel’s 18A technology. The release was quickly reviewed by many other analysts. Thus, here I will only focus on an aspect – a crucial aspect in my view - that received little attention: the power efficiency boost. Compared to previous generations, 18A can reduce power consumption by up to 40% at the same performance level as detailed in the following CRN analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em><a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/2025/intel-shares-details-of-forthcoming-intel-18a-chips-crucial-to-its-comeback\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRN news (Oct 9, 2025):</a> The company also boasted of Panther Lake featuring greater than 40 percent more NPU TOPS per area than Lunar Lake, whose NPU maxed out to 48 TOPS. In addition, Intel said that Panther Lake will require more than 30 percent less power than the Core Ultra Series 2 desktop chips formerly known as Arrow Lake to provide a similar level of multi-threaded CPU performance. At a system-on-chip level, Panther Lake will use up to 10 percent lower power than Lunar Lake and as much as 40 percent less power than Arrow Lake.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, I will detail the implications of such power efficiency boost and explain why it could potentially help to expand the adoption of INTC’s 18A for AI applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"851\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"A person holding a circular object in front of a sign AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Intel</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI cost structure</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among all the roadblocks (technological, legal, ethical, et al.) behind AI applications, power consumption is a crucial one, yet less often discussed issue, in my view. AI power demand has been rising rapidly in recent years, and is projected to keep growing in the years to come. For example, the following forecast from DNV projects a tenfold increase in AI power consumption in the next 5~6 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1174\" data-height=\"844\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of data on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DNV forecast</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic, social, and environmental implications of meeting such an enormous power demand is as important as the AI technology itself in my mind. Since this is an investing analysis, I will refrain myself from rumbling and only focus on the economic aspect. Such a power demand directly translates into an outsized electricity bill for end AI users. To obtain a back-of-envelop estimate, I gleaned the following parameters from a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/09/08/what-large-models-cost-you--there-is-no-free-ai-lunch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forbes report</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p></p> <ul> <li><em>The cost of the chips amounted to millions of dollars. According to a technical overview of OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model, each training run required at least <strong>$5 million worth</strong> of GPUs.</em></li> <li><em>These models require many, many training runs as they are developed and tuned, so the final cost is far in excess of this figure. When asked at an MIT event in July whether the cost of training foundation models was on the order of <strong>$50 million to $100 million,</strong> OpenAI’s cofounder Sam Altman answered that it was “more than that” and is getting more expensive.</em></li> <li><em>The cost doesn’t end there. Running inference on the models, once trained, is also expensive. Estimates suggest that in January 2023, ChatGPT used nearly 30,000 GPUs to handle hundreds of millions of daily user requests. Sajjad Moazeni, a University of Washington assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, says those queries may <strong>consume around 1 GWh each day.</strong></em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming an electricity price of ~$0.14 per kWh (FYI - electricity costs range from about $0.12 to $0.17 per kWh depending on where you are in the U.S.), 1 GWh of power consumption means an electricity cost of $140,000 PER DAY. This in turn means $51 million per year – more than 10x of the AI chips’ upfront costs. A technology that can save up to 40% of energy use thus means an energy saving of tens of millions of dollars per year for AI developers and end users. Such significant reduction in electricity consumption and electricity cost could provide a strong competitive edge for the Panther Lake and other chips based on the 18A among for deployment in large-scale AI data centers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">INTC stock: near-term issues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, switching to the near-term developments and risks. The company reported its FQ3 ER on Oct 23 As you can see from the following chart below. Overall, INTC delivered a strong quarter with both top and bottom lines beating consensus. The company has already raised its FQ4 outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I see quite a few risks lurking beneath the good news. Here, I will focus on the top 3 in my mind: margin uncertainty, its foundry business, and also valuation. Based on the updates provided in the ER, I am concerned about a margin squeeze ahead. Judging by the ER, I expect INTC’s 10/7 nodes to be short supplied at least into FQ1 of 2026. For readers unfamiliar with the technical details, there older nodes are the more profitable and highly demanded ones. In the meantime, I don’t expect the new 18A node to reach peak capacity anytime soon (my estimate is that the 18A ramp up will last till 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For its foundry business, I don’t see a material improvement from the ER. I keep seeing slow internal adoption (e.g., for the 18A node) and also lack of large external customers given the competition in this space (e.g., vs. TSM as detailed in my earlier article). Yet, the rally of its share prices seems to have already factored in a large improvement in its external foundry revenue, as detailed next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1898\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer screen AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"113\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, Intel trades at a significantly higher P/E ratio than both foundry peers (such as TSM) and chip peers (such as AMD). INTC's forward P/E for the fiscal year 2026 (FY1) is 122x, which is over four times TSM's P/E of ~30x and nearly double AMD's P/E of 67x. With INTC’s current market capitalization (MC) of about $197 billion as of this writing, its MC would be about $108 billion only if it were to trade at the same FY1 P/E as AMD, a pure chip player.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I believe it is reasonable to assume that the market is giving its foundry business a valuation of around $90 billion. This is a quite aggressive assumption in my view for many reasons. First, I don’t believe INTC’s chip business is worth the same P/E multiple as AMD’s given the technological gap. Second, a valuation of around $90 billion is also difficult to justify for its foundry business. As a reference point, TSM, a pure foundry player, is valued at ~30x FY1 P/E and about 10x P/sales ratio as seen. Even at TSM’s ~10x P/sales and ~30x P/E ratios, a valuation of around $90 billion implies external sales of around $9 billion per years and net profit of around $3 billion per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am skeptical whether INTC’s foundry business can sustainably generate this level of revenue and/or profit in the foreseeable future. The company continued reporting an operating loss (of around $2.3 billion) in the FQ3 ER.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, this revisit to INTC was mainly triggered by 2 new developments: its 18A update and FQ3 ER. These developments keep generating conflicting signals. I see substantial potential for the 18A to help with the company’s market share in the crucially important AI space, both due to its computing performance and also power efficiencies. However, near-term dynamics remain challenging due to issues like margin uncertainty, 18A ramp up, and foundry costs. The current valuation risk is also elevated, which is based on assumptions to aggressive to justify in my model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1162\" data-height=\"282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As such, I think AWS's growth rate climbing above the 20% y/y mark is a massively positive development. And, with Amazon's $11B Project Rainier AI supercomputer <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-project-rainier-ai-trainium-chips-compute-cluster\" rel=\"nofollow\">going live yesterday</a> with more than 500K Trainium2 custom AI chips (plus, more AI infrastructure coming online in the near future), the momentum at AWS should continue in the upcoming quarters.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business. AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% YoY. We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months. </em></p> <p>- Andy Jassy, Amazon's CEO.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I see it, Amazon handily exceeded raised analyst expectations for Q3 2025, with its twin growth engine of AWS and Ads humming along beautifully.

Now, while I am impressed with Amazon's Q3 business performance, the quick jump in its stock price from ~$215 per share to ~$250 per share has rendered AMZN stock a Hold under our valuation process. This is because its updated 5-year expected CAGR return of ~13% is lower than TQI's investment hurdle rate of 15%. Henceforth, at TQI, we will be pausing the accumulation of Amazon stock for now, and wait for a better entry point that could arrive via time and/or price correction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, valuation agnostic investors and/or those seeking a low volatility, high-quality tech stock can continue to accumulate AMZN stock here in the mid-$200s with a long-term 3-5+ year investment horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> I now rate Amazon stock a \"Hold\" in the mid-$200s.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading, and happy investing!

Revenue was up 85% from last year, but all year-over-year comparisons are heavily distorted by its acquisition of the First of Long Island. Q3 represents the first full quarter of FLIC being a part of CNOB. Adjusted earnings excluded $0.08 of favorable one-time items, namely a $6.6 million benefit from an employee retention tax credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bank’s return on tangible equity accelerated nicely to 12.6% from 9.3% last quarter and 7% a year ago. A key driver of the FLIC purchase was to improve CNOB’s funding mix and enhance scale in order to drive better returns for investors. I view it as essential for a bank to earn an ROE of at least 10% to show it is meeting its cost of capital. In Q3, CNOB achieved this. We will need to see this sustained, and that in turn can help support a valuation more clearly in excess of book value. I believe it will be sustained.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet mix is better post-FLIC</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to its balance sheet, client deposits rose by about 1% sequentially and sit at $11.4 billion, up from $7.8 billion last year. While total deposits are up about 45%, noninterest-bearing balances are up over 75% to $2.5 billion. They now account for over 20% of deposits. This is not an unusually high share; rather, legacy CNOB had relatively low NIB balances. These balances are especially valuable in an elevated interest rate environment, and their presence on the balance sheet is helping to improve margins. Interest-bearing deposit costs declined to 3.31%, down 4bps sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loans grew by about 1.2% from Q2 to $11.3 billion. This, of course, was up dramatically from last year’s $8.3 billion, given the FLIC purchase. CNOB’s loan portfolio is heavily geared towards commercial real estate (“CRE”). It has $7.6 billion of CRE loans and another $700 million of construction loans. As CRE came under pressure, this exposure has been a source of concern. However, CRE appears less problematic in general—not to mention the fact that CNOB’s own underwriting has proven to be strong, as evidenced by improving credit quality (more on that below).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In particular, while the office still clearly has challenges, we are seeing employers pivot away from remote work, which is a positive for office demand, all else equal. Plus, as interest rates have come off their highs, we have seen capital market access improve, allowing more buildings to refinance and term out their debt, an additional positive. Instead, it appears that there may be more problems in private credit and corporate lending, as seen by headlines of losses over the past month. CNOB’s local and CRE-oriented loan book is much more immune to this pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, FLIC’s balance sheet had a higher share of investment securities, so the company now has $1.25 billion of securities, from $646 million last year. Its investment portfolio yields 4.27%, up 31bps from Q2, given a full quarter impact of FLIC. I expect this to be at or near the peak in yields on this portfolio. Over time, I expect the investment portfolio to become a smaller share of total assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CNOB’s net interest margin (“NIM”) expanded by 5bps sequentially to 3.11%. Importantly, it ended the quarter even stronger at 3.20%, despite a rate cut in September. This creates a very positive launching point for Q4, which should drive incremental net interest income next quarter. NIM was up 44bps from last year, primarily due to a 70bp drop in deposit costs, speaking to the benefit of FLIC’s low-cost deposit base and higher share of NIBs. In Q3, net interest income was $103 million, up 29% sequentially, primarily due to a full quarter of FLIC assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect 3-5% NII growth in Q4, given the NIM improvement we are still seeing. The company still has excess liquidity on its balance sheet as it normalizes its balance sheet post-acquisition. As it deploys this liquidity into loans and other assets, or paying off higher-cost liabilities, we should see NIM continue to improve. CNOB is maintaining a ~99% loan-to-deposit ratio for a second quarter, and I expect it to continue running right around 100%, meaning that loan and deposit growth should broadly track each other going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit quality impresses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to credit quality, during the quarter, ConnectOne took 20bps of net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets are just 28bps, nearly half of the 53bps at the start of the year. The company has $40 million of nonperforming assets, which is actually down $17 million since the start of the year, even with the addition of FLIC’s loans. That is because the bank has been able to work out 3 CRE loans that had fallen to nonaccrual status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, provisions were $5.5 million. Last quarter, it set aside $36 million, but this included $27.4 million as an initial provision against FLIC’s loans. Normalizing for this, Q2 provisions were ~$8 million, so we saw a meaningful sequential improvement here. It has $156 million of reserves for credit losses, providing about 395% coverage of nonaccrual loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Particularly in an asset-backed loan portfolio like CNOB’s, I view coverage of 250% or higher as excellent. With the level of reserves that CNOB is carrying, it is already prepared for a meaningful deterioration in credit quality. In other words, NPAs could rise materially before it has to set aside more reserves. Given I do not expect a recession or material worsening of credit quality, I expect provisions to remain low and see scope for gradual reserve releases over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">With solid capital and improving returns, CNOB is attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, CNOB has a 10.2% common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, down from 11.1% last year, given the ownership of FLIC. This is a healthy level, and CNOB can safely run the bank at about 9.5% capital in my view. As such, it has sufficient capital to ensure its 3% dividend yield is secure, grow its asset base, and likely do some share repurchases next year out of retained earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in August, I was targeting $24.25, or about 1.1x tangible book value. The company ended the quarter with a $22.85 book value. Increasingly, as we are seeing the full benefits of FLIC’s low-deposit base, I see scope for a 1.2x multiple (given a ~12% run-rate ROE). That could push shares towards $27. That can occur if we continue to see steady execution and no surprise in loans inherited from FLIC (which CNOB already does appear reserved for).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view CNOB as having discrete idiosyncratic benefits thanks to its FLIC purchase and improved balance sheet composition, which make it attractive in the regional banking sector. As such, I am upgrading shares to buy as these tailwinds become more apparent with over 12% upside.</p>",

And I suggest that this valuation is unfair to the company and the telecommunications industry as a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> whole. I will try to explain why below.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Future Needs T-Mobile</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I wonder why Wall Street rates telecommunications companies as boring value stocks and fails to see their potential. I see the potential. And in my view, it is huge. When AI development **reaches** the mass consumers, who will supply the connection for the <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/genai-impact-on-mobile-network-traffic\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased traffic</a>?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The answer is simple: it will be cellular operators and providers. Artificial intelligence is very demanding in terms of memory and traffic. That means that when it reaches the mass consumer market, people will need very good mobile communications. And lots of gigabytes and terabytes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the robots will walk the streets, or a lot of cars with different AI or autopilot features will be around. And the Internet of Things will grow, they'll probably need a SIM card and internet access. And this as I think may result in the fact that in America in 5 or 10 years, with a population of, for example, 350 million people, there will be 1 billion mobile subscribers. And most of them will be non-human.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This perspective creates a multiple growth potential for mobile operators in the future. In this case, telecommunications companies' shares will be clear growth stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Reliability</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am quite surprised by T-Mobile's P/E ratio of 20, which is significantly lower than the market average, because this indicator is unfair to a company that reliably generates revenue, even without the prospects I described above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile and the whole network operator industry in my mind is very reliable. Just ask yourself: If tomorrow there will be a crisis like in 2008 or other crisis. Will you save on your communication? I am sure that for 90% or more of people nowadays, cellular communication and smartphones have become a necessity. And people will save on communication as a last resort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It means that mobile operators are reliable companies. Yes, they are competing with each other. And yes, they are taking market share from each other. But in general, people who spend a huge amount of time on their phones these days will not give up their connection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mobile communications is the final mile to the consumer. The AI boom, yearly growth in computing power, and other stuff mean that communications are needed and it will have steady and reliable demand. However, the wave of growth sparked by AI just hasn't hit this industry yet. But I'm sure it will sooner or later.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial Profile</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's talk about finances. We start with some background information. Ten years ago, the company ranked third among mobile operators in the US, behind AT&amp;T and Verizon. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_of_Sprint_Corporation_and_T-Mobile_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">But they bought Sprint</a>, the fourth-largest operator, and jumped to the top.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This deal was closed in 2020. And this deal affected the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS\">financial performance</a>, which you can see in the table below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1548\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"princescreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"159\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile financial indicators <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total revenue grew from $44 billion in 2019 to $80 billion in 2021. Gross profit grew just as strongly as revenue. However, the company's net profit did not grow immediately after revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the expected <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-t-mobile-secured-notes-bbb-01-12-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">effect of the integration</a>. Merging two giant networks, IT systems, teams, and customer bases required huge costs. T-Mobile incurred significant expenses for dismantling Sprint's obsolete equipment, upgrading sites, integrating billing, optimizing staffing, etc. In addition, according to accounting rules, the company began to depreciate (write off) the cost of Sprint's acquired assets by billions of dollars, which also “ate into” net income. Although it was not a direct cash expense. That's why I think that the low profit level of $3 billion was unnatural and temporary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the company got through this costly period, which is confirmed by its profit growth in 2023-2025. And I think that, given the circumstances I've described, the company's current profit level can be considered stable for the combined company. That's why this basis for the P/E ratio is valid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's talk about the company's <a href=\"https://bullfincher.io/companies/t-mobile-us/revenue-by-segment\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenue structure</a>, which you can see in the following table with data for 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w640\" alt=\"self-made\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"466\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile US's revenue by segment <span>(bullfincher)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More than 81% of revenue comes from providing communication services. And as I wrote above, I don't think that people will cut back on these expenses. Therefore, I find this part of the revenue very reliable. As for the rest, which includes the sale of phones and other items that can be called ancillary businesses, their proportion is not high enough to pose a significant risk to the company's financial stability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Expansion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it's very important to say that T-Mobile bought Sprint not only because of its millions of subscribers and economies of scale. The key factor was also that Sprint had an extensive portfolio of radio frequencies, <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/t-mobile-5g-spectrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">especially in the 2.5 GHz mid-band range</a>. This frequency range is the sweet spot for 5G, offering the ideal balance between wide coverage and high bandwidth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By getting these frequencies, T-Mobile was able to quickly roll out its 5G Ultra Capacity network, which was years ahead of similar networks from competitors. Verizon and AT&amp;T finally had to spend time and billions of dollars at C-Band auctions to get similar frequency spectrum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why T-Mobile has not only successfully integrated Sprint subscribers in recent years, but also offered the market the best 5G speeds, attracting new customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After merging with Sprint, T-Mobile showed high growth rates in its customer base, actively taking customers away from Verizon and AT&amp;T due to successful price positioning and rapid deployment of its 5G network. As a result, the company's shares rose significantly in the period 2023-24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in the first half of 2025, investors saw the first signals of a slowdown in subscriber growth. This caused worry among some investors— whether T-Mobile had exhausted its potential for expansion. Especially since competitors by this time had narrowed the gap in deploying 5G networks. This and the general market correction in the spring of this year led to a lower share price for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the data for the past quarter released on October 23 is very promising. Customer base growth has accelerated, as you can see in the table below with quarterly breakdowns of indicators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Selfmade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"581\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile quarterly financial performance <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the table, the financial indicators show overall stability. Yes, there are some minor quarterly fluctuations in revenue and net income. For example, the reduction in net income in Q3 2025 may be due to a one-time factor or investments, but they are not critical in the overall picture. The company generates more than $20 billion in revenue per quarter and billions of dollars in profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, T-Mobile's position as a market leader <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20251022720694/t-mobile-delivers-record-customer-growth-fueled-by-widening-differentiation-and-focus-on-durable-and-profitable-financial-growth-raises-guidance-across-the-board\" rel=\"nofollow\">with 139,9 million customers</a> giving it an advantage of scale. This makes it possible to invest more effectively in the network, providing better coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, the third quarter report confirms the company's leading position in the market. The company continues to move forward. But that's all the details of the current moment; its biggest opportunities are still ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Looking to the Future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, investors are focusing on tech giants as pioneers in AI development, and on data center equipment manufacturers. People expect that in the future, AI will enter into every home, changing our lives and create new markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I would say this. People see that AI needs infrastructure for its “brain,” but they forget that this brain needs infrastructure for the nerves that connect it to the consumer. Without powerful, fast, and ubiquitous connectivity, the whole AI revolution will get stuck in data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that when AI reaches the mass consumer through AI assistants in smartphones, smart cars, AR/VR headsets, and robot assistants, the requirements for communication networks will dramatically change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the evolution of AI, as I wrote above, there will surely be a whole army of new cellular subscribers in the form of machines. Smart cars, drones, industrial robots, simple robots, and many other things will need to connect to the internet. And I guess traffic will increase too, because all this will require a huge flow of information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Telecom operators such as T-Mobile in that situation will be the beneficiaries of AI development. But I'll clarify that this will happen later. It's not happening just now, we don't see strong growth in the financial indicators of mobile operators yet. And my idea cannot be confirmed by figures. It is based on simple logic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI, as I understand it, has not yet reached the mass consumer in sufficient volume to transform the telecommunications market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I wrote in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825279-why-i-believe-the-market-rally-is-losing-steam\">my article on the overall market situation</a>, if we exclude high-tech companies from the calculation, the rest of the economy is stagnating. High interest rates on lending are suppressing investment activity, and consumer demand is weak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But sooner or later, the economy as a whole, not just the AI industry, will grow. The Fed's interest rates will be lower, which will allow a new credit cycle to begin. And then, I think we will see the realization of the idea I have described here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent years, T-Mobile has proven itself to be a strong and growing player in a relatively sluggish telecommunications market. It has become the leader in this market, essentially winning the competitive race. And this state of affairs, in my opinion, gives the company every chance of leading the industry's growth in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile's current valuation reflects only its current business, in an industry that the market values lower than the market average. But the market does not include the enormous growth potential that will inevitably come with the widespread adoption of AI. I expect the telecom sector to experience an AI boom in the future. And T-Mobile is the best way to bet on that future while the market has not yet recognized its value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a market capitalization of $243 billion, T-Mobile has a P/E ratio of only 20. If the share is valued not as a value stock but as a growth stock, the premium to the price will be tens of percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am sure that in the long term, the company's shares will rise significantly in price. But for the moment, I will give a cautious recommendation to Buy. I will refrain from recommending a “Strong Buy” because my thesis is based on a logic and forecast of future developments, rather than on past events reflected in the figures. And I see macroeconomic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzMJaTeOkH4\" rel=\"nofollow\">and political risks</a> for the market in the next six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the company's chart, I would strongly recommend buying the company's shares if they reach the support level marked on the chart below. This could happen if the US market as a whole turns negative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1409\" data-height=\"542\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Print screen\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T Mobile chart <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But somehow, either with support or without it, the stock will move up and rise significantly in price in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that any dip in T-Mobile stock caused by short-term market or macroeconomic factors should be used to buy or add to positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, I'd like to point out that it's possible that the market will see the potential ahead of time, and then the shares could start growing from any level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect that T-Mobile and the whole telecom sector are on the verge of a major transformation—from “boring” value companies to growth companies of the new digital era.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk, as you might guess, is the situation in the US market as a whole due to politics and macroeconomics. If a correction is ahead for the S&amp;P 500 index, T-Mobile shares will not be able to ignore it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the key risk is timing. My investment thesis is based on the expectation that the industry will be transformed by AI. But I can't say for sure when exactly this turning point will come.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there are other, more traditional risks, such as increased competition or unfavorable regulatory changes, among others. But based on my main thesis, I think these factors are less critical.</p>",

While the fund has done well<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> relative to broader equity indexes, the bar is set very high for growth funds. The following sections will break down FFLG’s holdings and compare the fund’s valuation, performance, volatility, and tradability aspects with the Russell 1000 and other growth funds.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF Description &amp; Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG seeks long-term capital appreciation through exposure to companies that Fidelity identifies as exhibiting higher revenue and earnings growth potential than the broader equity market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s investment process is based on the fundamental analysis of companies with similar market capitalization to the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 indexes, taking into consideration elements such as financial health, earnings outlook, companies’ strategy and management, along with their position in the related industry and economic outlook. A quantitative process is then applied to build the fund’s portfolio, following a high-conviction approach, while maintaining risk at appropriate levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of October 27, 2025, FFLG had $526 million in assets under management, invested across 90 holdings, with an average market cap of $739 billion, more than double that of the Russell 1000 index, represented here by the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>). The fund’s larger capitalization tilt is clear, with mega caps accounting for 67.9% of total assets, while this category makes up only 43.2% of the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s top ten holdings highlight its oversized allocation to big techs. NVIDIA (15.68%), Microsoft (9.54%), and Apple (8.66%) are the largest positions, while Amazon (6.38%), Meta Platforms (5.14%), Alphabet Class A (4.30%), and Class C (2.33%) are also overweight compared to equity market benchmarks. Broadcom (3.60%) and Taiwan Semiconductor (2.40%) reinforce the fund’s bet on the semiconductor industry, while Netflix (2.20%) is another key internet platform player.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"395\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following table presents a mix of large-cap growth funds, with the last three also relying on companies’ fundamentals in the selection process.

Next, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWF\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF\">IWF</a>) follows a similar capitalization-weighted process, selecting companies from the Russell 1000 with higher forecasted earnings growth.

Far below are communication services at 17.8% and consumer discretionary at 12.2%. Smaller allocations include healthcare (6.8%) and industrials (5.7%), while financial services stand at a modest 5.0%, offering some cyclical exposure. Meanwhile, sectors such as consumer staples, basic materials, utilities, and real estate each remain below 1.5% of total assets, while energy holds only 0.1%. As a result, FFLG is overweight in technology (+14.2%) and communication services (+7.6%), while maintaining underweight positions in financial services (-8.0%), consumer staples (-3.7%), and energy (-2.8%), reflecting its limited exposure to traditional value areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking down the fund’s positions across the largest sectors, we see that in technology, there are just 11 holdings, despite its large stance in the sector. Semiconductors make up nearly half of the sector, with shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. Software exposure includes Microsoft, Oracle, and Cadence, offering exposure to enterprise systems and chip design. Beyond that, Apple remains one of the fund’s largest positions as well, while smaller allocations in AppLovin, Nutanix, and Coherent add diversification to the fund in areas like app monetization, cloud infrastructure, and photonics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In communication services, FFLG owns a few companies, with large positions in Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund also holds positions in Roblox, a platform for interactive gaming and virtual creation, and Netflix, the well-known streaming provider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positions in consumer discretionary, on the other hand, are more diversified, spread across 13 holdings. Digital retail is a core segment, with positions in Amazon, Carvana, and Wayfair. Traditional retail plays a role as well, with Lowe’s and TJX providing exposure to home improvement and value-focused apparel, respectively. The fund also owns Tesla, representing the auto segment, and Starbucks, the global coffee retailer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside the FFLG’s three largest sectors, it still maintains exposure to a wide range of industries that add diversification to the fund. The most significant allocations include Howmet Aerospace, Axon Enterprise, and FTAI Aviation in aerospace and defense; Mastercard and Affirm in consumer finance; and several healthcare names, such as Boston Scientific, Eli Lilly, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Other minor positions include Apollo Global Management and Coinbase in capital markets, and GE Vernova in industrial conglomerates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"471\" height=\"434\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s large allocation to technology is in line with its typical growth peers like VUG, IWF, and SCHG, which also keep nearly half of the total assets in the sector. On the flip side, other more fundamentals-driven peers such as TMFC and FDG have a nearly 40% exposure to technology, which remains overweight compared to the Russell 1000’s 34.5% allocation. In turn, similar to FFLG, those fundamentally driven funds (FBCG, TMFC, and FDG) also have heavier positions in communication services in the 16% to 18% range, given the strong profitability and growth prospects of names like Meta Platforms and Alphabet. However, FFLG is underweight in sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, reflecting more outsized positions of specific funds like FDG (19.7% in consumer discretionary) and TMFC (15.0% in financial services), rather than the whole peer group’s upbeat consensus in these sectors. As a result, there is a very strong sector correlation among the whole peer group. FFLG’s correlation with most peers is 0.99, while it remains as high as 0.96 with TMFC and FDG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"887\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"301\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation In Line With The Peer Group Average</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a 30.5x P/E, FFLG trades at a large 36% premium to the Russell 1000’s 22.4x. This is largely driven by the fund’s overweight allocation to technology, since the sector’s average valuation is close to 36x P/E. But it is not the only reason. FFLG’s stock picking across sectors such as industrials, financial services, and healthcare also plays a role, as core holdings in these sectors, including Howmet Aerospace, Boston Scientific, and Mastercard, to name a few, all trade above 30x P/E.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund delivers on growth. Its historical earnings growth (22.2%) handily surpasses the Russell 1000 (7.4%), while its sales growth (11.1%) is also above the benchmark (7.4%). Earnings growth in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors is particularly higher than the benchmark, contributing to the fund's growth measures. However, the key factor remains its overweight exposure to these above-average growth areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, profitability indicators are more mixed. FFLG’s EBITDA margin (38.1%) is 2.1 percentage points higher than the Russell 1000 (36.0%), again due to its exposure to technology, as core holdings exhibit strong margins, such as NVIDIA (59.5%) and Microsoft (55.6%). Overweight positions in Meta Platforms (EBITDA margin 52.7%) and Mastercard (62.1%) help as well. On the other hand, FFLG’s ROE of 54.0% remains high, but lags the Russell 1000’s 59.2%, mainly due to negative ROE in holdings within healthcare (Alnylam: -5.0%), and communication (Roblox: -21.2%), which end up affecting the fund’s composite ROE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and ETFs’ websites, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"448\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and ETFs’ websites, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG trades in the middle of the peers’ valuation range. Funds like VUG and IWF exhibit slightly higher valuations, driven by a larger exposure to technology. FDG’s valuation is the highest in the group, reflecting also higher allocation to consumer discretionary, while TMFC is the only one trading below 30x P/E, given its more measured stance in technology and consumer discretionary, along with an outsized allocation to financial services, a value sector by nature. Still, all funds trade well above the Russell 1000, which makes sense due to their much higher average earnings (22.8%) and sales growth (12.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"828\" data-height=\"241\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outperforming The Russell 1000, But Lagging Most Peers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its inception in 2021, FFLG already has a track record of three years. During this period, it has delivered an uneven performance, with a steep decline in 2022, one of the worst among peers, offset by a strong rebound in 2023, the only year it has surpassed the peer group average. This is reflected in its 3-year annualized returns of 31.6%, the second worst among peers. Still, this is more than enough to make FFLG outperform broader equity indexes, such as the Russell 1000, which delivered 22.2% in the same time window.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s volatility has been relatively high, with a 3-year beta of 1.26, which is high even for a growth fund standard, where the beta’s average is 1.15. This positions FFLG as the second-highest beta, only below FBCG (1.29). The fund’s capture ratio both to upside and downside at around 130 also highlights its historical tendency to amplify the broader market price action by a wide margin. For comparison, peers with a more conservative volatility profile (VUG, IWF, SCHG, and TMFC) have remained below 120.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"853\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s average daily volume of $1.23 million is light compared to heavyweights like VUG, IWF, and SCHG, which trade hundreds of millions a day. Of course, FFLG’s bid-ask spread of 0.06% is wider than these very liquid funds, but remains in line with peers FBCG and TMFC. Its turnover of 52% is one of the highest in the group and is somewhat inconsistent with the fund’s claim of keeping a long-term investment perspective. This leads to an expense ratio of 0.38%, higher than market-cap-weighted funds (VUG, IWF, and SCHG), but still below other actively managed peers (FCG, TMFC, and FDG). The fund offers a low dividend yield of 0.19%, way below the broader market average of nearly 1%, though in line with peers, as all funds are below 0.5%. The fund tracking error, in the range of 8% to 9%, is above the average, while its Sharpe ratio of 1.33 (3-year) is the lowest among peers, along with FDG, as other peers have managed to deliver higher returns with more contained volatility. It is worth noting that FFLG’s Sharpe Ratio is still in line with the Russell 1000’s 1.32 (3-year), as a combination of the index’s arguably strong gains and moderate volatility (beta of 1.02).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"776\" data-height=\"376\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG’s playbook is clear: a high-conviction fund with a portfolio that relies on mega caps to deliver growth. Its strong tilt toward technology is a consensus across growth funds, but it goes a step further through an overweight allocation to communication services. This sector mix and stock selection leave the fund trading at a premium to broad equity indexes, though in line with most peers, while a concentrated portfolio helps explain its above-average volatility. That said, there is no question that the fund has an aggressive profile. However, expectations for further interest rate cuts and generally positive Q3 earnings remain a positive setup for growth-oriented funds.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, FFLG is among the options to ride the expected continued strength in large-cap growth stocks. But, as we know, with stock market valuations at current levels and the likelihood of softer growth ahead, we should also acknowledge the risks of pullbacks along the way. And here is where FFLG seems not to be the best answer right now. Its high beta profile signals greater downside risk in a market that may see a bumpy ride going forward. Thus, I take a neutral view on this fund, as other growth peers are expected to offer a more balanced risk-reward ratio in this environment.</p>",

This view was confirmed yesterday as Meta reported a large increase in its revenues and free cash flow. I like that the social media company is extremely profitable and therefore in a good position to absorb higher CapEx spending. Shares of Meta are also attractively valued relative to other big tech companies, and I see rebound potential in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Meta's Q3’25 earnings impacted by one-off tax impacts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The social media company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510678-meta-gaap-eps-of-1_05-misses-by-5_66-revenue-of-51_24b-beats-by-1_83b\">missed</a> consensus EPS expectations on Wednesday, leading to selling pressure for Meta's shares in the after-hours market: the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.05 per-share which fell short of the average EPS prediction by $5.66. The top line however came in at $51.2B, out-matching the average prediction by $1.8B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite strong operational results for Q3’25, Meta recorded a non-cash $15.9B tax charge related to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This tax charge is non-recurring and will therefore not impact Meta’s financial results in the future. Because of this non-recurring tax impact, Meta saw a 83% Y/Y drop-off in its net income to $2.7B.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Despite earnings drop, Meta sees strong core advertising performance</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The social media giant recorded $51.2B in total revenue in the third-quarter, showing 26% year-over-year growth, mainly due to a continually strong performance in the digital advertising market. Meta generated $50.1B in revenue (98% of total) in Q3'25 from its core advertising services (+26%). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1831\" data-height=\"874\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta Platforms\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53926820-17617936613320694_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Meta Platforms</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This growth was boosted by two factors: 1) The digital advertising market is still very much in great shape, with marketers being willing to spend money on online ads, and 2) Ad prices are growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, average online ad prices for Meta’s social media platforms grew at double-digits (+10%) year-over-year in the third-quarter and the important U.S./Canada market achieved a 2 PP growth acceleration in the third-quarter. With Q4 being a holiday quarter that typically sees a spike in Christmas-related spending, I believe that Meta will be able to grow its ad prices in the fourth-quarter as well, including in the crucial domestic market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"694\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53926820-17618047239136145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Meta </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of free cash flow, Meta continued to impress with strong results in the September quarter: the social media platform generated $10.6B in free cash flow in Q3’25, showing a decline rate of 31.5% year-over-year… mainly due to escalating CapEx spending to boost Meta’s superintelligence business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta’s free cash flow margin -- which is a major measure of platform profitability -- expanded 2.7 PP quarter-over-quarter to 20.7% in Q3, so despite an increase in CapEx spending, the social media giant remained widely profitable.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>in mil $</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Q3'24</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Q4'24</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Q1'25</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Q2'25</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Q3'25</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Y/Y Growth</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenues</p></td> <td><p>$40,589</p></td> <td><p>$48,385</p></td> <td><p>$42,314</p></td> <td><p>$47,516</p></td> <td><p>$51,242</p></td> <td><p>26.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>$24,724</p></td> <td><p>$27,988</p></td> <td><p>$24,026</p></td> <td><p>$25,561</p></td> <td><p>$29,999</p></td> <td><p>21.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Purchases of Property/Equipment</p></td> <td><p>($8,258)</p></td> <td><p>($14,425)</p></td> <td><p>($12,941)</p></td> <td><p>($16,538)</p></td> <td><p>($18,829)</p></td> <td><p>128.0%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Payments on Finance Leases</p></td> <td><p>($944)</p></td> <td><p>($411)</p></td> <td><p>($751)</p></td> <td><p>($474)</p></td> <td><p>($545)</p></td> <td><p>-42.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Free Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>$15,522</p></td> <td><p>$13,152</p></td> <td><p>$10,334</p></td> <td><p>$8,549</p></td> <td><p>$10,625</p></td> <td><p>-31.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Free Cash Flow Margin</p></td> <td><p>38.2%</p></td> <td><p>27.2%</p></td> <td><p>24.4%</p></td> <td><p>18.0%</p></td> <td><p>20.7%</p></td> <td><p>-45.8%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Author</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AI-driven increase in CapEx guidance</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta guided for $70-72B in CapEx spending in the current fiscal year which marks an increase of $4.0B at the low-end of guidance compared to the previous outlook.

However, as I have shown above, Meta still generates a ton of \"excess\" free cash flow (the cash flow remaining after CapEx needs have been met) that is available for other investments and stock buybacks. In Q3'25, Meta spent $3.3B on Class A stock buybacks which calculates to a free cash flow percentage of ~31%. More stock buybacks going forward, potential acquisitions of AI start-ups to support Meta's strategic investment in its own superintelligence business, and a strong advertising segment performance in Q4 could all be near term catalysts for a share price rebound.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Meta’s valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most appealing elements of Meta is that the company is extremely free cash flow-profitable <em>and</em> still trading at a very affordable P/E ratio of 25.0X. In fact, Meta is the cheapest big tech stock in the industry group and now even cheaper than Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) which translates to a strong value proposition: the industry group average price-to-earnings ratio, based off of FY 2026 earnings, is currently 28.2X with Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) being the most expensive company in the big tech group with a forward P/E ratio of 30.3X. This implies that Meta trades at an 11% discount to the industry group P/E ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Meta, in my opinion, could easily trade at ~35.0X forward earnings considering how profitable the social media platform is and that it continues to display favorable KPIs trends in its core advertising business (rising average ad prices).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 35X P/E ratio, applied to a FY 2026 consensus EPS estimate of $30.08, implies a fair value in the neighborhood of $1,053/share, implying 49% upside revaluation potential. With Meta now being the cheapest big tech investment that investors can make, on an earnings basis, Wednesday's after-market price drop could be seen as an attractive buying opportunity for growth investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_3e54e3a9cf4906f53a2b5a2f4011a173.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with Meta</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The social media company is going on an aggressive CapEx spending spree in order to cement its leading position in the AI race. Meta is spending billions of dollars on attracting AI talent and building Data Centers in order to cash in on the AI boom. Therefore, a misallocation of CapEx dollars and a lack of adequate investment returns on its AI spending pose risks for investors. What would change my mind about Meta is if the digital advertising market were to see a reduction in ad spending levels, leading to a drop-off in platform profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta grew its top line very fast (+26% Y/Y) in the third-quarter and all of the firm's growth comes from digital advertising. Advertisers continue to spend a ton of money on online ads, and as the largest social media platforms in the U.S., Meta is in a great position to benefit from strong demand for advertising services in the fourth-quarter.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Meta are currently valued at only 25.0X forward earnings, which makes the tech enterprise a steal in the big tech industry group, especially when considering that the social media platform is growing its revenues at double-digits and that the $15.9B Q3 tax charge is only going to be a one-time event. With Meta set to benefit from Christmas-driven advertising spending in Q4 and an earnings rebound on the horizon, I believe investors should be buying the drop.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a></span>). In the article, I rated the stock as a “Hold” but in my conclusion, I was rather cautious<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and leaned more towards a bearish point of view:</span></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>It is very difficult to answer the question if Broadcom is fairly valued right now and if the stock is a buying opportunity. Considering the high risk of a recession and the high probability of semiconductor sales (including AI sales) declining combined with Broadcom still trading for high valuation multiples, I would be very cautious. Broadcom is certainly not a “Buy” in my opinion and a “Hold” at best. But I still see rather high downside risk right now and would not be surprised if the stock is cut in half again.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at the stock performance since then, the stock was not cut in half, but almost doubled. While the S&amp;P 500 increased 25% in value (which is already a great performance), Broadcom increased 92% in value and was the<a href=\"https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;f=idx_sp500&amp;o=-perf26w\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> 8th best performing stock</a> in the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the impressive performance, I will argue once again that Broadcom is a „Hold“ at best. Aside from the revenue concentration and only a few companies being responsible for a huge part of revenue (which might not necessarily be a problem), it is especially the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry making me cautious. Additionally, we should not ignore the risk of AI being a bubble right now and companies suddenly reducing investments in AI-infrastructure. When combining these risks with the high valuation multiples Broadcom is trading for right now, my assessment of Broadcom is rather bearish right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s start by looking at the last quarterly results and Broadcom reported great results once again and<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4492480-broadcom-non-gaap-eps-of-1_69-beats-by-0_03-revenue-of-15_95b-beats-by-130m\"> beat on revenue as well as earnings per share.</a>. And not only did Broadcom beat expectations, but net revenue also increased from $13,072 million in Q3/24 to $15,952 million in Q3/25 – resulting in 22.0% year-over-year top line growth. While revenue already grew at a high pace, operating income increased 55.4% year-over-year from $3,788 million in the same quarter last year to $5,887 million in this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1568\" data-height=\"1444\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom is reporting third quarter results for fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"589\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730329639916_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom 10-Q (Q3/25)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And finally, the company switched from a diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the same quarter last year to a diluted net income per share of $0.85 in this quarter. And non-GAAP earnings per share increased from $1.24 in Q3/24 to $1.69 in Q3/25 – resulting in 36.3% year-over-year growth. Free cash flow increased 46.6% year-over-year from $4,791 million in Q3/24 to $7,024 million in Q3/25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 1: Cyclical Business</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first risk, we should not ignore is that Broadcom is a rather cyclical business. Right now, we see high growth rates for semiconductors, but we should not make the mistake to assume these growth rates are lasting forever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_89557a6d860acaa53986a39f2be9cd57.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at quarterly revenue growth rates for Broadcom in the last almost 20 years we see huge fluctuations between extremely high growth rates and extremely low growth rates. Hence, we should not make the mistake to extrapolate current growth rates into the future and assume 20%, 30% or 40% growth for revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_8e475255d8054961b2b60112d6619091.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we see a similar picture for return on invested capital. On average, return on invested capital was 12.63% in the last 10 years but we see huge fluctuations between a negative return of 7% in 2016 and 31% in 2018. In the last two years, return on invested capital also fluctuated heavily – in 2023 it was 24%, in 2024 it was 8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will come back to growth assumptions for Broadcom in the years to come. At this point, our statement of Broadcom (and the semiconductor industry) being cyclical is enough and we should not make the mistake to suddenly assume high and highly consistent growth rates now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 2: Revenue Concentration</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its last Annual Report, Broadcom stated once again that a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of the company’s net revenue. In fiscal 2024, management is estimating that aggregate sales to the top five end customers (through all different channels) account for 40% of total revenue (after accounting for 35% of sales in 2023). Management is also estimating that a significant customer concentration in the years to come will remain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Broadcom is not disclosing which five customers are accounting for such a huge portion of revenue, it is mostly considered to be Apple Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Alphabet Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and one large distributor, which is selling a huge amount of products from Broadcom. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In case of B2B businesses, a concentration on only a few customers is not unusual. However, the risk remains that a single customer can lead to a steep revenue decline and therefore has a huge impact on the overall performance of the business. Being responsible for a huge part of overall revenue is also leading to pricing power for these customers and as Broadcom investors, we don’t want a customer to have pricing power over Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, Broadcom added another major customer to its list as the company and OpenAI signed a contract.<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> In a press release</a>, OpenAI states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>OpenAI and Broadcom today announced a collaboration for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators. OpenAI will design the accelerators and systems, which will be developed and deployed in partnership with Broadcom. (…) OpenAI and Broadcom have long-standing agreements on the co-development and supply of the AI accelerators. The two companies have signed a term sheet to deploy racks incorporating the AI accelerators and Broadcom networking solutions.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And although it is not clear whether Broadcom will actually generate $10 billion in sales from this deal (it seems likely that $10 billion is the project value and not the revenue Broadcom will generate), we are talking about 17% of Broadcom’s annual revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, it is a multi-year deal for Broadcom and therefore might add maybe $2 billion in annual revenue. I don’t want to downplay this deal as it is a huge win for Broadcom, but company needs to grow at a high pace in order to be fairly valued and this deal alone might add about 3% annual growth for the next few years, which is just a fraction of the necessary growth rate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk 3: High Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third and biggest risks that remains is the high valuation multiples Broadcom is trading for. And since my last article, the valuation multiples got even higher. Right now, Broadcom is trading for 86.4 times earnings, and this is clearly above the long-term average of 47.06. Additionally, the stock is now trading for a P/FCF ratio of 65.6, which is clearly above the long-term average of 22.99 and much higher than in my last article in April 2025 (P/FCF ratio was 35.5 back then).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d429437680cbe9cdae2047b58008d6ff.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead of just looking at simple valuation multiples, we will calculate an intrinsic value for the stock by using a discount cash flow calculation once again. As always, let’s calculate with a 10% discount rate and the last reported number of diluted shares outstanding (4,860 million). As basis for our calculation, we use the free cash flow of the last four quarters ($24,930 million) and in order to be fairly valued, Broadcom must grow 20% annually for the next ten years followed by a 6% growth rate till perpetuity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_d55e7edeacd8b2a37d1d48bd4829f466.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are already high growth rates and only a few companies are able to achieve such high growth rates over long timeframes. However, we could also make the argument that using a discount rate of 10% might not be enough in case of Broadcom. When calculating a WACC by using the last reported numbers for debt, equity, cost of debt and tax rate and using the 10-year treasury yield as risk free rate and adding a 6% market risk premium, we get a number close to 18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fairly valued in this scenario, Broadcom has to grow 44% annually for the next ten years followed by 6% growth till perpetuity. While I would see an annual growth of 44% for ten years in a row being out of reach, we should also not forget that this calculation is implying an 18% annual return for investors over the long run (which would be great and a number only a handful of investors are able to constantly achieve).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Growth Estimates</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s stick with our first calculation and ask whether a growth rate of 20% annually is realistic for Broadcom. Now we can come back to OpenAI’s $10 billion project. Even with that amount spent in only 12 months, it would not be enough to lead to 20% growth. I don’t claim that 20% annual growth is impossible for Broadcom and in the last ten years, the company grew its earnings per share with a CAGR of 28.66%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management is also optimistic in its short-term guidance and for the upcoming quarter. During the last earnings call CFO Kirsten Spears made the following statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $17.4 billion, up 24% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $10.7 billion, up 30% year-on-year. Within this, we expect Q4 AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion, up 66% year-on-year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up 15% year-on-year.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">She also pointed out that margins might be a little lower in the upcoming quarter due to an unfavorable product mix and lower margin products growing with a higher pace. However, this is probably still resulting in about 20% growth for the bottom line. Broadcom does not really offer a mid-or-long-term guidance (at least no specific figures), but analysts are offering growth expectations for the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1388\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom: Consensus EPS Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/47657197-17616730299607525_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Broadcom: Consensus EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/earnings/estimates\">Analysts are quite optimistic</a> for the next few years and between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2029, earnings per share are expected to grow with a CAGR of 34.6% and therefore more than enough to justify the growth rates in the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When talking about high, double-digit growth rates, the biggest part of growth usually must come from top line growth as in most cases neither share buybacks nor margin improvement can contribute with such a high pace. For share buybacks to lead to more than 10% annual growth (assuming a company does not take on additional debt for share buybacks) a stock must always at a single digit price-free-cash flow ratio. And margin improvement contributing at least 10% annually to growth will lead quickly to margins close to 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, we should not ignore that improving margins are also contributing to bottom line growth. And over the last 20 years, Broadcom is reporting constantly improving margins. Although we see fluctuations (especially for the operating margin, the gross margin is more stable), margins are moving higher over the long run, which is a good sign for the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_88daa80d884e69a9d808956d15505139.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we should also look at the number of diluted shares outstanding.

From a German point of view, energy prices are still extremely low in the United States, but people might get more and more annoyed about rising energy prices, which could lead to a discussion whether AI companies must pay for these costs somehow and this might have an impact on future investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I see it as a possibility that Broadcom will grow with a pace of 20% or more in the next ten years, I am rather on the side of caution and would not bet on these growth rates to keep up for such a long timeframe. After all, Broadcom is a cyclical business (see section above).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Broadcom is too expensive to be a good investment. Of course, I must admit that the stock was a great investment in the last five years, and I was clearly too pessimistic.
