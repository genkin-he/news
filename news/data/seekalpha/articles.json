After a modest beat-and-raise quarter in Q3, Tenable sunk slightly lower, accentuating the stock's merits as a value investment.

Since then, Tenable's continued downward drip has made the stock increasingly more attractive, especially as growth has stabilized around the ~10% range. No, Tenable isn't the most exciting growth stock in the market, but at the same time, its exposure management and cyber vulnerability tools are highly applicable to all industries and unlikely to be terribly disrupted by AI, giving Tenable a long runway to expand its sizable TAM. I remain at a \"Buy\"<strong> </strong>rating here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder for investors who are newer to Tenable, here is what I consider to be the long-term bull case for the company:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Tenable has an attractive horizontal software product.<strong> </strong>Its exposure management platform differentiates it from the larger cybersecurity vendors in its category. Its technology is applicable to both small and large firms across industries.</li> <li>Large $50 billion TAM.<strong> </strong>Tenable recently updated its long-term TAM estimates to be $50 billion, with an expected ~20% growth CAGR through FY27. This indicates that the company is only ~2% penetrated into its overall market.</li> <li>Recurring revenue built on top of high gross margins. Tenable has GAAP gross margins in the high 70%s. On top of its pure recurring revenue base, the company has plenty of room to drive economies of scale as it continues to land and retain large clients.</li> <li>Growth and profitability balance. Though Tenable falls just short of the Rule of 40, the company's combination of ~10% top-line growth plus a low 20s pro forma operating margin gives the company a very healthy growth/profitability profile.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, the biggest reason to buy Tenable is its cheap price. At current share prices near $30, Tenable trades at a market cap of $3.58 billion. After we net off the $383.5 million of cash and $354.8 million of debt on Tenable’s latest balance sheet, the company’s resulting enterprise value is $3.55 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Tenable slightly boosted the low end of its full-year billings guidance, while increasing its revenue outlook to $988-$992 million, or 10% growth ($981-$987 million previously). It’s also expecting a healthy 21.5% pro forma operating margin, ~20 bps higher than its previous forecast.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1810\" data-height=\"948\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tenable outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540422610705_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Tenable outlook <span>(Tenable Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And for next year, FY26, Wall Street is expecting the company to hit $1.07 billion in revenue (+8% y/y) and $1.77 in pro forma EPS (+14% y/y). This positions Tenable’s valuation multiples at:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>3.6x EV/FY25 revenue and 3.3x EV/FY26 revenue</li> <li>19.3x FY25 P/E and 16.9x FY26 P/E</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are ultralow, bargain-basement valuation multiples for a growing software company with a defendable moat. We note as well that while it's not the only plausible path to take gains on this investment, the cybersecurity industry has been a hotbed for consolidation recently, with <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-announces-agreement-to-acquire-cyberark--the-identity-security-leader\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-announces-agreement-to-acquire-cyberark--the-identity-security-leader\" target=\"_blank\">Palo Alto Networks recently buying CyberArk</a>. This could lay the foundation for larger cybersecurity firms to snap up more niche point-solutions like Tenable eventually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take advantage of the market's indifference to Tenable as an opportunity to buy into this stock at a great price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 download</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now go through Tenable's latest quarterly results in greater detail.

Revenue growth largely kept pace with 12% y/y growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What investors may have pressed on was the fact that Tenable's billings, which clocked in at $267.5 million (+8% y/y), remained below revenue growth and at the same y/y growth pace as in Q2, which is a forward-looking indicator of Tenable's eventual deceleration from double-digit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two reasons to not be overly pessimistic on single-digit billings growth, however. The first is that Street expectations are already low for this stock, which explains the steep share price decline all year. As previously mentioned, Wall Street is only expecting 8% revenue growth for FY26, which is in line with billings, so any \"weakness\" perceived in this number is already priced into the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second potential upside driver: we have to recall that the \"current billings\" that Tenable reports represent the short-term deferred revenue backlog that will be recognized in a 12-month timeframe. When we stack up longer-term RPOs (remaining performance obligations), however, the story looks better. As shown below, Tenable's long-term RPOs grew 45% y/y to $259.8 million.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1906\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tenable RPO trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33427965-17618540946503372_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Tenable RPO trends <span>(Tenable Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This indicates that Tenable is signing larger, multi-year deals. As more of this RPO moves into short-term billings, we may see further support to keep Tenable's growth rates from decelerating too much. Tenable's increasing trend toward longer contract durations, on top of its existing trend of net revenue expansion as customers increase their spending on the Tenable platform, are all long-term stabilizers for the company's growth trajectory.

Rates on the deposit facility, main refinancing operations, and the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> marginal lending facility remain at 2.00%, 2.15%, and 2.40%, respectively.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With economic activity continuing to grow, ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the central bank is in a very good place and will remain attentive to any emerging risks to ensure it stays there.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent economic developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth: Despite weakness in manufacturing, which remains pressured by trade uncertainty and a stronger euro, slightly stronger than expected growth was driven by a resilient services sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer fundamentals also remain supportive, with real incomes rising, unemployment near historic lows, and solid household balance sheets, suggesting there’s room for increased spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the EU-U.S. trade deal over the summer, the ceasefire in the Middle East, and Thursday’s announcement of progress in the U.S.-China trade negotiations, have lessened downside risks to growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation: While inflation remained relatively firm in September, hovering just above the ECB’s 2% target, Lagarde expressed confidence in the path of inflation, citing that its outlook is broadly unchanged. Still, symmetrical risks to inflation remain, with supply chain disruptions, stronger consumer demand, or climate-related supply shocks having the potential to push prices higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Policy outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With resilient economic activity and monetary policy transmission remaining effective, Lagarde noted that the ECB is successfully navigating the broad range of uncertainties to its outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, with positive developments in the trade and geopolitical environment, the risk backdrop has tilted more positively. Fiscal policy should also continue to play an important role, with defense and infrastructure spending, particularly in Germany, helping to support the broader outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, with risks still on the horizon, the ECB continued to reiterate its data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, remaining committed to keeping policy properly calibrated. That said, while further easing is unlikely for now, the ECB hasn’t closed the door on rate cuts should conditions deteriorate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/macro-views/october-ecb-meeting-steady-rates-good-place\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

The team optimistically views duration exposure in countries such as Hungary, India, and Malaysia, where disinflation trends and proactive central banks create scope for easing. Currency exposure is concentrated in markets with improving external balances, including the Philippines and Malaysia, while we remain cautious toward economies facing election-driven fiscal risk or overvalued exchange rates, such as Romania and Poland.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Hungary:</strong> Our overweight in duration was concentrated largely in the green bond. Real rates are attractive, in our opinion, and although they are now closer to the terminal rate, the central bank has been one of the most progressive in the region. A renewed European focus on meeting excessive deficit targets may help moderate the size of the fiscal deficit in the coming period despite the wider acceptance that Europe needs to raise defense spending. As we get close to next year’s election, an increased focus will be placed on who the market expects to win.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>India:</strong> We are overweight Indian duration as we expect India’s services exports, remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI), and portfolio flows to support India’s balance of payments. Low inflation should enable the central bank to maintain favorable liquidity conditions throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Philippines:</strong> We are overweight the Philippine peso, as lower oil prices this year are likely to improve the country’s terms of trade. Remittance growth has been strong, and lower inflation has allowed the central bank to lower policy rates to support economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Chile:</strong> In Chile, we have maintained our underweight to the local curve in favor of higher-yielding regional peers. While Chile underperformed the benchmark over the past quarter, we expect peso performance to improve on higher copper prices as global supply shocks drive the market higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Malaysia:</strong> In Malaysia, we remain overweight on the ringgit. Economic growth remains resilient, supported by private consumption. Fiscal consolidation efforts are ongoing. The currency outperformed last year but remains inexpensive on a trade-weighted basis. We are overweight Malaysia's duration as inflation is benign, and the central bank has room to ease policy rates should trade uncertainty spill over to dampen Malaysia’s economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Romania:</strong> In Romania, we hold an underweight position in the leu, as we have concerns about the twin deficits, particularly during an election cycle. We are awaiting a rerun of the presidential election this year, and the coalition has not delivered on a strong fiscal consolidation plan. The currency is also overvalued, in our opinion, and contributes to a lack of competitiveness in the region and a large current account deficit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Poland:</strong> In Poland, we are underweight the zloty on valuations and expectations of some reversal of the strength we saw in 2024. At the same time, we are underweight rates on the back of a less supportive political outlook for fiscal consolidation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Israel:</strong> The Israeli shekel has been strong in recent months in spite of elevated geopolitical risks; however, we believe there is likely to be less appetite for a significantly stronger shekel from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Thailand </strong>We are underweight Thailand duration because valuations are unappealing. Rate cuts are already priced in, but financial stability concerns may lead to fewer central bank cuts than are currently priced in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China:</strong> We are underweight the Chinese renminbi on uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and trade measures imposed on China. While the central bank has fixed the currency to lower volatility, the renminbi has weakened on a trade-weighted basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>High-Beta Bucket</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In higher-beta markets, positioning reflects a balance between attractive carry opportunities and sensitivity to shifting policy and political dynamics. We remain constructive on Brazil, where high real rates and credible policy settings continue to attract inflows, and maintain exposure to local bonds in Colombia and Mexico as inflation expectations stay anchored. In Turkey, disciplined monetary tightening has reinforced confidence in the reform trajectory despite persistent volatility, while in South Africa, we have adopted a more neutral stance following an oversold period in local rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Brazil:</strong> In Brazil, local assets have continued to outperform. With nominal policy rates peaking at 15% and with one-year-ahead consensus inflation edging down to 4.3%, Brazil has the second-highest real interest rate in the benchmark index after Turkey, which has supported portfolio flows into the country. Growth is also holding up well this year, while expectations for 2026 have slipped in recent months. Lower U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) rates should give the central bank more scope to cut next year, which should help anchor expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Colombia:</strong> We closed our overweight to the Colombian peso with valuations appearing stretched given a challenging macro backdrop. We have further increased exposure to local bonds, however, as the curve is steep and inflation expectations remain well anchored.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mexico:</strong> Mexico outperformed the benchmark index over the quarter in both FX and rates, but we are growing increasingly concerned about deterioration in the growth outlook driven by the manufacturing sector and private consumption generally, with remittances from the U.S. falling. However, rate cuts, well-anchored inflation expectations, and slowing growth should support bonds in the coming months. We also hold an overweight position in Pemex bonds as the government increases direct support for the company, which should lead to narrower spreads to the sovereign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Turkey:</strong> In Turkey, although political volatility has increased, the economic reform path remains intact, allowing for strong performance in many economic indicators, such as current account and FX reserve levels. We believe investors continue to be overcompensated by high yields, which we believe will not be fully eroded by currency depreciation. Investors may also take a closer look at local bonds, as the central bank raised rates in an emergency meeting to help fight currency flight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>South Africa:</strong> In South Africa, we moved to a more neutral position in rates as the sell-off related to the budget delay was overdone, in our opinion. Now that the budget has been passed, we expect a flattening of the curve, with the long end best positioned to benefit from the rally on relative valuation; however, the scope for further compression is limited by the recent strong performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Frontier Bucket</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In frontier markets, positioning remains guided by improving macro fundamentals and attractive real yields. We continue to optimistically view markets where reform momentum and external balances support currency stability—most notably Uganda and Sri Lanka—while maintaining exposure to Zambia, where disinflation and credible monetary policy create scope for further curve compression. In contrast, we remain cautious on commodity-dependent economies such as Mongolia, where weaker export prices and fiscal pressures may weigh on performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uganda:</strong> We remain constructive on Uganda local currency assets, and the relatively mature local currency market allows us to express this view in longer-dated bonds. We hold a long bond position on attractive real rates. We removed our partial hedge of the currency risk, as we became more comfortable with the fundamental support to the exchange rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> In Sri Lanka, strong remittances and resumption of FDI balance out U.S. dollar demand from the central bank to rebuild foreign exchange (FX) reserves and narrowing the current account surplus on increasing import needs. The combination of the above supports a stable outlook for the rupee, which offers attractive carry return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Zambia:</strong> We maintain our long position in Zambian bonds given the scope for further disinflation in 2025 to support the performance. While the central bank is likely to remain hawkish in light of short-term risks from, among other things, the global backdrop, we see potential scope for the local currency yield curve to bull steepen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nigeria:</strong> In Nigeria, the disinflation process appears to be firmly in place, and we believe the authorities have done a good job in improving the potential for economic stability. Transparency in the local FX market has improved, and there remains a strong capital flow of international money into the local Nigerian market to support the appreciation trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mongolia:</strong> In Mongolia, we hold an underweight position in the Mongolian tugrik, as lower coal prices are likely to impact the country’s commodity export proceeds this year. Mongolia relies on commodity exports, and declining commodity prices should exert pressure on the country’s fiscal and external balances. Despite government and central bank efforts to stabilize the currency, the tugrik may still need further depreciation due to its rich valuation and the anticipated weaker terms of trade this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://active.williamblair.com/emerging-markets-debt/lewis-jones/local-markets-shine-in-a-solid-quarter-for-em-debt/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

October is typically the month when companies adjust<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> prices. A 0.6% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted, increase suggests businesses are raising final prices in response to input price hikes. Prices increased for both goods (0.9%) and services (0.4%), with notable gains in labour-intensive sectors like transport, communication, and entertainment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bank of Japan views this as evidence that sustainable wage growth is driving prices higher. Meanwhile, food prices rose, but at a slower pace. Utilities prices jumped as government subsidies ended. We expect core CPI to remain around 2.5% by the end of this year, backed by solid wage growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Takaichi government plans to fight inflation by reducing the gasoline tax and offering temporary discounts on winter power and gas bills. This may lower headline inflation early next year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"844\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"677\" data-height=\"164\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Industrial production (%MoM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial output rebounded stronger than expected 2.2% MoM sa in September, for the first time in three months</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial production decreased by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, primarily due to reductions in output related to US tariffs. Transportation equipment and iron/steel output declined in September, likely due to the lingering effects of US tariffs. Still, the recent easing of tariff tensions in several countries should support Japan's production rebound in the coming months. Semiconductor equipment sales rose for a second consecutive month, suggesting that strong global chip demand continued. Meanwhile, retail sales rebounded 0.3% MoM in September but missed the market consensus of 0.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both IP and retail sales fell in Q3, indicating a GDP contraction for 3Q25.

Take, for example, the consistently increasing margins of WSO for the last many years. This speaks volumes about the quality of WSO’s business and its industry positioning. No doubt things will remain good for WSO for quite some time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But WSO’s current valuations leave little room for investors to benefit from this great business, especially after considering near-term external industry-related demand headwinds that WSO currently faces, which were evident in WSO's recent quarterly results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the recent fall in the stock price of WSO has made it cheaper, I am still not convinced with the valuation that the company commands despite its superior business. On top of this, the near-term headwind also provides a reason to not own this stock at the current point and valuation and to wait for a better entry. Therefore, I am reiterating my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789844-watsco-reiterating-hold-rating-on-accounts-of-hefty-valuations\">previous</a> hold (neutral) rating on the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Weaker topline marred by external headwinds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this week, WSO reported its third quarter 2025 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510155-watsco-gaap-eps-of-3_98-misses-by-0_31-revenue-of-2_07b-misses-by-70m\">results</a>, which were quite disappointing. The company missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, reporting revenue of $2.07 billion, missing the estimates by $70 million, while GAAP EPS remained at $3.98, which also missed by a wide margin of $0.31.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">WSO has had back to back two disappointing results. The 2Q 2025 results were quite bad, primarily due to an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806320-watsco-inc-wso-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">uneven</a> heating pattern where recooling days appeared during the peak heat period (May-June) of the year. While the management also mentioned macroeconomic headwinds from weaker consumer sentiments as another driver of the weak results, this headwind was largely overlooked by many given the large impact of the weather-related headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the third quarter too, WSO witnessed macroeconomic headwinds from weaker consumer sentiment. In fact, the severity of this headwind is much more intense now than it was in the second quarter. The University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index has consistently been trending lower since the start of the year, with a brief uptick prior to the 2Q25 earnings announcement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1484\" data-height=\"910\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"University of Michigan Consumer Setiment Index\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>University of Michigan Consumer <span></span></span>Sentiment<span> Index</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The weak consumer confidence is further exacerbated by the repeated price hikes taken by the HVAC OEMs over the last couple of years, with the latest <a href=\"https://gopaschal.com/resources/2025-hvac-price-increases/\" rel=\"nofollow\">one</a> of mid- to high single digits announced prior to this year. Combining the repeated price hikes and weak consumer sentiment, the consumer has shown a broad trend of trading down to the base models rather than going with a more premium option.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the weak residential construction demand has also proved to be a considerable headwind for the company. While the size of new construction's contribution to overall revenue (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822361-watsco-inc-wso-presents-at-morgan-stanleys-13th-annual-laguna-conference-transcript\">15-20%</a>) is not as significant as replacement demand, the significant drop in residential demand took a toll on overall revenue growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward the outlook for industry demand looks grim; I expect the external environment to remain somewhat challenging with consumer sentiment still depressed. Furthermore, demand from residential construction is also expected to remain <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/economic-forecasts/housing\" rel=\"noopener\">weak</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability a bright spot</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the revenue growth was not up to the mark, WSO's continues to report good margins, with gross margins improving ~150 bps YoY to 27.5%. The improvements were primarily due to the carryover price hike benefit from the price increases made by OEM in spring this year, as old inventory purchased before the price hikes was sold during the quarter. Going forward, I believe this benefit should fade away from next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one should take note of the gradual improvement that the company has made in its margins over the last many years. The gross as well as operating profit margins have expanded considerably over the last 4-5 years when inflation and price hikes were intense. This shows WSO’s pricing power against a highly fragmented consumer base and cost efficiency against smaller peers (WSO is the largest HVAC distributor in a highly fragmented industry).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1284\" data-height=\"890\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WSO's Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"444\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, in the near term I do not expect any meaningful change in gross margins. For the medium to long term, WSO is set to continue its last 4-5 years' trend of gradual gross margin improvement. WSO’s management has set an ambitious <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806320-watsco-inc-wso-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">target</a> of achieving a gross margin of over 30% from the current floor gross margin of 27% under the “Dream Plan 2”.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 30% gross margin seems quite achievable, as some of WSO’s units already operate at gross margins above 30%, so replicating that across the business should be possible. Furthermore, technology such as Pricefx as well as a higher share of non-equipment segment (30-40% gross margin), should also benefit the margins going forward. Pricefx is a proprietary technology developed by WSO to manage dynamic pricing with specified floor and ceiling prices across the company, serving 100K contractors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As per management, they have been using this technology for the last 2-3 years, and they are “still younger in that journey.” This implies that there is more to come with respect to harnessing the benefit of dynamic pricing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better Cash flow to aid growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The transition from 410A products to A2L products had been quite a stress on WSO’s balance sheet, as the company had to stock both older 410A products as well as A2L products at the same time. This led much of the capital to tie up with the increased inventory investment. Now, as the transition has been largely complete, the inventory turnover has started to improve from the 3Q 2025.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Quarter</p></td> <td><p>Revenue (USD millions)</p></td> <td><p>Inventory (USD millions)</p></td> <td><p>Inventory turnover ratio (not annualized)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sep 2025</p></td> <td><p>2,067.00</p></td> <td><p>1,601.78</p></td> <td><p>1.29</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Jun 2025</p></td> <td><p>2,062.40</p></td> <td><p>1,952.80</p></td> <td><p>1.06</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mar 2025</p></td> <td><p>1,531.10</p></td> <td><p>1,776.10</p></td> <td><p>0.86</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dec 2024</p></td> <td><p>1,754.00</p></td> <td><p>1,385.40</p></td> <td><p>1.27</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sep 2024</p></td> <td><p>2,160.00</p></td> <td><p>1,596.80</p></td> <td><p>1.35</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Jun 2024</p></td> <td><p>2,139.30</p></td> <td><p>1,573.50</p></td> <td><p>1.36</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mar 2024</p></td> <td><p>1,565.00</p></td> <td><p>1,655.60</p></td> <td><p>0.95</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dec 2023</p></td> <td><p>1,603.20</p></td> <td><p>1,347.30</p></td> <td><p>1.19</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sep 2023</p></td> <td><p>2,126.80</p></td> <td><p>1,549.70</p></td> <td><p>1.37</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Jun 2023</p></td> <td><p>2,003.10</p></td> <td><p>1,689.30</p></td> <td><p>1.19</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mar 2023</p></td> <td><p>1,550.60</p></td> <td><p>1,614.30</p></td> <td><p>0.96</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dec 2022</p></td> <td><p>1,581.20</p></td> <td><p>1,370.20</p></td> <td><p>1.15</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Author, Seeking Alpha</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has freed up the excess cash tied up with the inventory, which has made WSO’s balance sheet even healthier. Now, given management's stance of favoring inorganic expansion over share repurchases, I believe one could assume a few M&amp;As going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I usually like share repurchases over any M&amp;As, in the case of WSO, I believe M&amp;A is a better choice for better shareholder returns. First, I believe WSO is currently overvalued, and share repurchases done at expensive valuations often lead to value destruction rather than creation. And second, WSO works in a highly fragmented HVAC distribution industry; being the largest player, WSO enjoys an economy of scale like no other competitor enjoys. This makes WSO a good platform company for bolt-on acquisitions of smaller competitors, which not only increase WSO’s scale and pricing power but also make the newly acquired company more efficient, benefiting WSO in the form of synergies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last rated WSO a hold, particularly due to its expensive valuations, and since then the stock has corrected considerably. However, even now the stock is trading at ~27.8x forward non-GAAP PE ratio, which seems to be quite expensive when compared to the historical range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even when compared to peers, WSO appears to be quite expensive. While WSO has a lower non-GAAP forward PE ratio than the peer average, its growth rate is quite lower than the peer average. Even more so, WSO has the lowest growth rate among its peers. While I do believe WSO has superior business fundamentals, the valuation gap, when viewed in conjunction with growth potential, offers little upside from here.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Company Name</p></td> <td><p>Ticker</p></td> <td><p>Fwd PE ratio</p></td> <td><p>Average growth FY25-FY27</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Watsco, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WSO\" title=\"Watsco, Inc.\">WSO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>27.5</p></td> <td><p>5.87%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Peer Average</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>30.31</p></td> <td><p>18.62%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>QXO, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QXO\" title=\"QXO, Inc.\">QXO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>49.97</p></td> <td><p>65.77%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>WESCO International, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WCC\" title=\"WESCO International, Inc.\">WCC</a>)</p></td> <td><p>15.80</p></td> <td><p>14.66%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Core &amp; Main, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNM\" title=\"Core &amp; Main, Inc.\">CNM</a>)</p></td> <td><p>38.58</p></td> <td><p>11.77%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Applied Industrial Technologies</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIT\" title=\"Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.\">AIT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>23.88</p></td> <td><p>7.88%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Trane Technologies plc</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TT\" title=\"Trane Technologies plc\">TT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>32.93</p></td> <td><p>14.07%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Lennox International Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LII\" title=\"Lennox International Inc.\">LII</a>)</p></td> <td><p>27.99</p></td> <td><p>6.23%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Carrier Global Corp</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CARR\" title=\"Carrier Global Corporation\">CARR</a>)</p></td> <td><p>23.01</p></td> <td><p>9.94%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Author, Seeking Alpha</em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, the near-term industry headwinds make me even more skeptical about its near-term potential as an investment.

Until then, I reiterate the hold (neutral) rating on the stock.</p>",

Additionally, inflation came in hotter, bringing the 10-year inflation swap a tick closer to the 2% target again. We acknowledge that the upside potential for euro rates remains limited this year, and we target a 10-year rate of some 10 basis points above the current 2.65%. With growth on track to improve further in 2026, that’s when we aim for the 10Y to look at 3% as the new equilibrium.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the front end, the wiggle room is much more limited as the ECB’s mantra of being “in a good place” is set on repeat. That means that the 2Y swap rate is firmly anchored between 2.1% and 2.2%. The rise in longer-dated yields must therefore come from steeper curves. That steepening faces resistance from the US, however, where 10Y UST yields dove from 4.5% to 4.0% over the past months. As 10-year US rates stabilise, or even rise as we predict, the 2s10s of the euro curve should feel more comfortable steepening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dutch pension reforms too complex to push for steeper 10s30s by itself</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides US spillovers, we have flattening pressures from the very long end to deal with, whereby the 10s30s steepener seems to have come to a halt. The 10s30s dynamics this year have been almost entirely dictated by the US, but Dutch pension reforms may also play a role. While we still anticipate significant unwinds of 30Y futures and bonds starting in January, we feel the trade may have become too crowded over the summer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimating the timing and size of the flows stemming from the pension reforms is extremely complex, if not impossible, given the available data. Each fund of the 30 scheduled to transition on 1 January 2026 has a unique maturity profile and hedging strategy. Additionally, we remain concerned that IT problems could result in last-minute delays. And now that the US macro landscape is less supportive of 10s30s steepeners, we understand that the trade has become less attractive from a risk-reward perspective.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">US Treasuries continue to trade heavily post-FOMC</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the dust settles following Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee outcome, the new levels for the 2-year and 10-year combo are 3.6% and 4.1%, respectively (both up 10 basis points). The net feeling centers on a Fed Chair that has no problem leaving the funds rate unchanged at the December meeting if that is deemed the thing to do. It comes with residual comfort in the economy. The fact that a 4.3% unemployment rate was specifically referenced as \"low\" amplifies this point. Instead, there is a degree of discomfort with inflation running at 3% and likely heading higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, there has not been a material change in the ultimate landing level for the funds rate. It's now slightly above 3%, but still within the 3% range. And the 5yr rate continues to trade below the straight line that can be drawn between the 2yr and 10yr rates in a steady fashion. This signals an unwavering expectation that the Fed is, in fact, far from done — it's just a matter of timing. The question now is how robust (or not) the economy manages to be in the next month or so<strong>. </strong>Yields may continue to push higher—particularly for longer maturities—despite the current pause. However, the lack of hard data remains a challenge due to the ongoing government shutdown. It is an opportunity for the 10yr yield to have a go at testing higher. It might not go too far, but there is a data vacuum that can be filled in, at least until we gain more clarity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Friday's events and market views</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We start with eurozone inflation numbers. The headline French CPI number is expected to come in at just 0.9% year-on-year, a tick below the 1.1% from September. Italian inflation is also expected to nudge lower, from 1.8% YoY to 1.6%. This would then help the eurozone aggregate core CPI down from 2.4% YoY to 2.3%.

And it’s precisely in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828722-yld-a-step-ahead-of-traditional-high-yield-etfs\">this niche</a> that TCW<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Flexible Income ETF (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLXR\" title=\"TCW Flexible Income ETF\">FLXR</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) seems to have found room to stand out. Not by chance, the fund was originally launched as a mutual fund (MetWest Flexible Income Fund), like many other active ETFs I</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824632-cgms-one-step-above-hy-one-step-below-in-risk\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">’ve analyzed</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, and later chose to switch its structure to an ETF on June 24, 2024. A choice highly appreciated by the market, as shown by the rapid increase in AUM to $2.06B.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in practical terms, what sets it apart? In one word: in my opinion, “dynamism.” In a highly segmented market like income investing, actively managed ETFs can shape asset allocation according to their market view, achieving a better Sharpe ratio (higher returns, lower volatility). Need to know more? Here’s a detailed view on FLXR.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is it?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FLXR is an active <a href=\"https://www.tcw.com/Products/ETFs/FLXR?sc_lang=it\" rel=\"nofollow\">multi-sector fixed income</a> ETF, with the primary objective of generating high current income and a secondary one of maintaining long-term capital appreciation. The fund achieves this through active management, with an expense ratio of 0.40%, a 30-day average spread of 0.05%, and a high turnover ratio reported by SA of 181%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"951\" data-height=\"334\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - Profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - Profile <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is the point of reference for the management and the index used in the comparison metrics.

The reason? The management is opportunistic. If I could describe it in one word, after reading <a href=\"https://www.tcw.com/-/media/Downloads/com/Products/ETFs/Commentary/FLXR-Performance-Commentary.PDF?rev=a0649fceec534310b1b67932a832ef2c&amp;hash=32DA5E6269E76D6DD438AA5639791DFC\" rel=\"nofollow\">TCW’s market comments</a>, I would define it as “counter-cyclical.” In the sense that the opportunistic approach lies in entering the market gradually when the opportunity arises. Seen this way, the underweight in HY and corporate components, and the overweight in short-duration and securitized assets, is justified by the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830794-paaa-defensive-yield-in-uncertain-times\">bear steepening</a> process of the yield curve and the expectation of more favorable spreads. But note, not by chance, during the panic sell in April, when spreads widened, TCW increased FLXR’s exposure to HY (even if only as a minor tactical adjustment). And that’s exactly what one looks for in active management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"757\" data-height=\"261\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - Chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A personal opinion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gives FLXR some interesting characteristics from a portfolio integration perspective.

An element that, note well, does not depend on a higher yield. Rather a greater exposure to a segment that has managed to stand out and suffer less from the weight of the steepening: the MBS. And I think this is the biggest difference among this category of ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This however leads me to also look towards other MBS-centric solutions. And I select two funds that I have analyzed in the past: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805120-jmtg-the-new-but-dated-solution-on-mbs-that-you-need-to-know\">JMTG</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807681-smbs-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-passive-mbs-etf\">SMBS</a>. The presence of other markets inside FLXR gives it higher yield, while the YTD comparison with SMBS is equal in total return. It will be curious to see if FLXR will be able to maintain alpha, considering that it still has a higher expense ratio than these hybrid or passive solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"942\" data-height=\"605\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - JMTG - SMBS: profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"411\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - JMTG - SMBS: profile <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I look directly at the MBS, ABS and CMBS segment which today represent on average between 35% and 45% of the portfolio (as well as the main driver of extra yield compared to the Agg).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1301\" data-height=\"294\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - holding breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"145\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - holding breakdown <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Curious how these assets are only and exclusively associated with something risky after the 2008 crisis, while here the message that comes through is MBS as a defensive pillar and yield driver. Someone might raise an eyebrow… And it is a topic I have talked about in detail also in other coverages (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821859-jbbb-clo-etf-yield-that-sparks-debate-today\">read here</a>), yet I find myself quite in line also in this case with the management. Of course the risk is clear: in case of systemic shocks, these less liquid assets <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828036-cloz-and-the-real-risk-of-bbb-tranches\">suddenly widen the spreads</a>, leading to marked differences between NAV and fair value. And personally, I have some concerns regarding the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834161-bizd-the-great-income-etf-and-a-hidden-paradox\"> private credit</a> segment (although more directed towards the apparent calm in the CLO market, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834161-bizd-the-great-income-etf-and-a-hidden-paradox\">read here</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But net of this, at least in theory, if a credit shock arrives, not systemic in nature like the 2008 crisis, FLXR could have smaller drawdowns compared to funds more loaded with traditional IG/HY corporate precisely because it uses this event opportunistically, as happened in April 2025 (even if it was not a real shock).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was pleasantly involved by the analysis of FLXR. From the study of TCW’s view, through the opportunistic strategy, up to the analysis of the holding distribution, this ETF has carried me into a positive narrative. Of course, active management does not mean certainty of returns, and in shock contexts the credit market suffers a bit in all segments, and if you follow me, you will surely know what my recent concerns are regarding the private credit segment. But as of today, compared to the peers, it has at least demonstrated greater resilience. For this reason, net of the risks of the sector, I think that for FLXR the BUY rating is justified.</p>",

Still, I argued that in the long term, I see Visa delivering better results due to several key differences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, things have developed as I thought, but it hasn't been too meaningful to affect results.

Every time one of them comes up with a novel offering, the other immediately finds a way to offer the same thing. Recently, we saw this with <a href=\"https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html\" target=\"_blank\">agentic commerce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mastercard.com/mt/en/news-and-trends/stories/2025/mastercard-stablecoin-utility-and-scale.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.mastercard.com/mt/en/news-and-trends/stories/2025/mastercard-stablecoin-utility-and-scale.html\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, where do they actually differ?

This would be the narrowest gap in a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, considering their CY26 multiples, Mastercard's premium of 15% is about in line with the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">historical average</a>, but it's not supported by the same growth gap, as we discussed.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its own, Mastercard trades at the high end of its historical valuation range, ahead of what's going to be a lower growth period (though still strong at low double digits).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my mind, considering all of the above, Mastercard trades at a fair valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mastercard remains one of the best companies I know of, and I believe that investors who hold it for the long term will benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I think that in Q3, we saw the growth lead over Visa at its lowest level, and I estimate the closing of the gap will continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This time, it will take center stage and be much more obvious for investors, as it will come down to actual results rather than future estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I can't recommend buying Mastercard here, at a sizeable premium, when Visa is a better prospect in my view. Therefore, I downgrade Mastercard to \"Hold.\"</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important clarification: I wouldn't sell Mastercard shares and replace them with Visa if there are meaningful capital gains involved.

This step raised the pro-forma net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3.7×, which worried the market.

This means the partners who built Marcum and its relationships now hold a meaningful equity interest in CBIZ, and their long-term incentives are tied to the merger's success, reducing the departure of talent and clients after the acquisition, which is a crucial detail often overlooked by the market, and significantly reduces the risks of the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2866\" data-height=\"200\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1\" width=\"640\" height=\"45\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2798\" data-height=\"120\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1\" width=\"640\" height=\"27\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBIZ is built for the middle market, focusing on medium-sized companies. Marcum deal doubles CBIZ's dominance in this stable and profitable market, which is the backbone of growth and employment in the U.S. economy. This segment tends to be more resilient in economic fluctuations. Besides, these types of companies are mostly too big for local small accounting firms, yet too small for large firms such as the Big Four. Thus, they don't receive much attention from either side, opening the way for CBIZ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, about 72% of company revenues come from recurring services that provide a stable and predictable base, such as tax compliance and payroll services, which are essential regardless of the state of the economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1752\" data-height=\"972\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"(CBIZ) Third Quarter 2025 Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-17618501751932616_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">(CBIZ) Third Quarter 2025 Investor Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, CBIZ's employee benefits and insurance sectors were always strong and stable, but their main challenge was finding new clients; Marcum's deal opened a vast market of tens of thousands of clients who joined CBIZ.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBIZ Inc. achieved strong performance in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835042-cbiz-inc-cbz-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835042-cbiz-inc-cbz-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">third quarter</a>, where revenues increased by 58.1% to $693.8 million, driven by the financial services sector, with revenues increasing by 80% to $579 million, and the Marcum merger.

However, the impact of financing the acquisition was clear, as the Net Income declined to $30.1 million due to higher interest expenses of $28 million driven by higher debt levels incurred to fund the cash portion of the acquisition, demonstrating the short-term pressures that fear market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It seems that CBIZ is keen to transform the Marcum deal into added value for shareholders through stock buybacks and improving margins, despite integration costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full year, the company reaffirmed its guidance for total revenues of $2.8 billion and $2.95 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.60 - 3.65, reflecting a significant increase in profitability from the first year as a result of the deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1680\" data-height=\"956\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"(CBIZ) Third Quarter 2025 Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59349569-1761850271068273_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">(CBIZ) Third Quarter 2025 Investor Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key consideration is the seasonality of accounting and tax work, which peaks in the first and second quarters. CBIZ revenues from the insurance and benefits sector were stable, mitigating the intensity of seasonality. Following the acquisition deal, which doubles the size of the financial services sector, the combined profits are expected to be more seasonal, with a higher concentration in the first half of the year. Therefore, any investor who does not consider this point might worry about the results of the second half quarters, although this is merely a natural rhythm depending on the company's nature.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the company's <a href=\"https://ir.cbiz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cbiz-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-month-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.cbiz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cbiz-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-month-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">guidance</a>, it expects adjusted EBITDA of $450 million for 2025.

As a result, they may focus on resolving daily integration issues rather than addressing key business objectives and staying abreast of new developments in AI and other areas.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Marcum's deal introduced CBIZ to a short-term uncertainty, as the market priced in the failure risks but did not consider the success reward. Considering the recent strong performance, low valuation compared to peers, and the company's repurchase of approximately 800,000 shares, which confirms the cheap stock price, it would be fair to give a \"Buy\" rating. However, investors should monitor debt repayment progress each quarter, as this is an essential event that will significantly reduce risks and lead to higher multiples.</p>",
