(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\" title=\"DocuSign, Inc.\">DOCU</a></span>) experienced a major boom during the pandemic, unsurprisingly. However, as the world returned to normalcy, the stock has essentially erased all those gains. Early this year, I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756902-docusign-stock-dont-sign-me-up\">initiated the stock</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> at a sell rating, citing weak fundamentals and overvaluation. Since that article, DocuSign has plunged ~23%, so my bearish view has played out. The company reported earnings back in September but won't report again until December, and I believe this is a good time to take another look at their results.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the below analysis, few signs of a turnaround are found. Top line growth remains sluggish, and billings guidance was uninspiring. Profitability also seems to be under pressure as both gross and operating margins contract, so despite the introduction of AI tools into their solutions, not much is going right for the company at this point. That said, the forward P/E ratio has contracted to a justified level, so I have decided to upgrade DocuSign to a hold rating on the basis of valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"652\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rating History\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Too Many Customers?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"881\" data-height=\"529\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is it possible to have too many users or customers? While it's great that DocuSign has a strong user base, it also raises the question of whether there is still room to grow. As you can see in the <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/408980645/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Q2-26-Docusign-Quarterly-Earnings-Deck.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">company overview above,</a> they are already the number one e-signature solution, and more importantly, 95% of the Fortune 500 are already customers. It's good news that they have been able to attract so many clients, but at the same time, where do they go from here? They're in 180 countries already and have over a billion users, and so while they hold a leadership position in their space, I believe investors should consider that a good part of the potential market has now been accounted for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Innovation To Drive Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1419\" data-height=\"715\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAM\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"322\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617646496591415_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It does seem that management is also seeing the growth challenges ahead, so they are focusing on innovation in order to drive future growth. Above is a timeline of the company's evolution, and as you can see, from 2024 onwards, they have transitioned into an era of \"Intelligent Agreement Management.\" They have added new solutions to their portfolio and have adopted AI to create tools like AI-assisted review and AI extractions. Through the creation of these new tools, DocuSign will be able to offer more services to customers, and that in turn should help them to drive top-line growth.

While that is still a satisfactory growth rate, as you can see above, revenue growth has been very sluggish since late calendar 2023. There is some rebound in growth from the previous quarter, but overall, it may be too early to conclude that an inflection point is in. Still, they were able to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">beat analysts' expectations</a> by $20.05 million, so results are better than feared. Looking at their subscription revenues specifically, there has also been recent sluggishness with growth at just 9% as well. Therefore, there hasn't been enough acceleration to show that growth is truly headed in the right direction. Their billings do show some better signs, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1082\" data-height=\"677\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Billings\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While revenues aren't showing many signs of improving business activity, the company's billings show that the worst may be over.

Also note that the rolling four-quarter YoY growth rate has ticked up notably to 9%.

For gross margin there was notable contraction, especially for their core subscription business. For subscriptions, gross margin contracted by 40 basis points, while the company as a whole saw a contraction of 20 basis points. This could indicate that cost control hasn't been great, but it also may show that clients aren't opting for their higher-margin products. That client behavior could be a concern moving forward. The bad news doesn't stop there, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1436\" data-height=\"553\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OpEx\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-1761766615149672_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted operating margin contracted by a rather worrying 240 basis points YoY to 29.8%, and increases in operating expenses are to blame. While I see no problem with the increase in R&amp;D spending as a percentage of revenues, the increases in sales &amp; marketing and general &amp; administrative expenses are clearly undesirable. S&amp;M expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by 80 basis points YoY, while G&amp;A expenses increased 90 basis points to 7.9% of revenues. These are clear signs that corporate efficiency has not been favorable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of contracting margins, DocuSign reported an adjusted EPS of $0.92, representing a decline of 5.15% YoY. A bottom-line decline is, of course, not a great sign. Still, they managed to beat analyst estimates by $0.07, so expectations were very low to begin with. Currently, it seems that DocuSign is dealing with problems on two fronts. Top line growth remains sluggish, and profitability is also not headed in the right direction.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guidance Raised</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1342\" data-height=\"499\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite what I would call lackluster Q2 results, DocuSign was still able to deliver a beat and raise. All of the above FY2026 guidance figures have been <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Financial-Results-Announces-1-0-Billion-Increase-to-Share-Repurchase-Program/\" rel=\"nofollow\">updated favorably,</a> and that is, of course, welcome news for investors. The company is now expecting revenue growth to be at about 7%. That is a slowdown from <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY2025's 8% increase,</a> and so again, the top line isn't showing signs of a re-acceleration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For subscription revenues in particular, the projected 8% increase would be unchanged from FY2025, so at least for their core business, things are shaping up to be steady. That's also the case for billings. Their 7% growth projection would also be unchanged from the previous year. However, recall that Billings growth was 13% in Q2. Therefore, the acceleration we saw may not continue for FY2026 as a whole, and that makes the demand outlook shaky once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for their margins, the above ranges for both gross margin and operating margin are below what we saw in FY2025, so the efficiency and profitability woes we discussed above are also happening in the annual timeframe. Overall, while a raising of guidance is surely welcomed, I believe these updated figures still don't provide much promise that the company has hit an inflection point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Likely Fair</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During this year, DocuSign's forward P/E ratio has continued to trend down. At a current reading of 18.76, the multiple is essentially at one year lows. I believe the valuation correctly reflects the fundamentals right now. Today, we have learned quite a bit about the company. Revenues remain sluggish, and while Q2 billings were quite strong, full year guidance for billings shows that demand remains subdued. Profitability is also under pressure, and if they don't improve their corporate efficiency, the bottom line will pay the price. As stated just above, guidance was raised, but the new figures still don't show that a meaningful turnaround is happening. With that being the case, I find the valuation contraction this year to be unsurprising and justified. Currently, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha shows</a> that DocuSign trades at around a 25% discount to the IT sector according to the non-GAAP forward P/E ratio. Given the struggles the company finds itself in, I would say that this valuation gap is an appropriate reflection of reality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign has been under pressure ever since the pandemic was over, and from today's analysis, it seems the company will continue to experience sluggishness moving forward. As stated above, demand doesn't seem to be overly robust right now despite their expanded solutions portfolio. Furthermore, margin contraction is dragging down their profitability. While normally a beat and raise is a great sign, the updated guidance is still rather lackluster in my view. That said, the forward P/E ratio has come down quite a bit from earlier this year, and since the valuation is now justified, I have decided to upgrade to a neutral rating of hold.</p>",

Watch for the licensing clearance for Thermage in Canada, now at the fourth generation of radio frequency technology, to help its performance in the country. Thermage is a nonsurgical treatment technology used to provide skin tightening and smoothing treatments globally. In South Korea, Thermage surpassed the 1,000 unit installed base milestone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solta is poised to grow from here. BHC launched Fraxel FTX in April. The leading skin rejuvenation treatment, performed by dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and other licensed aesthetics professionals in the U.S., is in the early phases. BHC reported double-digit percentage revenue growth in all three regions.

Volume is growing at a balanced pace across all channels. BHC used an AI-powered engine to optimize its call points. That should lead to higher script growth.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guidance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC raised its guidance slightly on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flow. The OCF increased to up to $1.025 billion. This is likely due to a good portion of adjustments in gross-to-net rebates related to its inventory in the channel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"989\" data-height=\"483\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BHC Guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697584750042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bausch Health</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC likely raised its adjusted EBITDA by managing its SG&amp;A spending. Q3 costs were unusually low after the firm changed its accruals for nonrecurring items. Investors should look out for the firm lowering expenses by increasing marketing and operating efficiencies. That might lead to an increase in next year’s guidance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xifaxan is the first of BHC’s growth catalysts. The firm must continue its investments to support Xifaxan and Cabtreo growth. The aesthetics business is the second growth catalyst for its global revenue. BHC is making long-term investments in research and development to support the innovation pipeline. Thermage FCX in Canada and Fraxel FTX in the U.S. are the products that come to mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Innovation in hepatology is BHC’s third growth catalyst. Larsucosterol, from its DURECT acquisition, is undergoing a study for treating alcohol-associated hepatitis. It will start the phase 3 trial by early 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this segment, the RED-C program faces no competition. The market does not have an approved product for the primary prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (“OHE”). The market opportunity is 1.9 million patients in the U.S. BHC has two global Phase 3 studies that it expects will have a readout in early 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock Grades</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC’s momentum grade fell after shares peaked at above $8 in the summer to trade below $6.00 recently. The D+ grade might rise back to a C if its recent rally to $6.61 holds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BHC grades\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"274\" height=\"210\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/71188-17618697593094985.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHC’s valuation is strong, with an ‘A’ grade.

Yet this was eclipsed by<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the value measure of demand, which jumped 44% y/y to a record of US$146bn in Q3.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-to-date demand is 1% higher at 3,717t, equating to US$384bn in value, up 41% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors remained firmly in the driving seat in Q3. Huge ETF buying (+222t), accompanied by a fourth successive quarter of bar and coin demand above 300t (316t) fuelled the rise in overall demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central bank buying remained elevated at 220t, 28% up on the prior quarter, albeit that y-t-d buying of 634t has been at a slower pace than the 724t bought in the first three quarters of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery consumption in Q3 posted a double-digit y/y decline (the sixth in succession) to 371t, as volumes remained under pressure in the record price environment. This contrasts with a 13% y/y increase in value to US$41bn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technology demand was fractionally weaker compared with Q3’24. Support from growing AI demand met with headwinds from US tariff policy and the surging gold price.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Highlights</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The LBMA (PM) gold price hit 13 new all-time highs in the quarter. </strong>The price rose 16% during Q3 and generated an average quarterly price of US$3456.54/oz, up 40% y/y and 5% q/q.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Total gold supply rose 3% y/y to a quarterly record of 1,313t.</strong>Mine production, which typically sees seasonal growth in Q3, was up 2% y/y to 977t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The supply of recycled gold remained elevated but stable at 344t: up 6% y/y, down 1% q/q. </strong>Recycling activity was restrained to some degree by expectations of further price gains and generally supportive economic conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>OTC investment added 55t to Q3 demand. </strong>This measure captures continued widespread global interest from institutions and high net worth individuals, particularly in September.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 1: Investment demand continued to drive

Even if they soften in Q4, we think adjustment to such prices will take time to materialise. Our ‘no growth’ technology estimate remains in place, torn between thrifting and AI investment.</li> <li> <strong>Central banks</strong>: We revise our central bank expectations modestly higher, encouraged by demand resilience in Q3 in the face of rapid price rises. A broadening of demand is another welcome and supportive factor.</li> <li> <strong>Supply</strong>: Ramp ups and high margins continue to incentivise mine production. But outages and revisions might once again disappoint those expecting an annual record. Hedging is expected to be muted.</li> <li> <strong>Recycling </strong>continues to surprise in its lacklustre response.

There is some disagreement about how readily these apply; our view is that the reality is more subtle.<sup>1</sup> A weaker dollar during the first nine months of 2025 is largely pinned on hedging activity. US assets may have lost some of their exceptionalism but they remain core to most global portfolios. Hedging will just put the onus on them working a little harder for investors, and a marginal shift into <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828916-gold-market-commentary-stick-twist-or-double-down\" rel=\"noopener\">less crowded assets</a> is prudent portfolio management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anticipated US policy rate cuts is another key pillar for investors. While the opportunity cost motive remains important, the potential consequences of lower rates add more nuance, potentially reflecting a worsening US economy but also stoking fears of inflation; the by-now familiar theme of stagflation, historically supportive of gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold ETF demand was the standout sector y-t-d. We think the drivers of this demand remain intact even after tonnage holdings eclipsed their 2020 highs. As a share of general portfolios, gold remains under-allocated and a flood of new investors could easily push holdings through the previous peak given the strategic case to do so remains solid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there are tactical risks that could derail further inflows. These include: technical sell signals; a continued easing of tariff tensions; geopolitical resolutions; softening fears of US Fed independence; and a rotation out of gold into ‘cheaper’ assets. Such risks naturally proliferate when prices move this fast and holdings approach previous peaks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some further profit-taking in Q4 would not come as a surprise following the mid-October sell-off, although the selling appears to have been focused outside of the gold ETF market, possibly driven by Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) activity.<sup>2</sup> We remain optimistic on North American and European demand and view the economic and political backdrop as constructive for resumed buying of any dips. Our forecast is raised and our confidence bands narrowed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the FOMO bar and coin trade in full swing – helped along by geopolitical concerns – we maintain our positive full-year estimate. Gold’s rapid price rise has not been a deterrent as it has been on occasion historically. On the contrary, retail activity chasing rising prices should be a boon for the sector, particularly following short-term corrections. This applies broadly across geographies, with China and India seen picking up steam in Q4. Trade tensions and economic pessimism will likely drive Chinese buying, while Indian investors may eschew jewellery in favour of lower margin bar and coin. Anecdotally, softer US bar and coin demand appears to have sharply reversed at the start of Q4.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fabrication</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A glum start to Q3’25 was on the cards for jewellery demand. Although China’s demand in tonnes echoed the lows of the Global Financial Crisis, a q/q pickup and strong spending provided some welcome relief. Any price softness in Q4 will indicate how quickly and confidently consumers adjust to prices. Given how prolonged the slump has been and how strongly prices have risen, the recovery might not be rapid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indian volume demand was also weak but did not plumb crisis-level depths. A likely resilient economy ahead should also give us useful statistics on price adjustment in Q4, absent a sharp move higher or lower in prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other regions mirrored consumption patterns in the two largest purchasing centres, one reason models of global demand tend to be quite straightforward to construct. Jewellery responds quite consistently across geographies to price, lagged price adjustments and changes in income. Given no major expected changes in income on a global level in Q4 (albeit that broad income growth remains supportive longer-term), price movements and consumer adjustment are likely to dictate the sectors final quarter tally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is little to be added to what we have said previously about technology demand. Price pressure is a constant feature for an industry accustomed to thrifting. But at the same time it continues to benefit from the AI boom. This tug of war will likely flatten demand for the year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central banks</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central banks are likely to continue their buying spree. Our full year estimate of between 750-900t – barring any surprises - is lower than last year, but remains – in line with y-t-d flows – surprisingly resilient given strong price rises. Upside and downside risks are balanced, dictated largely by price volatility. However, three factors make us positive on continued demand in Q4 and beyond:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Major EM countries’ FX reserves growth (y/y) is forecast to pick up in Q4</li> <li>Demand has broadened, with hitherto dormant banks becoming active</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795736-central-bank-gold-reserves-survey-2025\" rel=\"noopener\">Our 2025 central bank survey</a> showed the strongest intention to continue buying since it was initiated in 2019.</li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supply</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The theme of production growth from ramp-ups and new projects led by Ghana, Canada and Australia could take production to a new record in FY2025. However, suspension of a few operations makes the prediction a little less certain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong prices will likely continue to incentivise hedging contracts to expire naturally, and this is likely to remain a negligible feature of total mine supply. But while prices are materially higher than the last quarter, the themes remain unchanged. A more significant price drop, unlikely in our view, could encourage some producers to lock in prices. Although, looking back at the largest drawdowns during recent rallies, our data shows no discernible aggregate rise in hedging (Q4 2008: -49t, Q4 2016: -24t and Q4 2023:+21t )</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling continues to undershoot expectations. Distress-selling will likely require a large dent in consumer balance sheets which we have not seen. The selling back we have seen appears opportunistic, and this if often a feature of a healthy rally in its early innings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling is likely to be muted unless store closures escalate, but there is scant evidence of that from China. We do note caution in India, where a material drop in gold prices could induce forced selling to cover loans collateralised with gold jewellery. All in all, a relatively healthy global economy, alongside widespread expectations of higher prices from analysts are likely reticence of people to sell back.<sup>3</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold jewellery volumes plunge, while values soar</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Surging, record-high gold prices in Q3 resulted in a sharp y/y drop in gold jewellery consumption</li> <li>Global demand fell to its weakest for a third quarter since the Covid-hit low of 2020</li> <li>Value measures of demand, in contrast, were almost universally higher, as consumers spent more on jewellery.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Tonnes</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'25</strong></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Y/y % change</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>World total</td> <td>460.0</td> <td>371.3</td> <td>-19</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-down.svg\" alt=\"Gold Demand Trends: Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>India</td> <td>171.6</td> <td>117.7</td> <td>-31</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-down.svg\" alt=\"Gold Demand Trends: Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>China, P.R.: Mainland</td> <td>102.4</td> <td>83.8</td> <td>-18</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-down.svg\" alt=\"Gold Demand Trends: Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 3: Gold price saw another record-breaking quarter</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Daily gold price in key currencies, indexed to 1 January 2025*</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1118\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 3: Gold price saw another record-breaking quarter\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"258\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619083973754284_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, ICE Benchmark Administration, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 jewellery demand fell y/y across all markets, almost without exception. While the two market giants – India and China – each saw a seasonal q/q uplift in demand, the y/y picture was decidedly weak. The record gold price environment was the primary reason for the decline, simply due to affordability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, the value of jewellery consumption – at US$41bn – was 13% higher y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold jewellery consumption is 18% lower y-t-d at 1,095t, although so far remains comfortably above the 2020 low of 894t. The value of gold jewellery bought globally y-t-d has reached US$112bn, a record for our data series and 14% above the US$99bn from 2024.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Headwinds from the high gold price and lacklustre consumer sentiment pushed gold jewellery consumption down to 84t, the weakest Q3 since 2007. This brought y-t-d Chinese gold jewellery consumption to 278t, down by a quarter compared to Q1-Q3 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The q/q comparison, however, shows an uptick in demand, primarily due to seasonal factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the picture looks different when we consider demand in value terms. In Q3, Chinese consumers spent RMB66bn (US$9bn) on gold jewellery – the second highest Q3 spend ever, just short of the Q3’23 record of RMB71bn (US$10bn).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a typically slow July, demand began to recover toward the end of August, supported by Chinese Valentine’s Day gifting.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, a period of relatively stable gold prices in July and August allowed consumers time to adjust to the higher price level. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830948-china-gold-market-update-wholesale-demand-rebounded\" rel=\"noopener\">Wedding-related gold purchases ahead of the early October Golden Week</a> – a popular period for marriages – also boosted demand to some extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conventional and more heavily-designed 24k jewellery suffered the sharpest losses, while lighter-weight pieces were relatively resilient. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830757-2025-chinese-jewellery-retailer-insights-gold-self-wear-remain-key\" rel=\"noopener\">Hard Pure gold items continued to outperform relative to others</a>; greater affordability, as well as innovative designs and the creative use of materials like gems and enamel, helped drive this outperformance. Retailers also increased their efforts to promote items with high premiums and intricate craftsmanship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seasonal patterns suggest further demand pick up in Q4, but demand volumes are likely to stay well below long-term averages as the gold price remains extremely elevated. The surging international gold price disrupted gold jewellery sales during the early October eight-day Golden Week holiday. Moreover, a later-than-usual Chinese New Year’s holiday next year may delay both retailer replenishment and lunar year-end consumer purchase – a traditional peak season for gold.<sup>5</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the bright side, potential further easing of monetary or fiscal policy, as well as the possibility of a stabilising gold price, could offer some support for gold jewellery demand.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 4: Record price pressured gold jewellery demand volumes, but boosted value</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Quarterly gold jewellery consumption, tonnes and value*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1134\" data-height=\"470\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 4: Record price pressured gold jewellery demand volumes, but boosted value\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619084663624969_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: ICE Benchmark Administration, Metals Focus, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">India</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">India had its weakest third quarter for jewellery consumption since 2020, at 118t, reflecting the surging local gold price, which surpassed the Rs117,000/10g level during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The value measure of demand was more resilient. Q3 spending of Rs1,143bn (US$13bn) was on a par <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733071-gold-demand-trends-q3-2024\" rel=\"noopener\">with the very strong quarter of Q3’24</a>, when demand jumped to a nine-year high following a cut in Indian import duties. The value of demand y-t-d has reached a record Rs2,513bn (US$29bn).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The domestic gold price rise was magnified by local currency depreciation during the quarter. This, and a lack of major festivals and weddings, kept a lid on jewellery buying during July and August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand was ignited in September, however; the accelerating price rally triggered consumers to purchase before prices rose further. Anecdotally, the end of Shradh (a 15-day inauspicious period for gold buying) on 21st September saw a rush of demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rising price has not only increased the demand for lighter-weight and lower-carat pieces, but consumers are also increasingly willing to exchange old gold jewellery, rather than buy new gold items outright. Furthermore, there seems to be evidence that demand is shifting away from jewellery towards lower-margin, small investment products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">18k plain jewellery has seen increased acceptance across many parts of the country, at the expense of more traditional 22k. But demand from wealthier consumers has so far held firm, reflected in relatively strong sales of high-value jewellery items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 also saw a continuation of the trend for Indian consumers to use their gold jewellery as collateral for loans. Data suggests that, so far this year, consumers have pledged at least 220t of gold jewellery in this way, helping to keep a lid on the domestic supply of recycled gold.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle East and Turkey</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sharply rising local gold price kept jewellery demand in Turkey under considerable pressure in Q3. Demand of 26t during the first three quarters is on a par with that of 2021 – a year in which the gold price averaged US$1,769.6/oz.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer inflation in Turkey remains very punitive, eroding consumer sentiment and purchasing power alike. Continued domestic and regional geopolitical tensions have also contributed to weakness in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand was similarly weak for virtually all markets across the Middle East, with sharply higher gold prices impacting affordability – and encouraging some selling-back of high-carat jewellery – and regional geopolitics negatively affecting consumer sentiment. Iran was the exception, where a y/y increase in gold jewellery demand was motivated by safe-haven investment buying.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">US and Europe</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery demand in the US extended the downtrend that has been in place since Q2’22. Demand of 25t was the weakest for a third quarter in our data series back to 2000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contrastingly, demand measured in value terms continues to go from strength to strength. US gold jewellery spend grew to US$3bn in Q3 – the ninth consecutive y/y increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling volumes were due to the high and rising gold price, which continued to impact affordability, with consumers shifting to lower-carat, lighter-weight items as well as reducing their frequency of purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets across Europe witnessed universal declines in jewellery volumes, with France seeing the most pronounced contraction. Mirroring the global pattern, demand in value terms was positive, showing that consumers were prepared to spend more on gold jewellery, albeit that this translated to lower volumes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets for which we report data universally witnessed declines in gold jewellery volumes in Q3 as record-high prices squeezed consumer purchasing power. For much of the region, demand in value terms made double-digit y/y gains, in contrast to the notable weakness in tonnage volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indonesia, was the only country to also see a y/y fall in the value of demand. Constrained by surging gold prices and higher costs of living amid challenging economic conditions, consumers continued to shift towards low-carat items.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rest of Asia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A double-digit decline in Japanese jewellery demand resulted in the weakest Q3 on record, at just 3t. Demand for kihei chains (plain chains often bought as a quasi-investment) was healthy and offered some support, with reports suggesting this trend gathered pace in October as the price rally surged and domestic demand exploded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long-term downtrend in South Korean jewellery demand continued in Q3. Consumption was supported in part by the wedding season, and by consumers bringing forward purchases in anticipation of yet higher prices. But nevertheless, the continued trend for lower-carat items eroded volumes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australian gold jewellery demand in Q3 registered its ninth consecutive quarter of y/y decline. The US dollar value of demand was opposingly positive, as the high price supported value but supressed volumes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Table 2: Jewellery demand in selected countries,

stellar gold price rise during Q3 was largely the result of an acceleration in investment demand across all formats – bars, coins and gold ETFs. Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and US dollar weakness continued to fuel safe-haven flows, with added impetus from growing concerns over US Fed independence and the US government shut down. And the surging price, in turn, attracted more investment flows, with investors spurred by FOMO, clamouring to build gold positions and benefit from further gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Y-t-d investment demand has reached 1,566t – just 6% shy of the peak seen in Q1-Q3’20.</strong> In value terms, however, we’re in uncharted territory: investment for the first nine months of the year amounted to US$161bn – well over double that of the same period last year (US$63bn) and 74% above the prior US$92bn record from 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment demand has generated a significant share of total gold demand this year: bar, coin and gold ETF demand has accounted for over half of total demand so far in 2025, up from less than one third last year.<sup>6</sup> This comes at the expense of jewellery, in part as some consumers chose to shift to the more cost-effective investment market to gain gold exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anecdotal reports suggest that there was widespread global interest in gold, particularly in September. The rise in <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-open-interest\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">net long positioning on COMEX</a> during the quarter is indicative of this increased interest, which is captured in the 55t of OTC and stock flows in Q3. It’s worth noting that this figure also reflects any statistical residual from the balance of other demand and supply estimates in our model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment-friendly environment for gold that has persisted throughout the year so far remains in place for now, given still-heightened geopolitical uncertainty, ongoing US dollar weakness and expectations for future US rate cuts. Added to which, richly valued equity markets have not only highlighted gold’s role as a diversifier, but also its role as a hedge against potential equity market corrections. The stage therefore looks set for continued strength in investment flows, a trend that has been observed so far in Q4.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 5: Gold ETFs have had their strongest y-t-d inflows since 2020</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Quarterly ETF demand and assets under management (AUM), by region*</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1124\" data-height=\"463\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 5: Gold ETFs have had their strongest y-t-d inflows since 2020\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"264\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-1761908777928073_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, ICE Benchmark Administration, Company Filings, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETFs</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828631-gold-etf-flows-september-2025\">Q3 was a record quarter for gold-backed ETFs</a>. Global inflows reached US$26bn, eclipsing the previous quarterly record of US$24bn set in Q2 2020. In volume terms, Q3 demand of 222t took total holdings to 3,838t, just 2% shy of the 3,929t peak from November 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand for gold ETFs has been a key contributor to gold’s price performance so far in 2025 and Q3 was no exception, particularly in September as the momentum behind inflows accelerated across all regions. And that also generated a ‘virtuous circle’, as investment flows were further attracted by the continued rise in the gold price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>North American-listed funds added 139t (US$16bn) during the third quarter</strong>, taking total regional holdings to 1,996t (US$246bn in AUM), around 100t shy of the record levels reached in October 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>European-listed funds added 70t</strong>, the strongest quarterly tonnage increase since Q1’22, yielding y-t-d demand of 148t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Meanwhile, demand for gold ETFs listed in Asia remained positive</strong> but slowed markedly in Q3, to 13t. The region has now witnessed eight consecutive quarters of growth, during which holdings have increased by 200t to 334t. India saw the largest growth in Q3 (+11t). Japanese funds attracted 6t of inflows, which offset the 6t of outflows from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Funds listed in other regions barely changed</strong>, as outflows in South Africa balanced out growth in Australia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Y-t-d, gold ETFs have added 619t (US$64bn). North American-listed funds absorbed the bulk of these flows (346t,US$37bn), although there was also sizable demand for ETFs listed in Europe (148t, US$14bn) and Asia (118t, US$12bn). Healthy demand has continued into Q4, with strong October inflows noted at the time of writing, particularly into US- and Asian-listed funds. Nevertheless, historical analysis suggests gold ETFs have still room to grow.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bar and coin</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global investment in gold bars and coins exceeded 300t for a fourth successive quarter – a feat not achieved since 2013.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FOMO was rife, particularly during September as the gold price rally really took off. This added to the already strong safe-haven flows driven by global geopolitical concerns, with further support likely from some jewellery consumers switching to lower-margin pure investment products. With only one or two exceptions, investment markets across the globe made strong y/y gains.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bar and coin demand in Q3 extended the broad upward channel that has been in place since the lockdown lows of H1’22. Although down by a third compared with the strongest Q2 for 12 years, demand was bang in line with its quarterly five-year average and y-t-d – at 313t – is only 23t shy of its full year 2024 total.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment activity was relatively soft during July and August, as the gold price range traded and local equities surged. However, investor appetite was rekindled in September by the rallying gold price and fading equity momentum. And we believe that continued monthly announcements of central bank gold buying further supported investor confidence in gold during Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far in 2025, the key drivers of gold investment have been the unprecedented gold price rally, US-China trade tensions and concerns over the strength of domestic economic growth. With this in mind, we expect gold investment to stay strong as we head towards year-end. Continued flare-ups in US-China the trade conflict should keep safe-haven demand elevated; and the potential for rate cuts to stimulate decelerating economic growth should further support bar and coin investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.gold.org/news-and-events/press-releases/chinas-insurance-funds-inject-new-vitality-global-and-domestic-gold\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inclusion of Chinese insurers in the gold market</a> following regulatory changes earlier this year should provide longer-term support for China’s gold investment demand. Public information available suggests that, as of Q3, six insurers in the pilot program have become Shanghai Gold Exchange’s members, paving the way for their gold allocation. As at the time of writing, however, no fund had disclosed purchases.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">India</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">India saw sustained strong demand for gold bars and coins during Q3 as the rising domestic price attracted investors. A depreciating rupee through much of the quarter meant that the local price of gold continued to strengthen even when the international price was rangebound. This continued upward momentum in the price attracted investors keen not to miss out on the rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Y-t-d demand of 184t is the strongest for a first nine-month period since 2013, and is just shy of the average post-covid full-year demand of 196t.<sup>7</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The value of Q3 investment was exceptional, surpassing US$10bn. This is the highest quarterly value on record by some margin, 56% higher than the previous record of U$7bn from Q4’24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While investment demand was consistently strong throughout the quarter, it accelerated in September, both as the price rally gained momentum and as the festive season drew closer. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some jewellery consumers may have opted for other ways to buy gold, such as bar and coins, which are closer to the local spot price. The surge in buying was reflected in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830950-india-gold-market-update-festive-shine\" rel=\"noopener\">domestic gold price moving to a premium relative to the international price</a>, a trend that has persisted so far into October.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle East and Turkey</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment demand in the Middle East region followed a broadly similar pattern to other markets: relatively subdued in the first two months of the quarter before gathering pace in September as the price rally took off. The first two months of the quarter saw heightened levels of profit-taking as the gold price stabilised close to then-record highs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran was an exception to the regional trend: demand earlier in the quarter was supported by safe-haven buying, which was choked off by the steep and rapid rise in local gold prices, which ultimately proved too financially prohibitive for many investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, in Turkey, investment demand was up from the very low base of Q3’24, but remains well below the heightened levels of the preceding couple of years. The high interest rates paid on lira savings accounts continued to draw investor attention away from gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand was particularly weak during July and August as the rangebound gold price encouraged profit-taking, which was reflected in the local price moving to occasional discounts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand ramped up sharply in September, quickly gathering steam and pushing local premiums up to above $100/oz. Demand has remained strong in the opening weeks of Q4, with premiums remaining very elevated.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The West</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US gold bar and coin market witnessed another sharp decline in net gold investment demand – the only market to see a y/y decline in Q3. Demand sank to 7t – the lowest since the pre-covid 2017-19 trough. The weak Q3 figure, however, masks a very healthy level of two-way activity, as strong buying was met by continued profit taking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand improved in September as gold breached new record highs, which stemmed liquidations as investors began to revise up their price expectations. The clarification in September that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/white-house-tariff-update-gold-bars-welcome-development-lbma-says-2025-09-10/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">gold bars would be tariff-exempt</a> further spurred demand. So far, buying interest has further accelerated in October, which could bode well for a strong net Q4 figure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">European retail investment extended the recovery seen in the first half of the year, driven by persistent geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of the rebound was concentrated in September, as gold prices surged to new record highs, with the rally attracting considerable media attention. This continued into October, particularly with the widely-publicised breach of the US$4,000/oz level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">German-speaking markets witnessed the strongest y/y improvement, although the UK also generated double-digit growth.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 6: Y-t-d bar and coin investment at a 12-year high</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Q1-Q3 global bar and coin investment by country/region, tonnes*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1113\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 6: Y-t-d bar and coin investment at a 12-year high\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619088426299152_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: ICE Benchmark Administration, Metals Focus, Refinitiv GFMS, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets across the ASEAN region saw almost universal double digit y/y growth in gold bar and coin demand in Q3. In line with the global pattern, the surging gold price combined with heightened global geopolitical concerns sparked strong investor interest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thailand saw its strongest quarter since Q1’19, while Indonesian investment reached levels not seen for over 12 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vietnam was again the outlier. Investment was slightly lower y/y, although this was apparently not for lack of demand. Contacts report queues building outside gold stores, but a shortage of gold in the domestic market led to limits being imposed on the number of gold products per customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vietnamese government announced during the quarter that, effective 10 October, it would abolish the State monopoly on gold bar production and imports. This is expected to reduce the premium on domestic gold products.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rest of Asia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan saw modest net buying in Q3. As the price reached new record highs in September, investors rushed to buy gold, but liquidations also remained sizeable throughout the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the end of Q3, as the local price broke up through ¥20,000/g, <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/precious-metals/article-870044\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">demand has exploded,</a> with stores reportedly running out of stocks of small bars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korean investors were similarly attracted by the gold price rally, with domestic prices further fuelled by a depreciating currency. Y-t-d demand in Korea has reached a record high for our data series of 18t.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australia</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gold price rally sparked a y/y jump in Australian gold bar and coin investment in Q3, a trend that has continued into October with some dealers apparently running out of stock and reports of<a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/golds-spectacular-price-rise-continues-as-new-record-high-hit/news-story/57b763892d1e32c0e3dd2a2ccb575ff6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> long queues forming outside bullion retailers.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Modest profit-taking activity was noted in August and July, which dropped in September as price expectations grew

But this dynamic has shifted this year: the prospect of US tariff hikes encouraged a surge in demand during H1 as a pre-emptive move to avoid tariffs, and, as a result, Q3 demand was negatively impacted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Record gold prices continued to exert pressure on the industry, with manufacturers often compelled to identify cost savings. Thrifting and substitution efforts are reportedly accelerating, and this may have a long-term impact for gold demand across many electronics applications.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Electronics</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A flat quarter was dominated by ongoing strength in AI-related demand set against uncertainty in the broader consumer electronics market. </strong>As reported during previous quarters, AI server construction and data centre deployment continues to experience robust growth, while demand for end-user consumer products recorded only a modest recovery, constrained by persistently high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. Research firm Omdia has reported that the five major smartphone manufacturers recorded y/y growth during Q3, but remain cautious as “economic fears and uncertainty continue to weigh on vendors’ strategic planning”.<sup>14</sup> Regionally, while Asian demand strengthened, a slight decline in the US, along with continued weakness in the European manufacturing industry, contributed to the overall global slowdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold used in light emitting diodes (LEDs) fell during Q3. </strong>The sector faced headwinds from a slowdown in mainstream applications, most notably the backlight sector as some manufacturers adopted conservative inventory strategies due to macroeconomic uncertainty. This translated to a small fall in panel manufacturer utilisation for the quarter, a negative trend anticipated to persist for the remainder of 2025 and further depressing the outlook for the backlight segment. The automotive sector’s continued pursuance of advanced lighting and display technologies has accelerated the penetration of mini-LEDs, eroding traditional LED uptake and negatively impacting gold volumes. Finally, growth was reported in some high-value, specialised segments, such as horticultural lighting and UV/IR LED, but this niche market expansion was insufficient to fully offset the decline in high-volume mainstream shipments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The wireless sector returned to modest growth during the quarter as demand for mobile power amplifiers (PA) and Wi-Fi chips strengthened.</strong> Compound semiconductors are of growing importance in this sector;<sup>15</sup> manufacturers are increasingly deploying them to enter high-growth, non-PA segments such as satellites, high-altitude drones, and solar battery management modules. This is likely to support gold demand in the sector going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Demand for gold in the memory sector recorded an increase during Q3</strong>. The primary catalyst for growth was the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. A severe supply crisis in the traditional hard disk drive (HDD) market (which saw lead times increase to over 52 weeks) created a spike in demand for alternative NAND flash solutions, boosting gold usage. While some substitution pressures were reported in the DRAM sector, the ongoing widespread adoption of AI will likely remain the primary driver of growth in the memory sector over the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The printed circuit board (PCB) also registered growth in Q3.</strong> Strong performance was recorded in AI server infrastructure, satellite communications, consumer graphics cards, and PC market applications. AI server demand was the single most significant factor driving growth, propelling gold usage through continuous specification upgrades. The automotive market was the only major PCB segment to decline in Q3, primarily from the negative impact of high US tariffs on imported cars, and the phasing out of electric vehicle subsidies in Europe and the US, which suppressed overall automotive market momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the aggregate level, there was a mixed performance for the four major electronics fabrication hubs in Q3: Japan - 19t (-4%); US - 16t (-2%), Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR - 21t (unchanged); South Korea - 7t (+1%).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other industrial and dentistry</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 saw a 5% decline in gold used in other industrial and decorative applications (primarily in gold plating as well as in gold thread, known as jari, used in traditional Indian clothing).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China’s relatively weak economy, and the continued trend for jewellery store closures, negatively impacted plating demand. In India the record-high local gold price had a mixed impact: higher demand for gold used in plating (as consumers shifted away from more expensive solid gold items) contrasted with a decline in jari.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The record price further eroded gold used in dental applications, which stood at 2t for Q3.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supply</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total supply hit a new third quarter record</h4> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Total gold supply in Q3 gained 3% y/y to reach a quarterly record of 1,313t</li> <li>Mine production – which typically sees seasonal growth in Q3 – was up 2% y/y and 8% q/q at 977t; also a record quarter for our data series</li> <li>The supply of recycled gold remained elevated at 344t, 6% higher y/y but marginally lower q/q despite the US dollar gold price surging 16% during the quarter.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Tonnes</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'25</strong></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Y/y % change</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total supply</strong></td> <td><strong>1,275.9</strong></td> <td><strong>1,313.1</strong></td> <td><strong>3</strong></td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-up.svg\" alt=\"Total supply hit a new third quarter record\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mine production</td> <td>957.6</td> <td>976.6</td> <td>2</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-up.svg\" alt=\"Total supply hit a new third quarter record\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net producer hedging</td> <td>-6.5</td> <td>-8.0</td> <td>-</td> <td>-</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Recycled gold</td> <td>324.8</td> <td>344.4</td> <td>6</td> <td><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/all/themes/gold/images/arrow-up.svg\" alt=\"Total supply hit a new third quarter record\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total supply of gold extended its long-term uptrend; Q3 marked a new record high of 1,313t.

The 47% increase in the US dollar gold price over the first nine months of the year has fuelled elevated levels of opportunistic selling among consumers keen to capitalise on gains.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 9: Y-t-d global mine production edged past the 2018 record</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Annual and y-t-d global mine production by quarter, tonnes*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1120\" data-height=\"440\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 9: Y-t-d global mine production edged past the 2018 record\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619093714794714_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: Metals Focus, Refinitiv GFMS, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mine production</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mine production saw its typical seasonal uptick in Q3, jumping 8% q/q to 977t and surpassing last year’s third quarter record by 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth in output from both Canada and Ghana during the quarter outweighed y/y declines from Mali and Turkey. The following markets registered notable growth – largely from a combination of ramp ups or start-ups:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Canada</strong> (+20% y/y), which saw the ongoing ramp up of Blackwater, Cote and Greenstone mines, as well as new production from B2Gold’s Back River project and higher output from a number of existing operations</li> <li> <strong>Ghana</strong> (+9% y/y), due to the continued ramp up of Shandong Gold’s Namdini operation, as well as first gold being poured at Newmont’s Ahafo North at the end of the quarter</li> <li> <strong>Australia</strong> (+6% y/y), where higher production at Gruyere, KCGM and Telfer outweighed lower output from Cadia, where the PC2-3 panel cave expansion project continues</li> <li> <strong>Russia</strong> (+3% y/y), on the back of higher production from a number of mines, which more than offset a fall in production from some of Polyus’ operations due to waste stripping.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several countries witnessed a y/y fall in gold mine production, due to market- or mine-specific factors:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Indonesia</strong> (-37% y/y), as a fatal incident prompted the suspension of operations at Grasberg in September. Waste stripping also resulted in lower production from Batu Hijau</li> <li> <strong>Mali</strong> (-13% y/y), where Loulo-Gounkoto remained suspended due to the continued dispute between owner Barrick and the Malian government<sup>16</sup> </li> <li> <strong>Mexico</strong> (-5% y/y), with production at Equinox Gold’s Los Filos mine still suspended after the expiry of its land access agreement, and where a pit wall movement led to a temporary suspension of operations at Orla Mining’s Camino Rojo mine</li> <li> <strong>Turkey</strong> (-19% y/y), due to lower operations from several operations including Oksüt and Kisladag.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current rate of growth in mine production suggests a record annual total is within reach for 2025. That said, the continued closure of Grasberg will have a significant impact on production in Indonesia, making an accurate prediction more difficult than usual.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Metals Focus’ mine production data includes estimates for artisanal and small scale gold mining (ASGM). The contribution from this source is expected to grow in 2025, given the strong rise in the gold price while costs remain relatively well contained.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/aisc-gold\" rel=\"noopener\">Average all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the gold mining industry increased 12% y/y in Q2 to US$1,578/oz</a>. The 2% quarterly increase in the AISC is partly explained by seasonal factors, with operations typically resuming at full capacity in the second quarter after scheduled shutdowns in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher sustaining capital expenditure, along with greater input costs and larger royalty payments tied to the higher gold price, further contributed to the y/y rise in the AISC.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net producer hedging</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unsurprisingly, in an environment where the gold price is repeatedly reaching all-time highs, gold mining companies have preferred to remain fully exposed to Q3’s rising spot gold price. Initial estimates suggest an 8t reduction in the global hedge book during the quarter. This follows a revised Q2 decline of 25t, down from the initial -7t estimate. Revisions to this data are commonplace, as Gold Demand Trends is published before many companies release their data. Gold mining companies, typically, are unwinding their hedged positions by letting the contracts expire naturally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our quarterly data series shows consistent de-hedging since Q1’24, during which time the hedge book has fallen by a total of 94t, to around 160t.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycled gold</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 gold recycling increased by 6% y/y to 344t. Given the 40% y/y rise in the average quarterly US$ gold price, the recycling response seems surprisingly muted. And this is put into sharper focus when considering the q/q change (one that is arguably more meaningful for recycling). Recycling volumes in Q3 were 1% down on those seen in the previous quarter, despite a 16% rise in the spot gold price between the end of June and the end of September.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Typically, we would expect recycling to respond positively to such a strong price rise. But the size and speed of the gold price rally this year has, it seems, led to an expectation of yet more price rises. This has encouraged restraint in recycling activity in anticipation of further gains, both due to consumers holding back from liquidating and from Indian consumers increasingly pledging gold jewellery as collateral against loans. Moreover, selling prompted by economic distress remains limited, cushioned by relatively benign macro conditions across many major recycling markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nevertheless, recycling volumes are elevated by historical standards.</strong> Y-t-d, supply from this source has reached 1,041t – the second successive year in which it has exceeded 1,000t. The only other time we have witnessed such persistent strength in recycling was in 2009-2012 during and after the Global Financial Crisis, when a combination of high gold prices and economic distress prompted a surge in activity.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 10: At above 1,000t y-t-d, recycling is elevated, but remains relatively unreactive to the surging price</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Y-t-d recycling supply, tonnes*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1124\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 10: At above 1,000t y-t-d, recycling is elevated, but remains relatively unreactive to the surging price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17619094162230716_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data as of 30 September 2025 <span>(Sources: Metals Focus, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a regional/country level, flows in <strong>Europe</strong> have driven much of the y-t-d growth in global recycling volumes, with Italy, Germany, France and the UK all witnessing double-digit growth. The regional supply of recycled gold in the first nine months of the year is around 40% higher than the average y-t-d volumes over the preceding 10 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling in the <strong>US</strong> has been firming over recent quarters, albeit not to the same extent as in Europe. Instances of distress selling remain rare; instead, the key driver of growth is opportunistic selling to take advantage of the higher gold price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China</strong> was a key driver of the y/y growth in recycling in East Asia, largely due to the higher gold price and retail store closures, which have generated a continued flow of inventory for melt. The q/q comparison was contrastingly weak, as positive price expectations started to kick in and caused people to hold onto their gold in the hope of benefiting from further price gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>India</strong> drove the y/y and q/q decline in South Asia as recycling in this key consumer market remained weak. The rates of exchanging old jewellery for new remain very high, and consumers also continue to pledge their gold jewellery as collateral for loans, capitalising on the high price. Both trends have resulted in lower volumes of gold being sold outright for scrap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recycling activity across the <strong>Middle East</strong> was universally higher q/q, reflecting the higher gold price and, in some instances, an element of distress selling. On a yearly basis, recycling supply is relatively stable, with gold serving its function as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notes</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revisions to data</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All data is subject to revision in the light of new information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Historical data series</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand and supply data from Q1 2014 are provided by Metals Focus.

Where identifiable, this also includes gold bought and stored via online vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Central banks</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net purchases (i.e. gross purchases less gross sales) by central banks and other official sector institutions, including supra national entities such as the IMF. Swaps and the effects of delta hedging are excluded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comex net long positioning</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publishes a weekly <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Commitment of Traders (COT)</a> report that provides information on the positioning of speculative investors in the U.S. futures markets. The report gives the aggregate positions held by traders from the previous Tuesday, including the number of long contracts (that stand to benefit if prices rise) and short contracts (that benefit if they fall). The report is often used as an indicator of market sentiment regarding the price of gold: short positioning reflects bearish sentiment while long positioning reflects bullish sentiment in the gold futures’ markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer demand</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sum of jewellery consumption and total bar and coin investment occurring within a country i.e. the amount (in fine weight) of gold purchased directly by individuals. Technology demand is not included at the individual country level, as it is measured at the point of fabrication rather than at the point of consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Electronics</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume of gold bullion or grain fabricated into components used in the production of electronics, including – but not limited to – semiconductors and bonding wire.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Dentistry</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume of gold bullion or grain fabricated into products destined for dental applications such as dental alloys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold-backed Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and similar </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume of gold held in physical form by open-ended Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and other products such as close-end funds, and mutual funds. Most funds included in this list are fully backed by physical gold. While several funds allow other holdings such as cash, derivatives or other precious metals, we monitor only those funds investing at least 90% in physical gold and appropriately adjust their reported assets to estimate physical holdings only. For funds that include physical holdings of multiple precious metals, the total AUM depicted for such funds is lower than their actual total AUM.

Measured on a gross basis (i.e. includes recycled gold). Excludes: purchases funded by the trading-in of existing carat gold jewellery (gold-for-gold exchange); and purchases of second-hand jewellery, other metals plated with gold, and coins and bars used as jewellery. At the global level, it is measured as jewellery fabrication adjusted for changes in inventories held by the trade. At the country level, it is jewellery fabrication adjusted for changes in trade stocks plus imports, less exports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Jewellery fabrication</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jewellery fabrication is the first transformation of gold bullion into semi-finished or finished jewellery. This differs from jewellery consumption as it excludes stock building/de-stocking by manufacturers and distributors. At the individual country level, it also excludes imports or exports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Jewellery inventory</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Changes to the level of jewellery stocks along the jewellery distribution chain, this is the difference between gold fabrication and gold consumption. A negative figure represents a draw-down of stocks when consumption exceeds fabrication. A positive figure represents a build-up of stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>LBMA Gold price PM</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unless otherwise specified, gold price values from 20 March 2015 are based on the LBMA Gold price PM administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBA\" title=\"IB Acquisition Corp.\">IBA</a>), with prior values being based on the London PM Fix. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/gold-prices\" rel=\"noopener\">How is Gold Price Determined | Gold Pricing Primer | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Medals/imitation coins</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fabrication of gold coins without a face value, produced by both private and official/national mints. India dominates this category with, on average, around 75% of the total. ‘Medallion’ is the name given to unofficial coins in India. Medals of at least 99% purity are also included.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mine production</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The volume (in fine weight) of gold mined globally. This includes an estimate for gold produced by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASGM\" title=\"Virtus AlphaSimplex Global Macro ETF\">ASGM</a>), which is largely informal. For more information, refer to: <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/mine-production\" rel=\"noopener\">Gold Mining Industry Primer | Information About Gold Mining | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Net producer hedging</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The net impact in the physical market of mining companies’ gold forward sales, loans and options positions. Hedging transactions – which release gold to the market from existing above-ground stocks – accelerates the sale of gold. De-hedging – the process of closing out hedged positions – has the opposite impact and will reduce the amount of gold available to the market in any given quarter. Over time, hedging activity does not generate a net change in the supply of gold. For more information, refer to: <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/mine-production\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gold Mining Industry Primer | Information About Gold Mining | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Official coins</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net investment in gold bullion coins (i.e. gross purchases less gross sales) at the retail level. It is equal to the volume of fine gold in coins fabricated by official/national mints which are, or have been, legal tender in the country of issue. It is measured at the country of consumption rather than at the country of origin (for example, the Perth Mint in Australia, sells most of the coins it produces through its global distribution network). In practice it includes the initial sale of many coins destined ultimately to be considered as numismatic rather than bullion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>OTC and other</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This number captures demand in the OTC market (for which data is not readily available), changes to inventories on commodity exchanges, any unobserved changes in fabrication inventories and any statistical residual. It is the difference between total supply and gold demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Other industrial</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold used in the production of compounds, such as Gold Potassium Cyanide, for electro-plating in industrial applications as well as in the production of gold-plated jewellery and other decorative items such as gold thread. India accounts for the bulk of demand in this category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Over-the-counter (OTC)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions (also referred to as ‘off exchange’ trading) take place directly between two parties, unlike exchange trading which is conducted via an exchange.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Recycled gold</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold recovered from fabricated products, including unused trade stocks, which is refined back into bullion. This specifically refers to gold sold for cash. It does not include gold traded-in for other gold products (for example, by consumers at jewellery stores) or process scrap (scrap generated during manufacturing, which never becomes part of a fabricated product but instead returns as scrap to a refiner). For more information, refer to <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/recycling\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gold Recycling Primer | Gold Recycling Process | Goldhub</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technology</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This captures all gold used in the fabrication of electronics, dental, medical, decorative and other technological applications, with electronics representing the largest component of this category.

This costs them around $1.44 billion, meaning a relatively normal ~80% payout ratio based on this year’s expected Core FFO. Also, something that may go under the radar is that EXR has, as of Q3 2025, the authorization to purchase up to $491.4 million under their buyback program, although they don’t utilize it. This can offer somewhat of a safety net in case the stock falls too much, assuming that the management wants to take advantage of the program.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"733\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Extra Space Storage IR EXR stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277339279094_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>U.S. Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for a general catalyst that's currently unwinding, we have to remember that this type of company ultimately depends a lot on the economy.

In general, many REITs (including those like EXR) could be relatively close in terms of risk-adjusted reward since they depend on similar factors, and they are clearly standing to benefit from cuts. What we now see is basically the opposite of what rate hikes did - when most REITs began to suffer - increasing the theoretical “risk-free” rate to the detriment of this asset class.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1114\" data-height=\"602\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Extra Space Storage IR EXR stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-1761827733998062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Grand View Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, the long-term trends should continue to be in this industry’s favor, with expectations even as high as a <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/self-storage-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">5.9% CAGR globally</a>, with North America continuing to be key in this market with a 5% CAGR in the US. This is ultimately the result of a mix between a growing population, urbanization, and other well-known trends combined with “upgrades” that can improve demand, such as contactless access, better websites, increased marketing spending, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve also seen Trump’s meeting with Xi that apparently went very well and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html?msockid=20185b8529876fee1a664d1028996e46\" rel=\"nofollow\">even resulted in him cutting tariffs imposed on China</a> and reaching a one-year agreement on rare earth supplies, which can alleviate the market’s recently reignited tariff worries. This is important because the market’s sentiment and expectations around tariffs and the economy have clear effects on the price, with a company like EXR depending quite a lot on the economy and the activity of consumers or businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, we’re still looking at what so far is the second-longest US Government shutdown (and still counting) that - on top of the already very elevated political uncertainty - adds even more fear around what the Fed will do. For example, the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-government-shutdown-may-prompt-first-ever-workaround-inflation-protected-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">halted all data collection and publishing during the shutdown</a>, meaning that Powell and the others will have less updated data in a time when the effects of tariffs could’ve been more visible, leading to uncertainty around the Fed’s next interest rate decision, as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Powell pointed out that a December cut is not yet decided</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair, it wouldn’t be impossible to see Powell be extra careful and either delay this cut or the next one as a result, as he’s already been a critic of tariffs and said how they were the cause for the delayed rate cuts earlier this year. Less data around that can lead to even more delays, which would be bad for REITs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1376\" data-height=\"548\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Extra Space Storage IR EXR stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"255\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60669497-17618277338015375_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

I’ll go for a WACC of 7% (above my estimated ~6.6% based on a cost of equity of ~7.4% and ~4.8% cost of debt), with a net debt of $12.79 billion, $878.8 million in OP-related equity, and 221.3 million shares outstanding as of Q3.

It’s a value ETF that owns some of America’s fastest-growing dividend stocks. I also added Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF™\">SCHD</a>) for its yield. While it may have a slower growth profile than CGDV, it brings a lot more stability and lower volatility to the table. Also, it has a much better income profile, which is key for a portfolio with an average target yield of 5.50%. To further improve the income, I added the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVO\" title=\"Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF\">DIVO</a>), which uses a very conservative covered call strategy to juice the income of the portfolio without adding substantial options risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I also added the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JEPQ\" title=\"JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF\">JEPQ</a>), which applies a covered call strategy to technology stocks. Given the elevated valuation of these stocks and increasing competition risks between the \"big guys,\" I believe a covered call strategy makes a lot of sense in this area going forward. Also, because of higher volatility, the options premiums are much higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, I added higher income through the Alerian MLP ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>), which owns midstream Master Limited Partnerships, and the VanEck Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFXF\" title=\"VanEck Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF\">PFXF</a>), which is a bond proxy due to the high correlation between preferred equities and long-term government bonds.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"974\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my prior article, I did not backtest the model portfolio, which was a huge error. <span class=\"highlighted_text\">Using the iShares Select Dividend ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DVY\" title=\"iShares Select Dividend ETF\">DVY</a>) as a benchmark, we see that since December 2022</span>, the model portfolio has returned 16.6% per year, more than 600 basis points above the 10.22% return of the benchmark ETF.

Nonetheless, it’s data that confirms my thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I’ll make good on my promise and show you my picks for the other half of the 50/50 model portfolio. I will show you how we can use single stocks to add value and which companies I would pick. Needless to say, it’s just food for thought. As I explained in my ETF and so many other articles, every investor is different. I just provide the framework that can help people build their own portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let’s get to it!</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Things To Keep In Mind After Laying A Strong Foundation of ETFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to a strong ETF foundation, we can now add value by adding single stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But how do we do that? Buying random dividend stocks can hardly be the solution, as we already have a basket of diversified dividend income and dividend growth stocks in the ETF part of the portfolio. We need to find something special to add value. If we fail to do that, we may as well make this a 70%, 80%, or even 100% ETF portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, needless to say, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>We need to prevent too much overlap. It’s tough, given how much diversification we have, but it’s doable.</li> <li>We need to focus on the qualities we usually incorporate. This includes healthy dividend payout ratios, strong balance sheets, and business models that provide these companies with an edge. I’m not using the words \"wide moat\" here because REITs and some other good income stocks have no moats (capital is often the only constraint in the real estate business), yet they have other advantages that make them good investments.</li> <li>We need a consistently rising income to protect our income against inflation.</li> <li>We need to be aware that adding too many single stocks defeats the purpose of the 50/50 portfolio. We should stick to our highest-conviction ideas. However, we should also avoid adding too few stocks. For example, giving stock XYZ a 20% weighting would make it as important as the entire SCHD ETF in the model portfolio.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I would use various buckets to get a better overview of what we’re looking for and to make sure we maintain prudent diversification. For example, when I wrote about my retirement pyramid strategy, I used the overview below. I used three baskets with very different requirements for income and growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1020\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the pyramid strategy is mainly used on growth and income differences, the situation in this article is a bit more complex, as we don’t sort based on income and yield but on structural differences between stocks and the ETFs the model portfolio already owns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally (you may go into a different direction), I would go with the following buckets:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>I would go with a core of proven dividend compounders. These can be similar to the ones that SCHD owns, with yields of 3-5% and above-inflation dividend growth. Let’s call this the Stability Core.</li> <li>Then, I would go with a group of stocks that do not yet have a great ETF to represent them. These are essential infrastructure and energy stocks for inflation-resistant income and higher income. We can call this Hard Asset Value (or something else, as this is just a placeholder name for simplicity).</li> <li>I would obviously include Income Boosters, which are high-yield stocks that may not always have moats but have strong and safe income to improve the overall income and safety profile of the portfolio.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I would track the Core &amp; Satellite method here, which I discussed in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817645-the-only-retirement-investing-strategy-i-would-trust-with-my-future\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817645-the-only-retirement-investing-strategy-i-would-trust-with-my-future\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>.

Although I am not the biggest fan of the lending business due to low barriers to entry and extreme cyclical risk, I have to say that MAIN is one of the most reliable players.

It has an investment-grade balance sheet and two smaller SBIC funds.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1660\" data-height=\"1246\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616542536951642_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Main Street Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the company has a total yield of roughly 7.3%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1660\" data-height=\"1242\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654278804428_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Main Street Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing I like is the fact that the company is not overweight in software. Many BDCs have been aggressive funders of software operations, which now exposes them to severe AI disruption, as I wrote in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824776-single-biggest-risk-for-bdcs-nobody-is-talking-about\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824776-single-biggest-risk-for-bdcs-nobody-is-talking-about\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. As you can see on page 24 of this investor <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1b8ce2882772fbe3248825d2affa0489/mainstcapital/db/396/10973/pdf/Q2+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1b8ce2882772fbe3248825d2affa0489/mainstcapital/db/396/10973/pdf/Q2+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>, its largest segment is machinery, accounting for 16% of its portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving over to hard asset value, I can keep this super straightforward. Here, I would own the most mission-critical players in infrastructure. This includes energy midstream infrastructure like pipelines and processing assets, large-scale infrastructure like toll roads, ports, power distribution, and even Class I railroads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we exclude MLPs, which we already own in the ETF part of the model portfolio, I would suggest American companies like ONEOK (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE\" title=\"ONEOK, Inc.\">OKE</a>), which has a liquids-focused pipeline footprint in the South, and Antero Midstream (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM\" title=\"Antero Midstream Corporation\">AM</a>), which owns the gathering and processing assets of Antero Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR\" title=\"Antero Resources Corporation\">AR</a>) in Appalachia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OKE yields 6.0% due to a weak oil price. While ONEOK’s business mostly consists of fixed-fee revenue, the stock tends to sell off when oil prices weaken. As it aims for 3-4% long-term dividend growth, this is a huge opportunity, as I expect a lot more demand for pipelines in America’s hottest energy region in the years ahead.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1536\" data-height=\"846\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ONEOK</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833570-my-favorite-2-stock-combo-for-next-decade\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833570-my-favorite-2-stock-combo-for-next-decade\" target=\"_blank\">Antero Midstream</a> yields 5.0%.

I would include it because of its wide-moat footprint in the DIY housing space, which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833229-coiled-spring-betting-on-my-top-picks-for-americas-next-housing-boom\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833229-coiled-spring-betting-on-my-top-picks-for-americas-next-housing-boom\" target=\"_blank\">I expect to benefit</a> from efforts to unlock the housing market, among its brilliant supply chain operations, and bigger push into the <a href=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2025/06-30-2025-130354727\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2025/06-30-2025-130354727\" target=\"_blank\">PRO segment</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, while it’s not cheap, I would include RTX Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>), which has both defense and commercial aerospace exposure. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831529-rtx-my-biggest-defense-investment-just-went-boom\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831529-rtx-my-biggest-defense-investment-just-went-boom\" target=\"_blank\">I think</a> the company will continue to return double digits every year. It now yields 1.5% with a five-year CAGR of 6.9% that I expect to increase due to strong earnings growth and accelerating free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, I would include some AI exposure here. Unfortunately, these are rather expensive right now, which is why I would likely stick to proven companies like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>). It yields just 0.3% but has proven to be able to both stand out in the LLM AI model space and use its massive installed base of billions of daily users to turn its advantage into high earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, what’s the bottom line?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Portfolio Overview &amp; Closing Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now comes another fun thing, which is putting everything together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below, I highlighted all the companies I mentioned. I included their yields and the average weighted yield. For that, I used the weighted yield contribution. You can ignore that, as it’s for calculation purposes only.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that the weighting is 100%. If we combine it with ETFs, that number obviously becomes 50%, and all weightings are cut in half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see, the average yield is 5.5% because the majority of the portfolio is invested in O, VICI, MAIN, OKE, and AM. This means that single stocks heavily compete with the weighting of some major ETFs. It’s not perfect for diversification, but it shows that if we want to include faster-growing stocks, we either need to change the ETF composition or accept that some stocks get a bigger weighting. As I went with ultra-high-quality companies, I am not too worried about this weighting.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1714\" data-height=\"648\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk here is MAIN’s 17% weighting. Because of its cyclical behavior, one could push that down to 10% and distribute 7 points over other higher-yielding stocks or add another pick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, this is just food for thought, not a portfolio I want everyone to copy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, so far, the portfolio has done well. Since January 2021, it has returned 17.8% per year, beating the DVY ETF’s 12.5% annual return by a wide margin. While it has a standard deviation of 16.5%, its worst drawdown since then was 15.5%, better than the 16.0% drawdown of DVY during this period.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1682\" data-height=\"892\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548013768542_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is what the chart looks like:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1682\" data-height=\"1090\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"415\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616548077807353_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are obviously many ways to construct a 50/50 portfolio, I think this stock selection can be a great foundation, as it has a great yield, fantastic companies, inflation protection, and what I expect to be a high probability of outperformance versus other dividend-focused ETFs and assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risks here are concentration risks, as we went with a few high-volatility ideas. Also, general risks like recession and market sell-offs apply.

AMLP yields 8.3%, while AM 5.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, the results reflected in the chart above clearly show that AM has some embedded growth engines that are certainly worth taking into the equation when making a decision whether AM should really be so easily avoided for income investors even though the yield difference seems indeed quite material. After all, buying a growth business with a yield of ~5% should be something that is certainly worth a closer look for almost any income investor</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, given this and the fact that AM just recently issued a Q3 <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1eaefacf739f3becdea63f12f778b175/anteromidstream/db/793/8050/pdf/AM+3Q25+Earnings+Call+Presentation_vF_10.30.25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings package</a> that indicates robust growth, I have become bullish on this stock, where the underlying case boils down to resilient cash flows and truly sustainable dividend at a reasonable price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent earnings report contains strong messages across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The year-over-year EBITDA increased by 11%, driven by organic growth (maintenance and growth CapEx) and previously made bolt-on acquisitions. However, I would say that the former component was the biggest contributor to the registered growth because of 99%+ uptime availability, 5% growth in compression volumes and 100% utilization rate on processing and fractionation activity. In other words, we could not have asked for something better on the operational side than what was achieved by AM in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, if we look at the cash flow dynamics, we will notice an uptick of 94% in the FCF generation (measured on a year-over-year basis). Given that the dividends have not changed over the past 12 months and while the EBITDA is indeed higher, we are obviously not talking about high double-digit figures; the only explanation that we have for this massive surge in the FCF generation is the reduced CapEx spend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is where things become interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimated total CapEx spend for 2025 is $180 million, which is roughly 4x below the average level in 2017 - 2019 period. At the same time, the full year EBITDA target for AM is slightly above $1.1 billion. Looking at the TTM figures, we can see that ~$200 million of the EBITDA result goes towards servicing debt, $180 million to CapEx and $435 million to dividends. This brings the dividend coverage to about 1.7x, which is already after CapEx and debt service coverage. And the surplus here is roughly $300 million that AM can retain in its books each year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Theoretically, this attractive story could be destroyed by an aggressive capital structure that would require AM to dedicate all of the excess cash flows toward debt reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real situation is the complete opposite. As of Q3 2025, AM carried a leverage of 2.8x, which is for sure one of the lowest levels in the entire midstream space. The balance sheet is just as competitive as for EPD. The good thing here is that AM has no debt maturities until 2028, and the notes that stand first in line for refinancings in 2028 and 2029 have a cost of debt at ~5.5% (on a weighted average terms), which implies no meaningful headwinds after the rollovers are made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So going forward, we should expect either intensified buybacks or additional bolt-on M&amp;A, where both are obviously accretive to the shareholders, especially considering the already optimized capital structure, where going lower would really not make sense from the value creation perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, I highly doubt that we will see further deleveraging (in a material way) given so strongly capitalized balance sheet, ample cash generation over dividends, and inherently de-risked top-line factor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the top-line factor, we have to appreciate AM's revenue linkage to fixed contracts. Today, AM has absolutely no commodity risk present in its cash generation profile, as all of the income stems from fixed-fee contracts that are further <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1eaefacf739f3becdea63f12f778b175/anteromidstream/db/793/8039/pdf/AM+Website+Presentation+August+2025_08.05.25_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">hedged</a> by an accretive collar on the production volume front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And, obviously, it is not only about the fixed, fee-based contracts but also about the underlying demand in the areas in which AM operates. As opposed to many peers, AM carries a significant focus on natural gas through its gathering and compression, processing and fractionation operations. Namely, there is no exposure to pure-play crude oil segments, which have become risky given the declining oil price over the past couple of quarters. Instead, AM's key business exposures allow it to directly participate in the structurally <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-natural-gas-demand-growth-set-to-accelerate-in-2026-as-more-lng-supply-comes-to-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing</a> natural gas area, that is mostly driven by the booming AI and the corresponding need for reliable baseload energy. In this context, we have to take into account AM's notable footprint in the Marcellus in which there is an elevated production activity due to extremely competitive <a href=\"https://info.evaluateenergy.com/low-breakevens-keep-marcellus-on-top/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">break-evens</a> for producers. This is clearly supportive for long-term and healthy demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, it seems that the market has also appreciated these aspects and baked into the cake a rather robust growth outlook for AM:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1533\" data-height=\"202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"EPS growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"84\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"84\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, it makes perfect sense given the fundamental tailwinds that I described above.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, I think that it would be fair to say that AM can be deemed as one of the most defensive midstream picks in the entire sector. When it comes to the leverage and distribution coverage, the situation is just as strong as for my top pick - EPD. In fact, AM is actually superior to EPD on the cash-flow predictability front due to its advantage of having 100% of the top-line linked to fee-based contracts, which is not the case for EPD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, AM trades at EV/EBITDA of 10.2x, which is just by 0.1x lower than for EPD. PAA, WES and ET trade at 9.0x, 8.7x and 8.3x, respectively, which is by 10% to 15% cheaper. Having said that, none of them have the capitalized balance sheet and cash flow durability factors of AM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the only thing that again makes the decision difficult for me (as a pure income investor) is the yield component. As stated above, the difference between rather similar (slightly lower quality but still defensive enough and sufficiently de-risked) midstream players and AM is about 3.2%, which is something that can move the needle. Also, in AM's recent <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1eaefacf739f3becdea63f12f778b175/anteromidstream/db/793/8039/pdf/AM+Website+Presentation+August+2025_08.05.25_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">investor presentation</a>, there are no indications of dividend hikes. Instead, the focus is put on buybacks and bolt-on M&amp;A, which is certainly supportive for price, but not necessarily dividend. Actually, if the price continues to go up and the dividend remains unchanged, the reinvestment yield will drop even further (e.g., below 5%).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, given the \"best of breed\" fundamental profiles in the space and relatively attractive initial yield, I have decided to make a slight allocation into AM.</p>",

Despite the recent deal, appetite to add inorganic growth remains intact if opportunities open up. </span><span>However, currently no formal processes are underway. The collaboration with YPF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YPF\" title=\"YPF Sociedad Anónima\">YPF</a>) in La Amarga Chica drives operational synergies. </span><span>Overall, Vista executed efficiently with no surprises. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The upcoming Investor Day on 12 November 2025 will outline the updated 2026+ strategy, cost initiatives, and long-term growth targets. For me, this will be even more important than the recent Q3 earnings release. Argentina’s elections are not seen as disruptive, having paved the way for operational growth and further stock price gains. The focus remains on profitable scale-up, cost discipline, and cash generation in a dollarized, export-oriented model, strengthening and de-risking the case.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vista remains far from cheap with a forward PE ratio of less than 9x. On an EV / operating cash flow basis, the multiple is around 10x – but using the working-capital depressed figure. I am using operating CF here instead of FCF, as Vista is pushing hard for growth, reinvesting every penny they can.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To My Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see mainly two risks: the first being a significantly lower oil price. Gas likewise plays a role, but Vista is mainly an oil producer, as we've seen above. Despite low production costs, lower energy prices and thus operating results could become uncomfortable at some point due to the currently more leveraged balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Point number two, obviously any negative news from the political landscape in Argentina. This includes issues with public finances, like recently, which can send all stocks tied to Argentina down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mentioned two risks, but a smaller third one could be if Vista pursues more acquisitions, especially when debt financed. This could weaken the balance sheet, and with it the equity portion of the enterprise value – the stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I reiterate my \"strong buy\" rating for Vista Energy. The recent challenges and confusions, especially from the political front, seem to be solved, at least for now. Further, Vista continues to excel operationally, having reached full export price parity. Production costs remain low, creating a strong buffer in the current environment of low oil prices. If and when oil prices turn up, Vista will be swimming in cash.</p>",

That's probably not a surprise.</p> <p>After all, companies with shareholder-oriented cultures and strong fundamentals tend to reward<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> shareholders year in and year out.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And why not? It's easy to do so when earnings are steadily climbing higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I'm looking for companies with many more years of earnings growth than decline (depending on the industry and the business cycle, at least 8 or 9 out of the last 10 years is preferable).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment-grade (BBB- and up from S&amp;P and Fitch or Baa3 or higher from Moody's) credit ratings from rating agencies are also what I'm seeking. That provides businesses with a low cost of capital, which can make it easier to sustain earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to cover businesses trading at appealing valuations. This brings us to the subject of today, which is the human capital management solutions provider, Paychex (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX\" title=\"Paychex, Inc.\">PAYX</a></span>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered Paychex with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716161-paychex-a-reliable-buy-for-growing-dividend-checks-now\">buy rating in August 2024</a>, I thought it could realistically achieve high-single-digit annual adjusted diluted EPS growth. I also liked the company's financial positioning. Lastly, I estimated shares were modestly undervalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to now, and we're reiterating our buy rating. Paychex's acquisition of Paycor in April is going well thus far, which reinforces our growth projections. The company's leverage ratio is exceptional, too.

The company's total revenue jumped 16.8% year-over-year to $1.54 billion in the quarter. For more context, that matched Seeking Alpha's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500166-paychex-non-gaap-eps-of-1_22-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-1_54b-in-line\">analyst consensus</a> during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The driving force of this topline growth had to do with <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/791/paychex-completes-acquisition-of-paycor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's acquisition of Paycor HCM</a> in April. The latter acquired the former for $4.1 billion. Strategically, this acquisition strengthened its competitive position upmarket by uniting the two to form an AI-enabled technology provider with top-notch service and advisory capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging deeper, Paychex's Management Solutions segment revenue soared 21% over the year-ago period to $1.16 billion for the first quarter. Of that amount, the company estimates that roughly 17% of the segment's topline growth was fueled by the aforementioned deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to CFO Robert Schrader's opening remarks during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826950-paychex-inc-payx-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q1 2026 Earnings Call</a>, higher revenue per client played into this growth. This was made possible by improved price realization and increased product penetration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's PEO and Insurance Solutions increased by 3.1% year-over-year to $329.1 million in the first quarter. An uptick in the number of average PEO worksite employees was the primary driver of this topline growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest on funds held for clients surged 26.9% over the year-ago period to $47.6 million. That mostly stemmed from higher average investment balances due to the Paycor acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shifting gears to the bottom line, Paychex's adjusted diluted EPS grew by 5.2% over the year-ago period to $1.22 during the first quarter. That was $0.02 ahead of the analyst consensus for the quarter (the 19th quarter out of the last 20 it has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX/earnings\">matched or exceeded</a> the analyst adjusted diluted EPS consensus). As the company was in the early stages of working Paycor into its business, its non-GAAP net profit margin contracted by 330 basis points to 28.6% in the quarter. This is why Paychex's adjusted diluted EPS growth lagged total revenue growth during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the company should have plenty of growth ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's because Paychex's integration of Paycor is going well, with it set to exceed its initial cost synergy target of $90 million for FY 2026. The company is also pursuing incremental synergies beyond this target while reinvesting those gains for further growth and innovation investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the revenue synergy side of the equation, the integration has also been encouraging. President and CEO John Gibson noted that the company closed an ASO cross-sale to a Paycor client with several thousand employees. That was among the largest in Paychex's history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, we're inclined to think that the FAST Graphs analyst consensus is in the ballpark, if not a bit low. For FY 2026, adjusted diluted EPS is anticipated to rise by 9.8% to $5.47. In FY 2027, another 7.6% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to $5.89 is projected. For FY 2028, an additional 5.6% growth in adjusted diluted EPS is being predicted (this will likely rise as more analysts provide their forecasts for the fiscal year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1450\" data-height=\"770\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A summary of Paychex's liquidity position and net leverage ratio as of August 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Paychex Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, Paychex is a financially sound enterprise. As of August 31st, 2025, the company's net leverage ratio was 1.2x. This is what earns Paychex a BBB+ S&amp;P credit rating with a stable outlook. That arguably sets it up to opportunistically execute what it views as complementary acquisitions (similar to Paycor) down the road (unless otherwise sourced or hyperlinked, all info in this subhead was according to <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/809/paychex-inc-reports-first-quarter-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's Q1 2026 Earnings Press Release</a> and <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_3d71fd2564896520cc343e0da5538808/paychex/db/883/8146/investor_presentation/Q1+FY26+Investor+Slides+Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fair Value Could Be Above $150 A Share</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1661\" data-height=\"835\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PAYX in FAST Graphs.\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"322\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs, FactSet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last 14 months, shares of Paychex have only gained 1%. In our view, this modest performance only further enhances the stock's appeal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's shares are priced at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 22. According to data from FAST Graphs, that's comfortably below the 10-year average P/E ratio of 27.9 (this was up incrementally from 27x as of August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving forward, we believe that a rational fair value P/E ratio for Paychex remains at around 27. What is our rationale?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, Paychex's profit margins are continuing to expand. The 28.6% non-GAAP net profit margin in Q1 2026 that we cited earlier is up significantly from 24.5% in <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/668/paychex-inc-reports-first-quarter-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q1 2021</a>. All else equal, a more profitable company supports our fair value P/E ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's more, Paychex's growth profile looks to be intact. For one, the FAST Graphs analyst consensus of $5.47 in adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2026 is higher than the consensus of $5.29 in August 2024. As is the consensus for FY 2027 of $5.89 for FY 2027 (it was $5.60 in FY 2026).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company's annual forward growth consensus is currently 7.3%. Considering that Paychex tends to beat adjusted diluted EPS expectations, this is comparable to the 10-year average annual growth rate of approximately 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, FY 2026 is about 41% complete. This leaves another 59% of FY 2026 and 41% of FY 2027 yet to come over the next 12 months. That produces a forward 12-month adjusted diluted EPS input of $5.64.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging this into our fair value P/E ratio of 27, we get a fair value of $152 a share. Relative to the current $124 share price (as of October 28th, 2025), this equates to a 19% discount to fair value. If Paychex matches growth forecasts and returns to fair value, it could generate a 27% total return by the end of November 2026. Through May 2031, it could post 13% annual total returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Strong Dividend Growth On The Horizon</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1541\" data-height=\"168\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PAYX in the Zen Research Terminal.\" width=\"640\" height=\"70\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's 3.5% forward dividend yield comes in well above the 1.5% median forward yield of the industrials sector and the 1.3% yield of the technology sector. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX/dividends/yield\">Seeking Alpha's Quant System</a> groups the company in the industrials sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it's arguably now more of a technology sector stock with its tech-driven HCM platform and recurring software as a service revenue profile. That's why we'll provide info for each sector, but we would consider technology to be the more appropriate classification. This sizable starting yield is enough for the Quant System to issue an A- grade for overall dividend yield (unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better yet, Paychex's outsized starting income looks to be secure. The company's adjusted diluted EPS payout ratio is expected to be in the high-70% to low-80% range for FY 2026. This is above the 60% payout ratio that rating agencies like to see from the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the higher payout ratio is more stable than it may initially seem. That's because Paychex is a free cash flow machine, with the free cash flow payout ratio anticipated to be in the low- to mid-70% range in FY 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not to mention the very low net leverage ratio on the balance sheet. From our perspective, these elements support the current payout ratio. This backs up the Quant System's A- grade for overall dividend safety (also unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why we also believe that Paychex can sustain high-single-digit annual dividend growth over at least the next several years. This jives with the Quant System's forward annual dividend growth per share forecast of 8.8%. That would be well above the industrial sector median of 6.4% (and the tech median of 6.5%). This warrants a B grade from the Quant System for this particular metric (also unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why we're confident that Paychex can build on its 14-year dividend growth streak. This itself is already more established than the industrial sector median of 3 years (and the tech sector median of 2.1 years). That explains the Quant System's A grade for overall dividend consistency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Consider</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex is a business with robust fundamentals. Yet, some risks could undermine the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I outlined 14 months ago, one key risk to Paychex is that it's effectively a United States pure play. In its FY 2025, ended in May, only about 1% of its total revenue was generated outside of the United States (per page 80 of 180 of <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-25-095300/0000950170-25-095300.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's 10-K Filing</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it will be critical for U.S. economic growth to continue to hold strong. This is most especially the case for small and medium-sized businesses in the country, since that is the company's core focus. Any particular challenges to these clients (e.g., slowing economic growth or rising inflation) could put a damper on Paychex's growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to the company is the scores of sensitive client data on its IT networks. If this is compromised in any way, impacted parties could bring litigation against Paychex. The company could also be hit with penalties by regulators. These events could cause an exodus of existing clients and make it more difficult for Paychex to attract new clients.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary: A Blue-Chip Deal Worth Buying Now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex checks many boxes for us. As the company further incorporates Paycor into its business mix, adjusted diluted EPS growth should be in the high single digits over the next few years. The market-beating payout is also adequately covered by earnings and free cash flow, signaling the potential for further dividend growth. Paychex's net leverage ratio is also vigorous.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clinching our buy case is the fact that shares are priced 19% under our fair value estimate. If Paychex lives up to growth expectations and reverts to our fair value, the stock could have an attractive 27% upside over the next 13 months. Over the next five and a half years, Paychex could put up 13% annual total returns. In closing, that's why we're maintaining our buy rating.</p>",

And while the Dividend King is a strong business<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and great long-term holding, their valuation appears a bit stretched, making them less appealing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock is in the green in the past year compared to peer PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>), which is down double digits. This is led by underperformance in their North American segments. And while KO has navigated current economic challenges better so far, their valuation seems more to do with investors flocking to safety because of economic uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I discuss KO's latest earnings, fundamentals, and why I suggest investors looking to buy to wait for a potential pullback.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last covered The Coca-Cola Company back in February in an article titled: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761426-coca-cola-strong-momentum-bullish-but-headwind-keeps-me-from-upgrading\"><em>Strong Momentum Is Bullish, But One Headwind Keeps Me From Upgrading. </em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the beverage giant has since experienced some volatility, the share price has remained relatively flat over the past 8 months. It is down close to 2%. The S&amp;P (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) has continued its upward trajectory, up 15.41%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2049\" data-height=\"928\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KO's headwinds that kept me at a hold were their valuation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and cash flow issues. Their cash flow was impacted by their tax litigation lawsuit with the IRS that required a $6 billion deposit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free cash flow was down 51%, with dividends exceeding (FCF) of $4.7 billion, bringing the payout ratio above 100%. But I did expect the dividend to remain safe despite temporary headwinds. Limited upside to their 2026 price target of $68.56 also kept me cautious as I suggested investors wait for a pullback near $60.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Earnings Delivery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned earlier, the beverage giant delivered <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831463-the-coca-cola-company-ko-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">a strong Q3</a> and saw their share price rally as a result. EPS of $0.82 beat by $0.04, while revenue of $12.5 billion beat by $90 million, solid considering financially challenged consumers. Year-over-year, both grew 6% and 5%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For comparison, PEP saw their bottom line decline slightly from $2.31 to $2.29, while revenue managed to increase modestly from $23.3 billion to $23.94 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PEP's performance in the past year has been impacted by performances in their North American segments. KO's performance was driven by a solid showing in their EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, where they saw growth of 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Bottling Investments, unit case volume grew 2%, up from the prior year's quarter, where it declined 31%. Activist investor Elliott Management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500105-eyes-on-pepsico-as-the-company-considers-a-refranchising-move\">recently took a $4 billion stake</a> in peer PEP, calling for the company to make strategic changes like KO with its bottling services, hoping to unlock value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, the move by KO to battle declining volumes seems to have panned out. And Pepsi could soon follow in their footsteps. KO continued to grow market share for the 18th consecutive quarter, driven by their digital transformation efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During earnings, KO announced that in July, they sold a 40% stake in their Indian-owned bottler. This is expected to close sometime in 2026 and unlock growth opportunities in India and Africa. This is also another reason KO has outperformed PEP, as they seem to always be a few steps ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin Improvements</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic revenue growth was 6%, while global unit volume grew a modest 1%, up from a decline of 1% the year prior. However, organic revenue was lower than the previous year's 9%, a testament to the challenging economic backdrop. Margins also expanded as a result, with operating margins increasing from 30.7% to <strong>31.9%</strong>. Gross margins also expanded nearly 100 basis points from 60.7% to <strong>61.5%</strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1647\" data-height=\"1065\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KO IP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow &amp; Guidance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a dividend-focused investor, I'm typically more concerned with a company's free cash flow even if they're Dividend Kings like KO and PEP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in their recent quarter, cash flow improved to $2.4 billion, bringing this to $8.5 billion year-to-date, excluding the Fairlife payment. The previous year's quarter cash flows were impacted by the IRS litigation payment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a positive note, management raised FCF guidance, thanks to lower capital expenditures expected. Cash from operations is expected to amount to $12 billion, while FCF is expected to be $9.8 billion, up from $9.5 billion previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic revenue is still expected in a range of 5% to 6%, and EPS growth of 8%. Solid in comparison to Pepsi, who's expecting earnings to be flat from 2024's $8.16.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KO's balance sheet was also in solid shape, with leverage well below their targeted range of 2.0x-2.5x at 1.8x. This, along with their A credit rating, gives the company flexibility should cash flows become impacted for any unforeseen reason, ensuring the dividend streak remains intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1853\" data-height=\"801\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KO IP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Coca-Cola Company has rallied since September, up close to 7%. This has pushed their valuation to a forward P/E of <strong>23.95x</strong> at the time of writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While KO offers safety and income stability, in my opinion this limits upside and could diminish investor returns going forward. PEP appears to be the better buy. Although, they've also rallied in the past month.

And should volumes pull back, a sell-off is likely to follow.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While The Coca-Cola Company remains one of the safest businesses, I believe macro uncertainty has led to investors flocking to safe-haven investments like KO.

These are the two key points relevant to investors:</p> <ol> <li>Trump aimed to confirm the committed DFI<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> investments into the US and claimed he secured up to </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-visits-south-korea-he-attempts-secure-billions-investment?msockid=342659ca3eb068631bc54d2d3fcc69a2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">$22 trillion in investments by the end of his first year in office</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in his speech in South Korea. Obviously, the US economic growth would accelerate next year if these investments were realized, but also inflation would increase as well.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump also met with the Chinese President Xi in South Korea, and they agreed to a broad 1-year truce, where part of the deal is a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html?msockid=342659ca3eb068631bc54d2d3fcc69a2\" rel=\"nofollow\">10% lower overall tariff</a> on imports from China, which reduces the overall inflation pressures, at least on margin. More importantly, a further tit-for-tat trade war escalation is now less likely, which reduces the overall macro uncertainty.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, on the surface, Trump's visit to East Asia has been successful, and the deals made are good for the US and the global economy - assuming that DFI commitments are actually realized and that the truce with China holds. However, there is considerable uncertainty whether these deals will hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro context</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump's visit to East Asia was important within the geopolitical and the macroeconomic context.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitics</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the geopolitical point of view, Trump's visit to East Asia was two-sided.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Trump met with the leaders of the key US geopolitical allies in the region, South Korea and Japan.</li> <li>However, Trump also met with the leader of the main geopolitical adversary, China, and narrowly avoided meeting the leader of another adversary, North Korea.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The State Department has a specific list of <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-E/part-791/subpart-A/section-791.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"foreign adversaries\" 15 CFR 791.4: </a></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The People's Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region (China)</li> <li>Republic of Cuba (Cuba)</li> <li>Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran)</li> <li>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)</li> <li>Russian Federation (Russia) and</li> <li>Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro (Maduro Regime)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 9th, China issued <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0656_china_rare_earth_controls_2025_61_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MOFCOM Notice No. 61.</a> in which it restricts the exports of rare earth materials for military use. Given that 1) China has nearly 90% control of global production and processing of rare earths, and 2) rare earths are essential in today's high-tech military equipment, China <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829908-us-china-trade-war-escalates-to-geopolitical-crisis\">escalated</a> the trade war to a major geopolitical situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In response, Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on China. It is also important to note that, just before the meeting with Xi, Trump announced that <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-appears-to-suggest-the-u-s-will-resume-testing-nuclear-weapons-for-first-time-in-30-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">the US will restart nuclear testing</a> on \"equal basis with Russia and China\".</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic growth</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump's domestic economic plan is heavily dependent on foreign capital.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>First, tariffs are considered an important source of government revenue, used to offset the tax cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill.</li> <li>Second, Trump pledged to lower the reciprocal tariffs for the countries that commit to invest in the US - and this is expected to be the major source of growth from 2026 onwards.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, economically, for the US, it is important to formalize the committed foreign investments and to ensure their effective implementation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deals with Japan and South Korea</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korea pledged a $350 billion investment to get the reciprocal tariff on autos reduced from 25% to 15%, and that includes $200 billion in cash, paid in installments of up to $20 billion per year, and $150 billion directed toward the U.S. shipbuilding industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem for South Korea is that $350 billion is 85% of its foreign exchange reserves. Thus, this investment will be very difficult and risky to implement. The US-South Korea deal does not specify how South Korea will raise funds to invest in the US. Thus, in my opinion, the actual implementation still remains uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-brings-home-more-billion-dollar-deals-during-state-visit-to-the-republic-of-korea/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the list of all specific projects</a> agreed upon between the US and South Korea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan pledged $550 billion to support U.S. industry and infrastructure and also to get the reciprocal tariff on autos reduced from 25% to 15%, out of which $332 billion is for critical energy infrastructure. Again, the problem is that such a large investment could strain the Japanese economy, since Japan would also commit public funds. No specifics were discussed in Japan about the source of funding for this DFI; thus, this investment also remains uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/28195/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the list of all specific projects</a> agreed upon between the US and Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Trump's deals with Japan and South Korea specified DFI projects, but their actual implementation is still highly uncertain given that no information has been given about the source of DFI funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, Trump signed the critical minerals agreement to 'further diversify the critical minerals supply chain' with Japan and the critical minerals access agreement with <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-peace-and-prosperity-in-malaysia/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malaysia</a>. This confirms the geopolitical aspect of the deals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deal with China</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China agreed to delay the implementation of the rare earth export ban for military use for one year - and that's the main outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting. Thus, the US now has a year to find alternative sources of rare earths, and it seems like the race is on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In return, Trump lowered the 20% fentanyl tariff down to 10%, which is not really a major concession. China also pledged to increase the purchases of soybeans, and both countries will start lowering trade barriers, such as port fees. Overall, these are minor concessions from both sides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market wanted to hear some positive news about Nvidia exports of Blackwell chips to China, but China seems to be on the path of self-reliance in high-tech, which supports the decoupling thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presidents Trump and Xi agreed to a temporary truce. However, the geopolitical situation remains tense, the US-Venezuela situation is escalating, the Russia-Ukraine war has no end in sight, and the fact that Trump invoked nuclear tests right before the meeting is also an escalation. Thus, there is uncertainty whether the truce will hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DFI investment is Trump's main plan for domestic growth, and tariffs are becoming an important part of government revenue. However, the Supreme Court will review the case in early November to decide whether the reciprocal tariffs are legal. If the Supreme Court upholds the lower court decision and rules against the Trump tariffs, the DFI pledges are unlikely to ever be implemented.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the Supreme Court rules in favor of tariffs, countries like Japan and South Korea will find it difficult to fully fund the pledged DFI. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty whether these DFI pledges will ever be fully implemented.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the Trump-Xi meeting and the deals with Japan and South Korea don't signal the return of globalization and free trade, which is what the market would want to hear.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global financial markets did not respond favorably to the outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting, with the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) falling by 1%, as the truce was already priced in. However, Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>) increased by almost 2%, which is the ultimate safe haven and, thus, the indicator of post-meeting uncertainty.</p>",
