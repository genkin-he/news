This is at meaningful discount from peer &amp; the sector averages.</p> <p>The company generated roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/profitability#:~:text=A%2B-,32.32%25,-5.58%25\">30% ROE</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on opening equity on TTM basis. That is significantly higher as compared to average ROE for the company. At the same time, the company had also been able to achieve meaningful earnings improvement on this period. The market most probably is assuming this to be a peak cycle performance rather than a normalized earning power and ROE for the company. While, the market is not entirely incorrect in its assessment — the current performance for that matter is due to the significant appreciation in the yellow metal. However, the factor which the market is not accounting for is that the company is actively investing in copper production. They recently did a $1 billion acquisition for Australian MAC copper. When we incorporate that into the account; there at least is very good chance that even if current ROE is somewhat compressed, still that would be materially higher than what company had been in normal cycles been able to achieve.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incorporating both the meaningful peer multiple discount with the copper catalyst, the company looks undervalued at current market price of $21 per share. If the company would not have been investing substantially in copper than current valuation would had been alright, but the market is not very keen on accounting for incremental business improvement resulting from the said expansion along with continued gold mining operations.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Overview</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony is a gold mining specialist with a growing international copper footprint. Harmony is the South Africa’s largest gold producer by volume and had been in the mining from last 75 years<strong>. </strong>The company operates nine underground and two surface mines in the region. Around 80% of revenue in South African operations comes from underground mining operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1414\" data-height=\"1302\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Business Overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"589\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Operational Overview <span>(Company-Integrated Annual Report )</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1513\" data-height=\"749\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Segment Info\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Segment Info <span>(Company-Integrated Report)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating Leverage </h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AISC (All-In Sustaining Costs) for Harmony Gold Mining had been around $1800oz on FY25 and the further guidance suggests AISC to come around $2000/oz for FY26. These numbers put Harmony Gold Mining in among top quartile (highest 25%) of global gold producers in terms of cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony Gold Mining is basically a high-cost producer of gold. The company with higher production costs sees a greater change in earnings with respect to changes in selling prices or revenue realizations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This keeps the company in a position to benefit much more than the sector averages, in terms of metal price strengthening, while at the same time also exposing the company to greater variability on downside.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Brief</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony had a liquidity of over $1 billion in FY25 with a <a href=\"https://www.harmony.co.za/media/announcements/2025/fy25-results-final-dividend-28aug2025/#:~:text=Liquidity%20of%20R20%20925%20million%20%28US%241%20179%20million%29%20in%20cash%20and%20undrawn%20facilities\" rel=\"nofollow\">cash balance of $600 Million</a>. The balance sheet gave a comfortable picture with total equity book value of around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/balance-sheet#:~:text=Print-,Balance%20Sheet,-Period\">$2.7 Billion and a negligible borrowing</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, <a href=\"https://www.harmony.co.za/media/announcements/2025/harmony-completes-mac-copper-acquisition-24oct2025/#:~:text=Harmony%20completes%20MAC%20Copper%20acquisition%2C%20securing%20full%20ownership%20of%20CSA%20mine%20and%20unlocking%20immediate%20copper%20production\" rel=\"nofollow\">post $1 Billion acquisition of MAC Copper</a> which would reflect in balance sheet of later period would add to a little financial leverage since company drew down around $900 million from bridge funding for completing the acquisition. Nevertheless, strong cash generation ability of Harmony would allow it to repay/refinance the loan as and when needed and continue maintaining a good liquidity standing.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Catalysts</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company recently acquired <a href=\"https://www.harmony.co.za/media/announcements/2025/harmony-completes-mac-copper-acquisition-24oct2025/#:~:text=Harmony%20completes%20MAC%20Copper%20acquisition%2C%20securing%20full%20ownership%20of%20CSA%20mine%20and%20unlocking%20immediate%20copper%20production\" rel=\"nofollow\">MAC COPPER LTD</a>, securing 100% ownership of the high-grade CSA copper mine in New South Wales, Australia. The company paid around $1 Billion for the said acquisition. Considering the total equity capital to be around $2.7 Billion in FY25 and $4.5 billion in total assets — this is a significant capital allocation from the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This not only provides the company direct exposure to the copper production but at the same time delivers the intent of the management to not just be a regional South African gold producer but to become a global commodity producer with international presence. That is not an insignificant leap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodity Tailwinds include both gold &amp; copper, which are experiencing an interesting trajectory currently. Being a high operating leverage producer, Harmony Gold Mining stands to benefit directly from sustained strength in gold prices, with incremental price gains flowing directly into top-line and earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Simultaneously, copper expansion positions the company to participate in the structural demand growth in copper.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Perspective</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current TTM Price multiple is at a discount to around 30% with the sector average as well as rather moderate considering the standalone multiple for Harmony at this time with TTM being just 16x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"999\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sector/Peer Comparison <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly the forward multiple according to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/earnings/estimates#:~:text=Jun%202026-,Consensus%20EPS%20Estimates,-3.02\">consensus EPS estimates</a> is just around 8x which is fairly cheap by any mean, even after accounting for higher production costs for Harmony and some regional in-efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can have a glance at Return on capital to further breakdown the Price to Earnings multiple for Harmony and see, if we can get any rationale from that for current multiples for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company, today has a very impressive return on invested capital. Reading ROIC in comparison with P/B and P/E provides an interesting picture and a paradox, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Price to Earnings is really a variable of reinvestment rate i.e. how much of earnings- the company is able to reinvest in its operations and a return on invested capital it can generate — ROIC/ROE. The fluctuations in either of two would meaningfully affect the ideal price to earnings multiple for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now while looking into price to earnings alone reflects a fairly cheaper business valuation but when we closely analyze the above chart comparing ROIC and Price to book — this shows that current ROIC of the company is at the highest end. Basically, the market doesn't expect the incremental earnings to be reinvested with similar rate of return. And the market is not entirely incorrect in this assessment. The current Price to book is also on a higher end for a commodity player like a Harmony.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It seems that market also thinks about current higher ROIC to be because of appreciation of gold rather than a structural change in the operations of the company. To put it up in short- the market does not think current ROIC or ROE to be real reflector for the earnings power of the enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we have a somewhat peculiar picture: the earnings multiple, when viewed in isolation, either on a standalone basis or relative to peers—appear fairly cheap and compelling; yet, a closer examination of the underlying drivers of those earnings contradicts that assertion .</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think that the company could redeploy large portion of incremental earnings at this rate of return over the long period of time as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, to conclude this section — it offers an interesting paradox — looking at certain lenses might cause an investor to believe the stock to be significantly undervalued but a closure second order look reflects at-least that might not be the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if the copper planning gets executed as per the planning — the valuation case would become quite stronger, but its contingent to the management executions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Section</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony, at the end of the day, is a commodity player with revenue and earnings tied to the price of gold and related commodities. Any severe and sustained gold price decline is enough to materially depress both the fundamentals of the business and the market valuations of the shares.<em> </em>Also company earning majorly in USD while cost structure being on ZAR, foreign exchange movements between USD/ZAR can impact the margins on either way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographically, operations are concentrated in South Africa, a jurisdiction historically associated with structural issues. including regulatory uncertainty, labour disruptions, and political shifts among others. The company further is not seen well from ESG lenses, being in mining and at the same time human cost resulting due to Harmony's operations cannot be ignored. There would also be many institutions and investors who despite the attractiveness of the company would not invest in the company. The negative perception and political sifts have the potential to materially trouble both the operations of the company and share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, like highlighted above, the company is keen on allocating capital to business expansion than retuning via share buybacks or dividends. While this seems good strategy but it can go other way as well and any misallocation would result in value destruction. This create an execution risk which needs to be actively tracked. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, the above outlined risks are selective and not exhaustive. As a commodity miner, Harmony remains subject to all other broader risks inherent to the mining industry. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony Gold is primarily an investment case on the commodity cycle rather than a purely operationally driven business. The company remains a beneficiary of both strengthening precious metal prices and the structural demand shift toward higher copper consumption, for which it is allocating a sizable amount of capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is largely an investment proposition for those who hold a favorable view on the commodity cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"996\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Charting\" width=\"640\" height=\"398\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Comparison <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last 10 years, Harmony Gold has significantly outperformed SPDR Gold Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>). While gold has delivered approximately a 3x price return, Harmony has generated nearly a 6x price return over the same period, excluding dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors constructive on gold, it offers a compelling proposition. However, the company cannot entirely detach itself from commodity fluctuations, nor can it benefit from metal appreciation without being adversely affected if the cycle reverses. Price hedging is not costless and is, at best, a short-term strategic tool. Ultimately, both the company’s performance and share price trajectory will remain contingent on the commodity price cycle.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opinion</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a current price of $21.49 it's a buy, but primarily as a proxy for the commodity cycle, majorly gold, and suitable only for those with a favorable view on the yellow metal and copper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the near term, if we see further material upside in gold, or if the consensus estimate of FY26 EPS of around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/earnings/estimates#:~:text=Jun%202026-,Consensus%20EPS%20Estimates,-3.02\">$3 per share</a> comes to materialize -there is a reasonable change for the stock to trade at around $25-$30 range from current levels. However, this remains dependent on commodity pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, if the commodity cycle continues as it has, the company has the potential to outperform the price returns of both the general stock market indices and even the underlying commodity it produces.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, potential risk needs to be evaluated carefully while committing capital in this company. This remains a probabilistic proposition eventually.</p>",

The stock has been range-bound between $190 and $215, as there has been a battle between excellent current profitability and fears about future margin compression.

That brought full-year earnings to an excellent $34.83. In property-liability, underwriting profits more than doubled to $4 billion thanks to a reserve release and much lower catastrophe losses as its combined ratio improved 14% to 72.9%. In 2025, no major hurricanes hit the mainland U<span>nited States</span>, which is fairly unusual, and this created a very favorable underwriting environment—one that is unlikely to be consistently repeated in my view. This provided a $200 million benefit to underwriting income, but even absent that, we are seeing material profit improvement thanks to improving expenses and strong core underwriting results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Drilling into results, auto underwriting profits tripled to $1.85 billion. Auto premiums earned rose 3% as policy count grew 2%, implying just modest price increases. Since COVID, physical damage costs have increased by 47%, while injury costs rose 52%. This led to a significant increase in auto insurance premiums as profitability was squeezed. Having raised prices substantially, profitability is on a much better footing, to the point where some providers like Progressive (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGR\" title=\"The Progressive Corporation\">PGR</a>) have to give <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article314805888.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article314805888.html\" target=\"_blank\">rebates</a>. This has raised concerns about deflation and margin compression going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Auto margin fears are now overdone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s combined ratio was 81%, down 12.7<span> percentage points</span> from last year. There was also a $715 million benefit from releasing prior-year reserves, as the severity of claims was better than previously modeled. Reserve releases are always good to see, as it means past policies are outperforming modeled expectations, speaking to conservative underwriting assumptions. However, benefits, especially of this magnitude, are more one-time in nature. Still, its run-rate combine ratio was 90.4%, which is excellent. In this sector, I like to see a combined ratio below 95%, so Allstate is outperforming this materially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see below, auto insurance premium inflation has been decelerating for several years since peaking in 2023 above 10%. Premiums tend to lag overall inflation trends since most policies are 6-12 months in nature. This is why the post-COVID inflation spike initially pressured margins, forcing outsized subsequent price increases. As price increases restored margins, that has brought capital back into the market, increasing competition and pressuring prices.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1118\" data-height=\"557\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>St. Louis Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At ~3%, auto premiums are still rising similar to the overall rate of inflation, which should limit potential margin compression. However, the trajectory is the source of concern. If we see premiums continue to decelerate, that could cause underwriting income to narrow (holding cat activity constant; this obviously can vary meaningfully year by year). Margin expansion from current levels on auto policies is highly unlikely; however, with premiums still rising, I believe fears of a significant deterioration in underwriting income are also unlikely. I am targeting 0-150bps of margin erosion this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other units are performing well</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Homeowners underwriting income was up 69% to $1.8 billion as premiums earned grew 14% to $4.1 billion. Its policy count grew by 2.5% from last year, and we have seen stronger pricing dynamics here relative to auto. Its total combined ratio fell by 14.5% to an excellent 55.3%, though cat losses declined by 46% given the quieter storm season. Still, its underlying combined ratio was 810bps to 51.4%. As the company has been rolling off legacy National General products and shifting to its Allstate-branded policies, we have seen favorable margin trends. Q4 results were unsustainably strong, as there will be hurricanes, but still the underwriting results are excellent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its smaller Protection Services unit increased revenue 12% to $3.3 billion during 2025, with it reaching $917 million in Q3. Policies in force rose by 3% to $172 million. ALL has been aggressively trying to grow this product warranty business to better diversify its exposures. Importantly, this growth is flowing to the bottom line as ALL widens distribution and improves scale. Net income rose 32% to $49 million in Q4.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet supports capital returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to the favorable interest rate environment, net investment income remains strong at $892 million, up about $60 million from last year. This was primarily due to strength in its fixed income portfolio, as it benefits from reinvesting maturities in the current rate environment. Importantly, Allstate has a high-quality investment portfolio, which now stands at $83.2 billion. About $59 billion of this sits in fixed income, with another $5 billion of cash equivalents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance-based income actually declined by $21 million to $146 million, and returns were just 6% in 2025. The entire industry has struggled with below-target alternative investment returns as real estate and private equity have lagged, given the elevated rate environment. I expect this to remain the case in 2026, with returns likely to remain below the 8%-12% that needs to be achieved over the medium term to justify the extra capital cost associated with these higher-risk investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside earnings, Allstate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547956-allstate-raises-dividend-by-8-to-108\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547956-allstate-raises-dividend-by-8-to-108\" target=\"_blank\">increased</a> its dividend by 8%, and shares now offer a 2% dividend yield. In addition, the company authorized a new $4 billion repurchase program. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 1.5% from last year, and I expect a faster pace of share count reduction in 2026. Allstate’s holding company, which is the entity that pays the dividend and repurchases stock, maintains an excellent financial position with $7.5 billion of assets. As such, I view its dividend as highly secure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is too low, making ALL a \"Buy\"</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in November, I was targeting $22-$24 in 2025 EPS. Core underwriting standards entered this year a bit stronger than I initially hoped, especially in the homeowners’ segment. With the larger buyback, we also may see a faster reduction in the share count than I previously anticipated. As such, assuming a normal cat season (which is really unknowable until Q3), I view EPS as likely to be $23.50-$25.50. This leaves shares around 8.5x earnings, giving ALL a “B-” Seeking Alpha valuation score, though it gets a better score on P/E metrics.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1064\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"stock chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This low multiple speaks to the fears about earnings compression. Thus far, though, all signs point to a more modest pace of compression, especially with auto premiums still up. Plus, the more gradual the normalization, the greater the offset to EPS from share buybacks. A shrinking share count can help offset tighter margins while keeping EPS around current levels. Markets are also pricing in some risk about autonomous vehicles reducing insurance demand, though I view this as a very long-term risk in nature.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While valuation is likely to be capped by these factors, I view its current multiple as demonstrably cheap. Whereas much of the sector can trade closer to 12x in my view, I view auto-exposed insurers as likely capped closer to 10x. Still, this points to a ~$240+ fair value. Even with shares at the top of their trading range, I remain a <span>\"B</span>uy.\" If results remain resilient, I believe ALL can break out and reach new highs, making shares an attractive \"Buy\" at current levels.</p>",

In this industry, the market is extremely concentrated, which is why the Index's float-adjusted market-cap-weighting scheme results in more than 45% allocated to just two stocks: Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>) and Eli Lilly and Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>).

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTRS\" title=\"Viatris Inc.\">VTRS</a>), and based on IHE's ~80% allocation to the following top ten holdings, it's a pretty non-diversified product.

As benchmarks today, I'll analyze IHE alongside the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IYH\" title=\"iShares US Healthcare ETF\">IYH</a>) and the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWV\" title=\"iShares Russell 3000 ETF\">IWV</a>), with the goal of highlighting how IHE is fundamentally stronger than the broader Health Care sector and overall market right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IHE Performance Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, I want to acknowledge how IHE has significantly lagged behind both benchmarks over the last ten years. As shown below, a $10K investment in IHE on March 1, 2016, would only grow to $23,335 on February 23, 2026, compared to $27,527 and $39,786 for IYH and IWV, respectively. You can see how IHE struggled in the early years, but it's started to gain some ground in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1744\" data-height=\"724\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IHE, IYH, IWV Performance Analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, IYE is up a solid 7.36% in 2026 compared to almost flat returns for IYH and IWV, and that's followed an impressive 31.68% gain last year that trounced both benchmarks.

In LLY's case, management anticipates increased use of its popular diabetes and obesity drugs (Mounjaro and Zepbound), and in the company's <a href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/static-files/45a92498-43d0-4e2d-a4e6-a9131841cfd6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 Investor Presentation</a>, noted EPS guidance in the $33.50-$35.00 range, which represents ~41% growth.

The following table, which highlights growth rates for IHE's top ten holdings, show that the portfolio's next-year sales and earnings growth rates of 11.88% and 19.07% are in line with their three-year rates, so I don't think it's overly aggressive. However, the same can't be said for IYH and IWV. Their next-year EPS growth rates are above their three-year annualized averages, which might flag that they're unsustainable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1757\" data-height=\"538\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IHE Top Ten Holdings - Growth and Valuation Metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Snapshots Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Johnson &amp; Johnson, Eli Lilly, and Merck &amp; Co. are relatively expensive for the Health Care sector based on their P/E ratios. However, IHE still has plenty of other cheaper stocks to balance things out, including Pfizer, which trades at just 9.00x forward earnings. When combining each ETF's forward P/E and one-year estimated EPS growth rates, IHE easily comes out on top, hence, my conclusion that it's a terrific GARP ETF.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IHE: 15.69x / 19.07% = 0.82x</li> <li>IYH: 18.96x / 16.60% = 1.14x</li> <li>IWV: 22.18x / 17.60% = 1.26x</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, it's a bonus that many of IHE's top holdings have excellent EPS Revision Grades from Seeking Alpha. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly are up 40% and 47%, respectively, over the last six months, and with high-growth stocks like these, it's crucial that analyst earnings forecasts trend upward to sustain price momentum and avoid the price-multiple compression that often plagues high P/E stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1779\" data-height=\"344\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IHE Quant Factor Grades - High EPS Revisions Scores For U.S. Pharmaceutical Stocks\" width=\"640\" height=\"124\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IHE: Growth Potential Beyond Eli Lilly</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since Eli Lilly is expected to be IHE's main earnings growth driver for at least the next several years, it's reasonable to consider just owning it individually and skipping IHE's 0.38% expense ratio. However, M&amp;A activity trends and expectations are good for the entire pharmaceuticals industry, so it's not the best strategy to tie your success to a single company whose earnings growth is expected to be roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY/valuation/price-earnings-peg-ratios\">127% in aggregate</a> over the next four years. The potential for negative earnings surprises will be present each quarter, and based on my general investment philosophy, that will impact high P/E stocks like LLY the most.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning back to M&amp;A activity, <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/as-big-pharmas-next-patent-cliff-looms-biotech-investors-see-dollar-signs\" rel=\"noopener\">Pitchbook</a> notes how a patent cliff is looming, with \"some $180 billion in pharma revenue\" going off patent in 2027-2028. That should spur an increase in deals to replenish lost revenues. Furthermore, IHE is market-cap-weighted, and based on data from Seeking Alpha, its top ten holdings control roughly 80% of the cash on hand in the industry ($78 billion/$90 billion). That means several other stocks, particularly Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Pfizer Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>), are well-positioned to benefit from increased M&amp;A activity.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table class=\"table-striped\"> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Ticker</td> <td>IHE Weight</td> <td>Total Cash (MRQ)</td> <td>Cash % in IHE</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ/balance-sheet\">JNJ</a></td> <td>24.84%</td> <td>$20,102,000,000</td> <td>21.62%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY/balance-sheet\">LLY</a></td> <td>21.40%</td> <td>$7,268,000,000</td> <td>7.82%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK/balance-sheet\">MRK</a></td> <td>5.19%</td> <td>$18,214,000,000</td> <td>19.59%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMY/balance-sheet\">BMY</a></td> <td>4.89%</td> <td>$10,673,000,000</td> <td>11.48%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTRS/balance-sheet\">VTRS</a></td> <td>4.72%</td> <td>$1,157,100,000</td> <td>1.24%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZTS/balance-sheet\">ZTS</a></td> <td>4.48%</td> <td>$2,312,000,000</td> <td>2.49%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPRX/balance-sheet\">RPRX</a></td> <td>4.35%</td> <td>$637,496,000</td> <td>0.69%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE/balance-sheet\">PFE</a></td> <td>4.33%</td> <td>$14,986,000,000</td> <td>16.12%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELAN/balance-sheet\">ELAN</a></td> <td>3.21%</td> <td>$505,000,000</td> <td>0.54%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAZZ/balance-sheet\">JAZZ</a></td> <td>2.64%</td> <td>$2,046,074,000</td> <td>2.20%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Recommendation</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IHE is a $1 billion U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF with excellent GARP features. On one side, roughly half the portfolio is comprised of high-growth stocks like Eli Lilly, while the other half includes cheaper ones like Pfizer. It's this balance that's appealing, and that's reflected in portfolio-level metrics like 19.07% one-year estimated EPS growth rate and a 15.69x forward P/E ratio. Seeking Alpha also reports high earnings revision scores for many of its top holdings, and these are good reasons why IHE is currently on a nine-month winning streak and has easily outperformed the market over the last year. Therefore, due to its solid fundamentals and my optimistic M&amp;A outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry, I've assigned IHE a \"buy\" rating, and I hope to keep the conversation going with you in the comments section below. Thank you for reading.</p>",

While the firm increased prices by 4% and also benefited from currency tailwinds - 2% - the soft demand for their products significantly outweighed these benefits. Volume was down by as much as 7% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the soft demand was, however, limited to the tools and outdoor segment only. Revenue in tools and outdoor fell by 2% year-over-year, driven by soft demand all around the globe. Especially power tool demand was weak. Volume in the segment fell by as much as 9%. On the other hand, the engineered fastening segment performed relatively well. Volume was up 7%, prices were up 1%, and currency tailwinds were 1%. The demand was primarily driven by the strength in the aerospace and automotive industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2532\" data-height=\"1400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Segment results <span>(Stanley Black &amp; Decker)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two other positive things for the quarter need to be highlighted here. First, margins; second, debt. SWK managed to expand its adjusted gross margin to 33.3% from 31.2% in the prior year as a result of increased prices, tariff mitigation, and reduced supply chain costs. When it comes to debt, it is very promising to see how disciplined the firm is in terms of debt reduction. Over the past 2 years, net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined from 5.9x to 3.4x, supported by the firm's free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2538\" data-height=\"1420\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Margins and debt <span>(Stanley Black &amp; Decker)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us look a bit forward now, and let us try to formulate some expectations. When it comes to the consumer, we cannot say that there is much to be optimistic about. Consumer confidence slightly increased this year, but not meaningfully. We are still close to the 10-year lows. As long as sentiment is poor, I do not see a significant increase in demand for SWK's products on the horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1976\" data-height=\"1004\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">U.S. Consumer sentiment <span>(tradingeconomics.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the industry, things look a bit better. The ISM Manufacturing PMI has been staying below 50 for quite a while now, but in January the reading went well above 50, the first time at this level since mid-2022. A reading below 50 means that the manufacturing economy is generally declining, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion. If the reading were to stay at the current levels for a sustained period of time, I believe SWK could benefit from the potential industry expansion tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1970\" data-height=\"1114\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ISM Manufacturing <span>(tradingeconomics.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the firm's own expectations, they foresee a mid-single-digit growth in the long term, but these expectations should be reflected only in the 2028 financials.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTR\" title=\"Nutrien Ltd.\">NTR</a></span>). This is a company I haven't reviewed in over 4 years, and I no longer own stock. My previous article from 2021<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> can be </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4464289-nutrien-stock-valuation-opportunity-now\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">found here</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> - but given that the thesis at the time was \"broken\" when the company appreciated very significantly, I sold out of that position after only a few months of holding it.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, as well as related pesticides and seed technologies, are very volatile sectors. Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because they reflect the very volatile underlying tendencies in a volatile agriculture and chemical market. To expect these companies to be anything but volatile would be to expect them to go against their natural tendencies, as with most basic materials or energy stocks, which are equally correlated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That doesn't mean they are not attractive, or cannot be attractive investments. They certainly can, and are, under the right type of circumstance. That's what I invest in, have invested in in the past, and will continue to invest in going forward. But the return, as well as how the company has performed over time (the volatility is what I am referring to here), highlights the importance of a valuation-oriented approach to ensure that you do not \"stay\" in a company when it is overvalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I'll do here is provide a thorough business update for Nutrien, look at what the company might deliver going forward, given the macro situation (this is very important when it comes to fertilizers and agriculture), and what, if any, alternatives there are to invest in here. Alternatives are important. I believe the acceptable \"spread\" in terms of PT/FV here are fairly low, and given also the general state of market overvaluation, you want to keep things relatively \"tight\" here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see what we have for Nutrien in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nutrien: A reflection of the issues and challenges in global fertilizers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some significant news that seems to have not been highlighted all that much here on SA happened in mid-December of 2025. The relevance to these sorts of macro news is reflected in the company's volatile trends since that time, as well as the outlook that we have for Nutrien going forward. As a result of U.S./Belarus deals about potash sanctions, Nutrien's stock fell about 4% during the day of the news - but this only adds to what I already believe is a complex thesis for fertilizer globally here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact that the U.S. and other countries beholden by U.S. sanctions have <em>not imported Belarusian potash</em> has meant a meaningful advantage for Nutrien and other native producers of Potash. Other producers worth noting here are Mosaic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>), which I also cover from time to time. These sanctions have been in place for almost 3-4 years, so when they were cancelled, it means reintroduction of a fair bit of capacity that until that point was curtailed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of the reason why I was able to sell Nutrien at such record high levels was due to significant pricing increases for potash, in part related to exactly those trends. Potash has trended between $280-$350 per metric tonne or so for past period. The current price estimate is between $320 and $345 for the full year - my own forecasts, due to more capacity online, is at $310.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potash has a current advantage relative to alternatives like nitrogen or phosphate, which are currently more expensive, and with farmer margins being pressured, it's easy to understand that farmers are prioritizing soil health (which potash helps with). There are also the macro considerations that current stockpiles in both China and India for the coming year are relatively low. If Potash drops under, say $300/share, and Nutrien drops as a result of this, then I would probably be interested in buying more. The reason would be that potash would have gotten too cheap at that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nutrien operates both in NA and also has a significant market share in Brazil. The fact that it's not the biggest Chinese producer doesn't matter. What we're looking at is a global market - trends affect these companies, even if they are not in those markets to begin with. The fact that Nutrien is also a world leader in fertilizers like Nitrogen and phosphorus is another reason to be both positive and careful - even an upside in one might not weigh up the downside in another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arguments for investing in Nutrien, as in other crop and fertilizer companies, are timeless. You have the \"arable land\" argument, which is that the amount of land only shrinks. You have macro trends like urbanization and the like, and this has led to an assumption that we'll see a demand/supply crunch where demand would significantly outpace the current available supply, or even planned supply additions. if this was to be the case, then yes - what we have here is a potential for appeal, provided we get it cheap enough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A big reason that I'm a bit more positive on potash than others, is that I see a demand potential in <em>both China and India. </em>These countries currently use less potash in farming than is being scientifically recommended to maintain soil health. To balance this, I consider it likely that we'll see an increase in use of Potash, which the countries will be unable to handle by themselves. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At heart, Nutrien is a qualitative business. The company is BBB rated, it has a very solid yield, even if that yield is only 3.1% (meaning in terms of yield safety), and its business model has for some time ensured that it's not generally subject to the same sort of volatile ups and downs that the remainder of the sector. At least, the company has fewer of them. Back in 2023, profits dropped by over 60%, but this was part of a similar trend across most of the fertilizer space - so that's not surprising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect that Potash will continue to generate about 30% of the company's EBIT over time. Part of the favorable outlook on Potash for Nutrien specifically is that most of the company's product is mined at low cost with very solid circumstances in Canada. Nitrogen is trickier, due to the correlation to NatGas prices. I don't expect a significant advantage from the phosphate business - its cost curve relative to other producers is middling, which means this is the least important of the company's business segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1596\" data-height=\"846\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, 2025 was a good performance year for the company. Nutrien report growth in sales for fertilizers, better earnings, and continued solid execution of its performance program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's 13% increase in EBITDA is worth highlighting here, related to record sales for the company, thanks to good growth from most of the key areas. Headwinds and \"weights\" on results continue to be things like overall crop protection products and an upswing in expenses. The company has delivered 2026E estimates, with a range of about $1.95B on the high end for EBIITDA, marking another significant increase in the company's bottom line - at least potentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1674\" data-height=\"840\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason why I think this estimate is just a bit too positive overall is the state of the market. The entire bull case for Nutrien hinges on the assumption that potash will continue to be a cost-effective alternative for farmers looking to fertilize as opposed to other fertilizers. I would argue, as some other analysts do as well, that one might be missing the forest for the trees with this argument. That \"forest\" argument is that <em>income for agriculture is down, and given inflation and costs doesn't seem to go back up. </em>Normalized prices for core seeds and grains, such as corn have actually dropped. If we instead of a demand growth work with a <em>demand decline</em>, then the picture for Nutrien would very quickly look different. Furthermore, with the company's new project (it's called Jansen, in Canada), it remains uncertain how much the company is actually capable of raising its prices, given the significant amount of capacity that this brings to the table.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oh, and if Russia comes back to the world market, then I would say that \"bets are off\" in terms of forecast - even if on paper, those exports already have seen <a href=\"https://tadviser.com/index.php/Article:Export_and_import_of_fertilizers_in_Russia#:~:text=According%20to%20Vedomosti%2C%20the%20largest,3%25%20to%204.8%20million%20tons.\" rel=\"nofollow\">a bit of recovery.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To say that the market and industry is complex, is therefore a bit of an understatement. What I would remember is the following. Russia, Belarus and Canada represent <em>over 75% of global potash. </em>The geopolitical macro has delivered a very good situation for Nutrien when these were \"locked out,\" but this is now normalizing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would be careful how I value the company going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation for Nutrien - two ways to see it and how I see it</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will be for the U.S. ticker NTR, so all amounts and estimates will be made in USD. My assumption is that Nutrien's AEPS growth will be less than expected. Following solid results in 2025, I don't think we'll see upside going forward - flat, negative or at best 1-2% AEPS growth on a forward basis. That means that I don't want to overpay for Nutrien or put the company really at any sort of premium multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's average is 15x. I'm fine with that multiple, even if it might in some instances be too high for what the company offers here. At 15.13, the company's long-term average, your rate of annualized return is less than 10%/year for me, working with a fair value target of about $72/share, meaning slightly below the target we have at the time of submission of this article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1464\" data-height=\"1352\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nutrien Upside F.A.S.T graphs\" width=\"640\" height=\"591\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nutrien Upside F.A.S.T graphs <span>(Nutrien Upside F.A.S.T graphs)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way that I see it is as follows. If you want to argue for a higher multiple or higher growth, you <em>have to assume success in the company's higher-level ambitions or macro assumptions. </em>Those that I spoke about in the section previously. Essentially, if you don't (like me) believe that these are likely, then the conclusion should be that you may want to be conservative on this company and its forecasts and future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I want if I am to invest here is a <em>discount that beats the market even in the event of a bearish turnout.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So that is what I am looking for. I find this representation of a break in potash and general fertilizer assumptions by applying a $69/share fair value, with a price target, or PT, of $56/share. My valuation target works with an assumption of $300/mt of Potash pricing, but with a margin contraction from lower farmer returns. Unless I get that PT, I'm not interested in investing here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nutrien is saying that fundamentals are improving and that demand is good. My counterpoint to this is that it's not as good as they are presenting, and I believe risks to be higher than this, as presented above. So, fair value target of $69/share with a midpoint retail EBITDA target of $1.7B at most, with contraction due to macro difficulties, at which point, I'd be willing to invest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second way to view it, to tie back to the header for this portion, is that you assume the <em>company's assumptions materialize. </em>In this scenario, I could easily see a fair value closer to $75-$80/share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from risks mentioned above, what I would add is the historical validation from the volatility in commodities as well as crop nutrients. The past few years have been volatile for sure, and there's no real sign that this is about to change - I wouldn't want to be the investor who argues the market is getting \"more stable\" here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I simply think it's a hard argument to make that Nutrien will be able to, over time, outperform the pricing trends set to be brought about by the supply additions that we're likely to see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I'm more conservative than many investors seem to be here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I consider Nutrien to be one of several interesting fertilizer companies, together with investments I've made in Yara (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YARIY\" title=\"Yara International ASA\">YARIY</a>), Mosaic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>), and companies like K+S (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KPLUY\" class=\"ticker-link\">KPLUY)</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one of the things about fertilizers is that these companies are exposed to very volatile macro and commodity tendencies. Furthermore, the recent years have seen supply exclusion, which is now being \"added back\" - and this, together with the compressed margins for farmers, which works against the positive assumptions being made for the sector, means that I'm more neutral/bearish than I am bullish here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using conservative metrics and assumptions, I put a $56/share PT on Nutrien based on a $69/share FV as of February 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</em></li> <li><em>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</em></li> <li>This company is currently cheap.</li> <li>This company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators, and 0 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 3/5 \"stars\" here, which typically isn't enough. Based on this, and a price target of $56/share, I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a Hold rating as of February 2026.</p>",

A couple of those deals fell over into 2026, but no deals fell out. So we're closing on everything that we said we would close on, on our last call. Our investment activity has grown $200 million since our last call, and we're currently in the process of closing $240 million of awarded deals, most of which will close in Q1 and early Q2.

Managed/Communities) investments, allowing them to fully enjoy the potential upside backed by the industry’s long-term trends while they hire an independent third-party operator to manage it for them, allowing them to turn from a simple landlord into a direct beneficiary of any jump in occupancy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The potential comes thanks to a significant boost expected from Baby Boomers aging combined with a very fragmented market that SBRA can take advantage of. Virtually every peer does this nowadays, although RIDEA (the legislation that allows REITs to go into a SHOP model) was passed back in 2007. The company also commented on its performance during their Q4 Earnings Call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Moving on to our operational results. They continue to be impressive. Our SHOP operational performance showed strong occupancy gains and increased cash NOI margins. Our same-store Senior Housing also showed occupancy gains and margin improvement. Our same-store Senior Housing triple- net showed improved occupancy and maintained high rent coverage. The skilled nursing portfolio again showed increased rent coverage, hitting an all-time high, as well as increased occupancy, and our top 10 triple-net relationships also had another strong showing. Our leverage stayed steady at our current target of 5x and the regulatory environment remains stable.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I believe it’s also important to be aware of the risks this shift comes with. Sure, they can capture massive upside swings in occupancy and “milk” significantly more from their assets than just rent, but that also means they are assuming the downside risk as well, with the pandemic, for example, likely being something that would’ve ruined many of these players.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I see it as a good move in the long term, this is quite a big shift from the triple-net lease model these companies were going for, which can go as far as resetting their shareholder base, as someone that bought them for the stability and yield may not be happy with taking the operational risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, this can be worsened by the ongoing nursing crisis, which can limit their expansion potential and the outcome of this SHOP pivot given the potential pressure on the margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, over the long term, population trends will very likely continue in a direction that can be very beneficial for LTC and the industry, while more and more REITs are switching to SHOP, allowing them to enjoy the potential rise in occupancy, while the market remains very fragmented, with potential supply issues given the potential hike in demand thanks to Baby Boomers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the day, we should keep in mind that SBRA will always depend on the environment it plays in since we’re talking about a REIT, with their expansion, tenants, clients, and even operations now depending on what’s going on in the broader economy, as that can affect their borrowing costs and the valuation of their assets/stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, I’ll reiterate that even though their transition to SHOP has great potential, it also brings a new layer of risk and volatility that may not be great for some of its older shareholders, exposing them even more to the environment, Medicaid and Medicare rates, politics, etc.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-1772111378150975_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"654\" data-height=\"298\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-1772111378150975_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sabra Health Care REIT IR SBRA stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best reit dividend stocks to buy 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-1772111378150975_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-1772111378150975_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-1772111378150975_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-1772111378150975_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

Across the rest of the portfolio, we expect continued strong direct revenue growth at Hinge, while Evergreen &amp; Emerging, or E&amp;E, and MG Asia continued to face headwinds. We are reinvesting savings from last year's workforce reductions and alternative payments initiative into Tinder and Hinge product and marketing to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Together, we expect this to result in relatively flat Match Group total revenue year-over-year in 2026 and adjusted EBITDA margins broadly in line with last year's, excluding the discrete items we've discussed.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTCH/sec-filings\">MTCH's latest report</a>, we continue to see a strong position, with current assets covering their current liabilities, while their debt schedule remains manageable and at a 3.2x gross leverage ratio, which is another advantage to keep in mind, as Match has access to issuing equity and debt at levels that are unrivaled by peers, which can allow them to keep acquiring competitors or invest much more aggressively in marketing or other turnaround initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using that strong FCF, the company returned roughly $788.8 million in buybacks and $186.26 million in dividends, repurchasing their shares outstanding by about 7% YoY on top of a ~2.5% dividend yield on today’s price, increasing the dividend by 5%, and remaining committed to returning meaningful capital through buybacks and dividends, so we could even expect low-double-digit combined yields in 2026 if they reach their guidance. Based on today’s price, last year’s returns would sum up to a ~13.4% combined yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Something important to understand is that Match ultimately relies on discretionary budgets, which exposes them to economic downturns. Right now, the consumer environment continues to be far from great, and that ultimately affects Match, as we’re talking about higher levels of stress, lower discretionary budgets, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/27/economy/us-consumer-confidence-january\" rel=\"nofollow\">weak confidence</a>, and trade-downs seen in virtually everything, which ultimately has an effect on the demand for Match’s platforms as well (at least the paid aspect), while Gen Z is already reportedly facing “dating app fatigue” that can push Match into lower ARPU or higher marketing spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s true that we’re talking about some <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">near-term improvements</a> recently that resulted in lower treasury yields as the market’s optimism around the economy is now reflected in that; things remain uncertain. This can push treasury yields higher or at least keep them at elevated levels despite what the Fed does, potentially pressuring businesses and especially the consumer for even longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the US economy <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/economy-grew-2-2-in-2025-beating-predictions/ar-AA1WJTlf\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing at 2.2% in 2025</a> and beating expectations, we’re still talking about the weakest level since 2016 (excluding the pandemic), while the market can easily face more shocks given the tariff situation, which is still ongoing despite the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/what-supreme-court-tariff-ruling-means-for-global-trade-us-economy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supreme Court’s decision</a>, while the recent economic plans in Japan could even lead to a selloff of treasuries and artificially inflate these yields. Meanwhile, although Match is a global business, there is potential to see issues in the US scale into issues for pretty much everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, I wouldn't underestimate the potential behind the timing of their “Tinder relaunch,” the expected event in the summer of 2026, and potential macro improvements that could work in the company’s favor, as we are still talking about an industry leader that's able to spend a lot on something that works well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-17720930340582087_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"837\" data-height=\"436\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-17720930340582087_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Match Group IR MTCH tinder stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best value stocks to buy 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-17720930340582087_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-17720930340582087_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-17720930340582087_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-17720930340582087_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Grand View Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, I believe the company’s operations remain very “future-proof” given the rising trends and expectations, with a <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-dating-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">CAGR of 7.4% from 2023 to 2030</a> globally and 6.7% in the US, which is not far from the mid-single-digit growth that Match is expecting during Tinder’s turnaround.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll also mention the possibility of the company expanding its sources of revenue through potential partnerships. For example, they can suggest local restaurants/locations that pay to get promoted for people who match each other, which is something that <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dating-just-got-easier-hinge-and-opentable-partner-to-help-daters-choose-the-perfect-date-spot-300937503.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hinge tested with OpenTable back in 2019</a>, but nothing really happened after that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I want to reiterate that there is little loyalty in this industry, as users can ultimately use more than just one app, generally chasing whatever is more popular at the time. It’s true that Match has been able to buy competitors and scale their core Tinder/Hinge, but any competitor can rise in this industry, as the competitive advantage here stands in brand popularity and size, while the entry barrier is very thin.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, Match will depend on discretionary budgets, which makes them susceptible to economic weakness and downturns, which can in turn result in more volatility, despite the company’s strong results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, even if their turnaround works - which in itself comes with risks - competition (current or future players) can still rise overnight thanks to going viral, trends, or a good campaign, as the moat ultimately stands mostly in their popularity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-177209303368735.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Match Group IR MTCH tinder stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best value stocks to buy 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-177209303368735.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-177209303368735.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-177209303368735.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60669497-177209303368735.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Calculations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Match’s DCF to Equity valuation, I’ll use their midpoint guidance of $1.11 billion in FCF in 2026, without accounting for net borrowing changes to highlight their pure cash flow generation potential (basically assuming that the current level of debt remains unchanged, which has roughly been the case <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTCH/balance-sheet#:~:text=%28%242.53%29-,Total%20Debt,-4%2C077.0\">since about 2020</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume a CAGR of only 4% until 2030, which is well below their 2026 FCF guidance and even above their buyback yield (which would improve the FCF/share significantly), <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTCH/earnings/estimates\">well below the market’s EPS and even the revenue estimates</a>, for example, potentially standing to benefit from Tinder’s/others’ turnaround, Hinge’s growth and an improving macro environment, followed by a 3.25% CAGR for the subsequent 5 years and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, with a 12.5% discount rate to assume a better margin of safety, using <a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2026/Match-Group-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results/#:~:text=Diluted%20shares%20outstanding-,254%2C087,-272%2C549\" rel=\"noopener\">254.09 million</a> diluted shares outstanding as of their Q4 report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This way, we get to an equity value of $11.86 billion, for an intrinsic value of $46.67 per share, which is significantly above the current $31.38 at the moment of writing this despite using conservative valuations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am upgrading MTCH to a Strong Buy given their valuation, as Tinder’s turnaround is advancing, they continue to make very solid cash flow, the yield is strong, and the company stands to benefit from macro improvements and trends.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are definitely risks to keep in mind given the “dating fatigue” trends, competition, exposure to the economy, or even AI, but the valuation, cash flows, yield, and potential are significantly outweighing these risks, in my opinion, and I placed an order to buy not long ago.</p>",

            "title": "Cinemark: Strongest Performer In A Weak Industry",
            "description": "<p data-eci=\"true\">As we prepare for the last weekend in February, I took a look at Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNK\" title=\"Cinemark Holdings, Inc.\">CNK</a></span>) after they <a href=\"https://ir.cinemark.com/sec-filings/annual-reports\" rel=\"nofollow\">released their earnings report</a> last week.</p> <h2>Author History</h2> <p>I have been following Cinemark for several years but never actually opened<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a position in it. My </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4318756-cinemark-a-buy-but-not-yet\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">first article on it</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was just as the COVID lockdown was starting; hard as it is to believe now, there were some who wanted to buy into Cinemark in early 2020, convinced that any theater closures would be short. I counseled against that, saying that both the short- and long-term prospects of the exhibitor industry were cloudy at best.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That was good advice; Cinemark is actually down since my first article, even as the market has doubled over the same time frame. I did miss a chance to buy in later that year, when COVID was at its peak. Cinemark bottomed at $9 per share and is now trading at $27. A missed opportunity, perhaps, but before vaccines became available, it wasn’t entirely clear when life would be returning to normal. Altogether, I am not too dissatisfied with how I’ve played—or not played, really—this stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Early Box Office Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are individual operational characteristics that vary between the three major players in the theater space—Cinemark, AMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMC\" title=\"AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.\">AMC</a>), and Regal—hands down the single biggest factor in profitability is simply the health of the overall box office. The picture here is mixed, much as it has been for years since COVID. While January represented a <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/month/january/2026/?ref_=bo_ml_table_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">substantial outperformance of the year prior</a>, that owed almost entirely to a single film, Disney’s third <em>Avatar</em> entry, which two months into the year is still the only film to crack $100 million domestic - despite the fact that <em>Avatar </em>actually opened in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Disney’s <em>Avatar</em> franchise is always somewhat of a slant factor in the box office analysis. Because <em>Avatar </em>films always launch in December, they are spread across two years; the year it launches is back-end weighted, and the following year, which catches the tail end of the boost from the film, is front-year weighted. Were <em>Avatar</em> to be a more normal film and to have posted the same numbers in January as the second-best film (<em>Zootopia 2</em>, another top performer from last year, so hardly a slouch), veritably all of January’s Y/Y growth would vanish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/month/february/2026/?grossesOption=calendarGrosses\" rel=\"nofollow\">picture is a little better in February</a>, where <em>Wuthering Heights</em> mild <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874026-warner-bros-discovery-merger-how-to-play-three-scenarios\">underperformance relative to expectations</a> means it’s not inconceivable the wait for a proper 2026 $100 million entry could go on a little longer. Even if <em>Heights</em> does make it, growth will be difficult to come by; February will probably finish in the red Y/Y. Altogether, we will probably go into March up less than a percentage point Y/Y YTD.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential Box Office Upside In 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No on will be surprise by this who has followed theaters in the post-COVID era. It’s been the same story with a different cheer every year. “We just need to push through to 2022.” No, that didn’t work? Well, no matter, we’ll “tee off in ’23.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No, no, no, that’s not it; movies will “soar in ’24.” <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2024/?ref_=bo_yl_table_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Since they didn’t, though</a>, what’s important now is to “survive till ’25.” And since <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2025/?ref_=bo_yl_table_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">we all know how well that went</a>, the problem is supposed to be “fixed in ’26.” Though, since that plan isn’t off to a good start, the whispers about “revvin in ’27” are probably already being trotted out for testing somewhere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the record, as someone who has been a perpetual skeptic about all these post-COVID rebound theories, I’m actually going to go against type and say I’m not quite ready to write off the idea yet that 2026 might actually be the year that finally takes the box office over $10 billion. Shocking, coming from me, I know. But there’s enough meat on the bone to keep the industry in contention until December, when the launch of Disney’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>will probably decide the issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other heavy lifter this year will be <em>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</em>, the one Marvel property that hasn’t really seen any sort of real decline since COVID and the exit of Robert Downey Jr., which sent the franchise into a bit of a tailspin. If you think that’s too strong, I refer you to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808582-disney-amidst-exaggerated-movie-woes-is-stock-preparing-to-sell-espn\">this analysis of Marvel’s performance</a> I wrote last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I’ve also said <em>Spider-Man </em>seems to be the exception, and my research suggests a $2 billion global cume is not out of the question. The real question will be whether <em>Avengers</em> plays like <em>Endgame</em> did or like Marvel’s more recent iterations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operational Trends</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cinemark has tried to counteract this steady box-office malaise by increasing sales of concessions. <a href=\"https://ir.cinemark.com/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0001193125-26-056015/0001193125-26-056015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earnings announced last week</a> showed that Cinemark is now growing concessions revenue faster than admissions revenue, not just in percentage terms but in absolute numbers as well. In fact, Cinemark admissions revenue was actually <em>lower</em> than it was two years ago. Concessions revenue is now more than 80% of admissions, quite a remarkable turnaround from pre-COVID, when it was usually more like 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the growth, Cinemark's operating income declined. The primary culprit was the fact that while admissions revenue is down compared to two years ago, “rental costs”—the box office money paid to film producers—actually <em>rose</em>, putting pressure on film gross margins. This reflects something I have long worried about with theaters: the shift towards franchises and away from original films increases the bargaining power of producers and reduces the leverage of exhibitors, who have a smaller pool of films to show, and veritably all of which become “must-have.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have outlined before why I consider exhibitors failure to make any changes to the cross-subsidy scheme in theaters to be a bearish indicator. I won’t repeat all of that again; those who are interested can read the relevant information in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4498213-amc-entertainment-up-50-percent-in-a-month-is-there-more-upside\">my previous article</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The general and administrative category also showed outsized cost growth. Altogether, Cinemark reported an almost 10% drop in operating income for 2025 Y/Y despite growing revenues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Subscriptions Have Potential, But Unexploited</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My prior cautious optimism on Cinemark was based in substantial part on the potential of their new subscription service to alter the long-term dynamics governing the industry and allow them to break out of the debilitating cycle of franchise films over originals that is ossifying the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Six years later, Movie Club isn’t a failure—Cinemark reported that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871486-cinemark-holdings-inc-cnk-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">30% of all sales are now Movie Club members</a>—but nor has the company really leaned into it enough to substantially alter its prospects. While I still think Movie Club could be a significant factor in restoring Cinemark’s long-term profit potential, I no longer have confidence management has any intention to make a major push in this area.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long-Term Industry Recession</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are also long-term risks. For one thing, the news today that Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558365-paramount-wins-the-bidding-war-for-warner-bros-as-netflix-walks-away\">will purchase</a> Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>) instead of Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) is probably a net negative for theaters. While many theater owners feared that Netflix would pull Warner’s entire film slate out of the theater system, Netflix management had been <a href=\"https://puck.news/ted-sarandos-case-for-warners-netflix-ceo-on-16-billion-synergies-claim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mounting a major charm offensive</a> to convince them it had no intentions of doing so, and there was always the chance they meant it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, Paramount likely won’t put Warner’s movies on streaming or in theaters; it simply won’t make them. Or, more accurately, it will stop making Paramount movies and focus exclusively on Warner once it owns it, which, to theaters already desperately short of volume, comes to much the same thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That has been the pattern of past mergers; Disney is going to <a href=\"https://boardwalktimes.net/most-anticipated-disney-films-of-2026-3e9f79180a6e\" rel=\"nofollow\">release roughly a dozen films this year</a> in theaters, barely exceeding <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2018/distributor/Walt-Disney\" rel=\"nofollow\">the total it released in 2018</a>. Almost the entire Fox studio output from that year is now simply gone from the system. That number too may shrink in future years; I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854815-disney-can-the-mouse-house-bring-back-the-movie-magic\">wrote just a few short months ago</a> that the <em>Avatar</em> franchise would surely go the full five-film distance. Less than a month later, <em>Avatar 3</em> came in a staggering <em>$1 billion short of projections.</em><strong> </strong>A Disney abort cannot be ruled out now, which would sunset one of the biggest franchises left in theaters.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cinemark may well end up performing better than expected this year if, in fact, this is the year that we finally get back over $10 billion domestic. That is somewhat on the optimistic side, however, and even if it did, it would not alter the long-term trends, which I believe are what is really holding the stock down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I sound like a bit of a broken record, but my view hasn’t changed; Cinemark will probably perform better than other theater stocks, but not as well as other industries. I rate CNK stock a Hold only and will not be opening a position.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"getty-figure\" data-type=\"getty-image\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w630\" alt=\"Exterior of Cinemark Paradise 24 movie theater with Egyptian theme - Davie, Florida, USA\" data-id=\"1153688000\" data-type=\"getty-image\" width=\"3898\" height=\"2554\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1153688000/image_1153688000.jpg?io=getty-c-w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 132px), (max-width: 1199px) calc(100vw - 666px), (max-width: 1307px) calc(100vw - 708px), 600px\" fetchpriority=\"high\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p> <p class=\"item-credits\">Holly Guerrio/iStock Editorial via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"inline_ad_placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div>",

NGN-401 is currently being evaluated in the Embolden™ registrational clinical trial, with completion of dosing expected in the second quarter of 2026.</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Neurogene Overview - Updates &amp; Analysis From My Last Note</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last time I covered Neurogene, a New York rare disease/gene therapy specialist drug developer, in a note for Seeking Alpha, it was March 2024, and I awarded the stock a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680543-neurogene-stock-gene-therapy-specialist-may-break-chain-of-failed-mergers\">Hold rating</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares traded at $49.5 at that time, having gained &gt;250% since Neurogene listed on the Nasdaq via a merger with Neoleukin Therapeutics (more detail in my last post), but they have since lost ~50% of their value, trading at $25 today. Market cap valuation today is ~$400m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last post I discussed Neurogene's EXACT technology platform for precise transgene expression - for an in-depth discussion of the platform and its merits, see my last post - and its two clinical candidates, NGN-401, indicated for Rett Syndrome, and NGN-101 for the ultra-rare CLN5 Batten Disease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Neurogene stock actually reached a high of nearly $70 per share in early November 2024, the company was then hit by a double dose of bad news.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, Neurogene<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241118334218/en/Neurogene-Provides-Update-on-NGN-401-Gene-Therapy-Clinical-Trial-for-Rett-Syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\"> revealed</a> it had stopped the higher dose cohort of its Phase 1/2 open label clinical trial of NGN-401, after a patient who had received the dose became critically ill with a severe hyperinflammatory condition called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (\"HLH\") (the patient later <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/neurogene-details-severe-aav-reaction-led-young-patients-death-rett-syndrome-gene-therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">died</a>), although the FDA permitted the lower-dose cohort to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/neurogene-stops-batten-gene-therapy-after-fda-denies-request-dealing-double-dose-bad-news\" rel=\"noopener\">rejected</a> Neurogene's Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (\"RMAT\") application for candidate NGN-101, leading the company to make a decision to stop developing its second pipeline asset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By mid-November, Neurogene stock traded ~$20 per share, and amid a <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/talking-brick-wall-senate-hearing-takes-aim-fdas-rare-disease-review-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">backdrop</a> of controversy at the FDA with regard to gene therapy development, have struggled to gain much momentum since.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In May 2025 Seeking Alpha<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4449647-neurogene-downgraded-to-neutral-at-baird-on-regulatory-uncertainty\"> reported</a> that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p></p> <ul> <li>Neurogene (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NGNE\" title=\"Neurogene Inc.\">NGNE</a>) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Baird, citing increasing regulatory uncertainty and a higher approval bar at the FDA under new leadership.</li> <li>The downgrade comes at a time when Neurogene (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NGNE\" title=\"Neurogene Inc.\">NGNE</a>) plans to provide an update on a registrational trial plan for its gene therapy NGN-401 targeted at a rare neurological disorder called Rett syndrome during H1 2025.</li> <li>The analysts at Baird said that despite the stock's rebound since April, they believe the FDA's bar for approval is indeed moving higher, as former head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Peter Marks, has been replaced by a far more data-driven Vinay Prasad.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In October last year Neurogene <a href=\"https://ir.neurogene.com/news-releases/news-release-details/neurogene-announces-positive-regulatory-update-ngn-401-gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">shared</a> a \"positive regulatory update\", announcing it:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>has completed discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on its Embolden™ registrational trial protocol and plans to initiate dosing in the fourth quarter of 2025. In response to strong interest from the Rett syndrome community, the trial is expected to enroll across 13 sites.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The news triggered a (brief) spike in the pharma's share price, to ~$35 per share, although these gains were seemingly wiped out when Neurogene shared updated interim clinical data in the pediatric cohort (ages 4-10 cohort) of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of females with Rett Syndrome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The website <a href=\"https://reverserett.org/about-rett-syndrome/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23508201090&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoNClu3OHvDrWilQVMVQOGEsLrmZX&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAnoXNBhAZEiwAnItcGz5_w_AxZPfwm0VllIDwEEd22ILEFgwwp621MzV8HwHdZSLDxfDQFBoC3vQQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow\">reverserett.org</a> shares the following description of Rett Syndrome:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Rett syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that is diagnosed primarily in girls and begins to manifest during the toddler years. After a seemingly normal first year the child begins to regress with developmental milestones.</p> <p>This regression can happen quickly over a number of days or very gradually over months. Often the first noticeable symptoms include: low muscle tone (hypotonia), eye crossing, decreased interactions with people or surroundings, and loss of hand function. The hallmark symptom of Rett is repetitive hand movements and wringing that can be constant, especially in younger children.</p> <p>As time passes additional symptoms may include: loss of speech, trouble with balance and motor coordination, irritability and crying, and disrupted sleep patterns. Many also develop seizures, anxiety, breathing problems, gastrointestinal issues, orthopedic complications, as well as oral motor difficulties.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Neurogene disclosed that from a safety perspective:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>All treatment-related adverse events have been mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity and the majority are known potential risks of AAV and have resolved or are resolving</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And from an efficacy perspective, that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>All pediatric participants experienced functional gains across the spectrum of disease severity, with an aggregate 35 developmental milestones/skills gained across core clinical domains of Rett syndrome – hand function/fine motor, language/communication and ambulation/gross motor</p> <ul><li>All developmental milestones/skills gained have been durable, with multidomain improvements observed in key domains</li></ul> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It seems odd with hindsight that shares lost value after this update, as it seems to have been the basis for the FDA's award of its Breakthrough Therapy Designation - nevertheless, Neurogene has also achieved alignment with the FDA on a \"single registrational trial to support BLA submission\", its Embolden study, which is already underway.

Neurogene seems to have reported a successful outcome from negotiations with the FDA for its gene therapy. Could the pharma be being rewarded for what the FDA perceives is a superior study design, or a more effective drug?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, one of the difficulties when conducting clinical studies into neurological diseases such as Rett Syndrome, or Huntington's, is measuring efficacy. Unless you are a patient's caregiver, recognizing signs of deterioration or improvement cannot be easy, and while scoring systems have been developed, it has to be said some gene therapies have been approved on slight evidence of efficacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I noted in my last post on Neurogene:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>At least three gene therapies have been approved in the US by the Food and Drug Agency (\"FDA\") using a similar delivery mechanism (to Neurogene's, an AAV vector) - Swiss Pharma giant Novartis' (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>) Zolgensma, indicated for spinal muscular atrophy (\"SMA\"), BioMarin's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMRN\" title=\"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.\">BMRN</a>) hemophilia gene therapy roctavian, and Sarepta Therapeutics' (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRPT\" title=\"Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.\">SRPT</a>) Elevidys, indicated for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (\"DMD\").</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On February 24th - a few days ago - it was<a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biomarin-officially-pulls-plug-hemophilia-gene-therapy-roctavian-taking-119m-write-after\" rel=\"nofollow\"> reported t</a>hat Biomarin would pull Roctavian off the market, due to a lack of commercial uptake. Last year, Sarepta's gene therapy Elevidys was briefly withdrawn from the market after <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1548\" rel=\"nofollow\">patient deaths</a> were reported. The drug actually failed to meet the primary endpoint in its pivotal phase 3 Embark study, but was still granted approval. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, then, we might conclude it has been a difficult year for the field of gene therapies, and that stricter approval criteria may not be such a bad idea, but there is of course the alternative argument that patients are in desperate need of better therapies, and any sign of efficacy - however faint, marks a significant step forward, and that drugs displaying such efficacy should be made available to the public as quickly as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It seems as though Neurogene has the FDA's support over its pivotal study design, but by no means does that guarantee that the study will be a successful one - sterner tests lie ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We must also consider the financials of Neurogene. The company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20307555-neurogene-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-highlights-recent-updates#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">reported</a> cash and equivalents of $71m, plus $194m of short-term investments as of the end of Q3, with total liabilities of just $22m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nine month net loss amounted to $(65.6m), and Neurogene says (in its latest corporate presentation) that its cash is expected to last into 2028 and is \"expected to fund operations through Embolden data readout, BLA submission and key pre-launch activities\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49171940-17722182955691018_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1257\" data-height=\"627\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49171940-17722182955691018_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49171940-17722182955691018_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49171940-17722182955691018_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49171940-17722182955691018_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49171940-17722182955691018_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Neurogene upcoming catalysts <span>(presentation )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see above, Neurogene does have some intriguing catalysts upcoming for 2026, including a key data readout in mid-2026, and its share price has finally discovered some upside momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That may be enough to make the bull case in some readers eyes - the bear case would be based on a data failure or safety issue, which could see NGN-401 shelved altogether, leaving the business with no clinical stage assets, in which case investors would likely suffer heavy losses.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Frankly, given the current environment, I would urge extreme caution when investing in any gene therapy stock at this time, so I am issuing a second straight Hold recommendation, but remain hopeful that Neurogene might deliver a study win this year to revive a sector that is enduring a troubled time presently.</p>",
