Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest dip in more than a decade.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, IDC said that manufacturers shipped <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/press-releases/q425mobilephonetop5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.26 billion devices in 2025</a>. The firm predicts that the volume will dip to only 1.12 billion this year. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping long‑term TAM (Total Addressable Market), the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, said in a statement. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097553\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"680\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=50,50 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: IDC</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Popal said that because of memory shortage, the average selling price of a smartphone is supposed to rise by 14%. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points.

Now, AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture <a href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2026/accenture-and-mistral-ai-accelerate-enterprise-reinvention-with-scalable-ai-that-delivers-strategic-autonomy-for-customers\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced a multi-year partnership</a>. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/anthropic-and-accenture-sign-multi-year-ai-strategic-partnership/\">deals with Accenture</a>, as well.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/openai-calls-in-the-consultants-for-its-enterprise-push/\">“Frontier Alliance”</a> initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI Frontier</a> AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-and-ibm-announce-strategic-partnership/\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/deloitte-goes-all-in-on-ai-despite-having-to-issue-a-hefty-refund-for-use-of-ai/\">Deloitte</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out.</p>\n</div>",

If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ada can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada , can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIeqR_VpeH8?feature=oembed\" title=\"Meet Ada: Your Digital Twin\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (Model Context Protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which has raised over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\">$81 million in funding</a>, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched <a href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/read-ai-launches-search-copilot-an-industry-first-ai-tool-for-cross-platform-search-and-discovery--at-no-cost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Search Copilot</a> for knowledge discovery for users, and last month, it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send a custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based <a href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/search-copilot-actions-building-workflows-that-work-for-you\" rel=\"nofollow\">on internal and web knowledge</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ai-note-taking-app-granola-adds-a-repeatable-prompts-feature/\">“recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts</a> to surface knowledge from meeting data. <a href=\"https://www.quillmeetings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quill</a>, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Self-driving truck startup Einride raises $113M PIPE ahead of public debut",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.einride.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Einride</a> has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-plans-to-go-public-via-a-spac/\">public debut</a> that’s expected for the first half of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Swedish startup is most well-known for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">building both electric trucks and autonomous pods</a> that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States, and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">$100 million previously announced</a> crossover financing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses. Though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/\">public via a SPAC merger</a> valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/techcrunch-mobility-self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-goes-public-and-a-shake-up-at-hyundais-supernal/\">SPAC road</a> to the public market in 2025.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Walmart has <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2026/02/walmart-agrees-100-mil[…]ettle-ftc-states-charges-over-deceptive-earnings-claims-related\" rel=\"nofollow\">agreed to pay $100 million</a> to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over deceptive pay practices within its Spark Driver service, which uses gig workers to deliver online orders from local stores to customers. The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its original <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/WalmartSparkDriverComplaint.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">complaint</a>, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark driver earnings. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Walmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers, as well.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "title": "Bumble adds AI-powered photo feedback and profile guidance tools",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Bumble <a href=\"https://ir.bumble.com/news/news-details/2026/Bumble-Announces-Two-New-Features-For-Confidence-and-Clarity-in-Dating-2026-36eaJ_omGR/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> on Thursday that it’s adding a series of AI-driven features intended to help turn matches into lasting connections, including those that offer feedback and guidance on users’ bios, photos, and prompts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dating app’s new AI-suggested profile guidance tool will roll out globally and give “personalized, actionable feedback” on users’ bios and prompts. For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend ten years ago, but it’s still new information to many users. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/tinder-looks-to-ai-to-help-fight-swipe-fatigue-and-dating-app-burnout/\">Chemistry</a>, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/\">asks to use its AI on your camera roll</a> that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/well/dating-irl-analog-online.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">real-world experiences</a> that are not intermediated by an app.</p>\n</div>",

The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, warned in <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2026/Feb/25/2003880301/-1/-1/0/CSA_Exploitation_of_SD-WAN_Appliances.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">an alert</a> that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-26-03-mitigate-vulnerabilities-cisco-sd-wan-systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">imminent threat</a> and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/us-cybersecurity-agency-cisa-reportedly-in-dire-shape-amid-trump-cuts-and-layoffs/\">currently running at reduced capacity</a> due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, Cisco warned of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/cisco-says-chinese-hackers-are-exploiting-its-customers-with-a-new-zero-day/\">similarly-rated 10.0 vulnerability</a> in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks.</p>\n</div>",

All told, the project has over 50 donors so far. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder, <a href=\"https://kvinogradov.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Konstantin Vinogradov</a>, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open-source, AI and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov says as he scoured the world for open-source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open-source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open-source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cash-strapped-burned-out\">Cash strapped, burned out</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open-source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open-source developers <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">are not paid for their work.</a> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Foundation-2025-Report\" rel=\"nofollow\">$300 million last year</a> largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation</a>. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/with-ai-investor-loyalty-is-almost-dead-at-least-a-dozen-openai-vcs-now-also-back-anthropic/\">itself raised $30 billion this month</a>. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/open_source_to_closed_doors/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Register reported.</a>  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open-source projects forever.</p>\n</div>",
