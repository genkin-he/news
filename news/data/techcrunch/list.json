The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the post does not mention any plans to invoke the Defense Production Act or designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk.

            "title": "Musk bashes OpenAI in deposition, saying ‘nobody committed suicide because of Grok’",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety.  He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comment came up in a line of questioning about a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/1100-notable-signatories-just-signed-an-open-letter-asking-all-ai-labs-to-immediately-pause-for-at-least-6-months/\">public letter</a> Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a <a href=\"https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-tech-justice-law-project-lawsuits-accuse-chatgpt-of-emotional-manipulation-supercharging-ai-delusions-and-acting-as-a-suicide-coach/\" rel=\"nofollow\">series of lawsuits</a> alleging that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics</a> have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/elon-musk-openai-sam-altman-court/\">lawsuit</a> against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\">Musk claims violated</a> its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own, however. Last month, Musk’s social network X was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">flooded with non-consensual nude images</a> generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">were said to be of minors</a>. This led the California Attorney General’s office to <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">open an investigation</a> into the matter. The EU is also <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/musks-grok-chatbot-faces-eu-privacy-investigation-over-sexualized-deepfake-images\" rel=\"nofollow\">running its own investigation</a>, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted to — AI safety to be prioritized.” …</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?w=500\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" style=\"width:370px;height:auto\" width=\"500\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>imgflip</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI —  the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/\">supposed $100 million donation</a> to OpenAI; the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/170/musk-v-altman/\" rel=\"nofollow\">second amended complaint</a> in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The past two weeks have been defined by a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">clash</a> between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/\">Amodei publicly signaled</a> that Anthropic isn’t backing down – despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-anthropic-worried-about\"><strong>What is Anthropic worried about?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no human in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons.The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a <a href=\"https://www.esd.whs.mil/portals/54/documents/dd/issuances/dodd/300009p.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023 DOD directive</a>, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as ‘lawful use.’</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high stakes calls.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-the-pentagon-want\"><strong>What does the Pentagon want?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thursday X post</a> that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Anthropic has until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the Department’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times  seemed connected to cultural grievance. In <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4377190/remarks-by-secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-at-spacex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January</a>, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-now\"><strong>So what now?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01pm on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DOD, it could be a national security issue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second- or third-best.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2027294561467613256\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elon Musk’s rhetoric </a>on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DOD total control over its technology. Recent <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/\">settled its lawsuit</a> and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">How Was I Supposed to Know</a>” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$3 million</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many musicians have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/nicki-minaj-billie-eilish-katy-perry-and-other-musicians-sign-letter-against-irresponsible-ai/\">spoken out</a> against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

For the first time, F1 fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the live race simultaneously on both Apple TV and Netflix. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix subscribers will be able to stream the full race weekend — including practice, qualifying, and the Grand Prix itself on May 24 — live on the platform.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Beyond live race coverage, the partnership includes cross-promotion of Netflix’s hit series, “Drive to Survive.” For the first time, the eighth season — which consists of eight episodes covering the 2025 Formula One World Championship — will be available to both Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. and Netflix users globally, significantly broadening its audience. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Season 8 premieres today, on February 27. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">F1’s rise in American culture extends beyond television at this point — Brad Pitt’s F1 film is nominated for Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. “Drive to Survive” has successfully <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4402239/2023/04/13/f1-formula-one-drive-to-survive-ratings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">attracted a diverse audience</a> for its behind-the-scenes approach, transforming it from a typical sports docuseries into a compelling narrative that’s brought in millions of new fans. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The series has been a particular focus of Apple’s broader F1 ambitions: the company has said it plans to promote the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps (highlighting F1 tracks around the world), Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as in its physical retail stores.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This collaboration also means Netflix continues to push into live sports broadcasting, after pivoting from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/25/netflix-is-not-yet-considering-live-sports-but-heres-why-it-should/\">“no-sports” stance</a> to securing major rights for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/netflix-adds-more-live-tv-to-its-lineup/\">NFL Christmas games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-raw-netflix-release-date-news\" rel=\"nofollow\">WWE Raw</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/mlb-netflix-opening-day-home-run-derby-field-of-dreams\" rel=\"nofollow\">MLB</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Fans have also honed in on a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-winds-waves-cloud-legendary-gyarados-theories-trailer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">suspicious-looking cloud</a> in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly ten years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"bluesky-embed\" data-bluesky-cid=\"bafyreie3rgahsrfq6o2jgmgzjiayu7h27gdpj2jcsyatghr2mlcyn3lnle\" data-bluesky-uri=\"at://did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/app.bsky.feed.post/3mftx5zaug22f\"><p lang=\"pt\">pokémon white lotus</p>— <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y?ref_src=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">stanley tucci da grande sp (@fullofentulho.bsky.social)</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/post/3mftx5zaug22f?ref_src=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">2026-02-27T14:44:57.713Z</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script\" src=\"https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Main series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region… but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/\">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>” came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the “Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen” games today for the Switch… but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/\">extremely easy and legally dubious</a> way to get those games on your phone for free. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Hkq2C4Wr9rhr0OV9hOfNI4oA4y?domain=perplexity.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">example workflows</a> on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097675\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg 3799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1200,621 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1280,663 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=430,223 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=720,373 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=900,466 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=800,414 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1536,795 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=2048,1060 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=668,346 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1192,617 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=708,367 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.</p>\n</div>",

But as the Pentagon’s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friday afternoon deadline</a> for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, over 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed <a href=\"https://notdivided.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an open letter</a> urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-ai-policy-war-spying.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">confirmed</a> that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Agreed.
