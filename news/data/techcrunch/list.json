            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Lidar-maker Luminar is warning shareholders that it will run out of cash in early 2026 and has announced a 25% cut to its workforce to help staunch the bleeding — its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/luminar-kicks-off-another-round-of-layoffs-amid-ceos-sudden-resignation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">second layoff</a> of the year — according to a Friday regulatory <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000175805725000006/lazr-20251030.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">filing</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not immediately clear how many workers will be affected. Luminar started the year with around 580 employees, but the company did not specify the size of the layoff earlier this year. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced its chief financial officer, Thomas Fennimore, is stepping down on November 13 “to pursue other career opportunities.” Luminar said Fennimore’s departure is “not the result of any disagreement” about its finances or with the company’s auditors.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all comes as founder Austin Russell — who was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/billionaire-founder-of-luminar-replaced-as-ceo-following-ethics-inquiry/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">replaced</a> as CEO in May following an unspecified ethics inquiry by the board of directors’ audit committee — is in the middle of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an effort to buy the company</a>. That buyout was encouraged by at least some of the board members, as TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has struggled in part because it has sold fewer lidar sensors to Volvo, which was supposed to be a major customer. In August, Fennimore said Luminar was therefore <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000175805725000006/lazr-20251030.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">selling the sensors at a lower cost</a> than it takes to build them. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar said Friday that it has $72 million of cash and marketable securities as of October 24. Without any additional fundraising, the current burn rate means Luminar could run out of money as early as the first quarter of next year, or breach the terms of certain loan agreements. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Luminar revealed it had already skipped required quarterly interest payments on certain loans that were due October 15. Those lenders have agreed to give Luminar until November 6 to make the payments before taking any action.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar is not due to report its third-quarter financial results for another two weeks, but on Friday, it revealed it expects to report around $18 million of revenue and debt of $429 million.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://adam.new/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam</a>, one of the most viral startups in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch, has raised a $4.1 million seed round to power its next steps, TechCrunch learned exclusively.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After generating over 10 million social media impressions with the launch of its text-to-3D model app, the AI startup had its pick of investors. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were getting term sheets over email without any meetings,” said CEO Zach Dive (on the right of the picture).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adam quickly went with <a href=\"https://tq.vc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TQ Ventures</a> as its lead investor because they agreed on the future of computer-aided design (CAD). Just as importantly, they also agreed on Adam’s roadmap — going consumer first, and then to enterprise.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This required the most alignment: Adam caught people’s attention with a mainstream product, not an enterprise one. But Dive said this choice is paying off, and paving the way for Adam’s upcoming copilot for professional-grade CAD workflows.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup had always planned to go B2B, but felt that the technology wasn’t enterprise-ready yet — which is why it initially focused on makers, not engineers. But AI models improved faster than they expected, and Adam now plans to launch its copilot by the end of the year, Dive said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its initial tool lets creators without CAD skills create 3D models from text prompts, but early feedback showed that text wasn’t always the best way to interact with 3D, Dive said. “So for our copilot, we blended in different interaction paradigms; for example, users selecting different parts of the 3D object and conversing with it.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This will give the startup an element of differentiation compared to <a href=\"http://xometry.pro/en/articles/text-to-cad-tools-test/\" rel=\"nofollow\">other text-to-CAD products</a>, although there is already competition in the ‘AI copilot for CAD’ segment as well. <a href=\"https://mecagent.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MecAgent</a>, for instance, is already available, but Adam could capitalize on its viral launch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early momentum particularly helped with hiring, which is still an ongoing effort, Dive said. He and his cofounder, Adam CPO Aaron Li, both graduated from UC Berkeley’s Master of Design program, but the startup also needs more AI and engineering talent to “give models the right context for reasoning in space.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Capital and endorsements can both help with this endeavor, and Adam now has its fair share of both, sometimes combined. Besides TQ and participating funds 468 Capital, Pioneer, Script Capital, and Transpose Platform, Adam is also backed by angel investors, including Tim Glaser (Posthog), Trevor Blackwell (YC), and Theo Browne (T3 Chat).</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch called Adam “the v0 of CAD” (in a nod to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/vercel-debuts-an-ai-model-optimized-for-web-development/\">Vercel’s V0</a>, an AI-powered platform for web creation). </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s simpler, faster, and reaches a broader audience,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/rauchg/status/1884669642888929351\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote on X</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adam is already on its way to reaching a broad audience, with “tens of thousands of individual users and a growing base of paying customers” for its standard and pro plans, which respectively start at $5.99 and $17.99 per month. The startup hasn’t begun to monetize its soon-to-launch enterprise offering, but has “testers validating different features,” Dive said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This testing phase is clearly necessary: there’s quite a jump from helping amateurs print 3D Pikachus to supporting engineers in their daily work. Dive said the startup doesn’t intend to replace them, but instead streamlines time-consuming tasks such as applying the same change to multiple CAD files.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With an initial focus on mechanical engineering, the startup plans to help these pro users generate feature‑rich parametric designs in popular CAD programs, beginning with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/24/onshape-raises-80-million-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/\">Onshape</a>, which is known for bringing CAD to the cloud and reshaping workflows. “The same thing will be true with AI,” Dive predicted.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said AI chatbots aren’t a major traffic driver for the social platform despite companies like OpenAI and Google having seen progress in people using AI for search. During Reddit’s Q3 2025 call, the exec noted that Google search and direct access continue to be its top traffic drivers. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Chatbots are] not a traffic driver today. I think our relationships with the companies that we work for — or work with directly are healthy, and we both learned a lot over the last couple of years, really the value of Reddit’s data and where our respective products can go and how we can help each other. So I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners. But they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Huffman said during the call with analysts.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An analyst asked the company if 50% of the traffic comes from Google and 50% direct, Huffman said that those numbers are “approximate, but pretty close.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit has had a tricky relationship with LLM builders. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/reddit-locks-down-its-public-data-in-new-content-policy-says-use-now-requires-a-contract/\">locked down its data through a new policy change in May 2024</a> and indicated that any kind of commercial use of its data would need a license. At the same time, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/openai-inks-deal-to-train-ai-on-reddit-data/\">signed a deal with OpenAI</a> to let it use Reddit data for model training. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/reddit-is-said-to-sign-ai-content-licensing-deal-ahead-of-ipo\" rel=\"nofollow\">a partnership agreement with Google</a>. On the other hand, the company has ensued a legal battle with AI companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/reddit-sues-anthropic-for-allegedly-not-paying-for-training-data/\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/reddit-sues-perplexity-scraping-data-train-ai-system-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perplexity</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit reported a positive quarter with $585 million in revenue, up 68% year-on-year. The company also clocked in 116 million daily active unique users and 444 million weekly active unique users, with 20% growth year-over-year. The company mentioned it recorded 31% year-on-year growth in international daily users. It also said that more than 190 million Americans visit the social network every week.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company mentioned that it continues to invest in making the search experience a central part of the experience. Huffman said that the company is handling 20% of search volumes through its AI-powered Answers and “that kind of core search box.” He noted that in Q3, 75 million people searched weekly on Reddit. The company has been talking about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/reddit-plans-to-unify-its-search-interface-as-it-looks-to-become-a-search-engine/\">unifying AI and the core search experience</a>, and Huffman said it is coming in the next few quarters.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, Reddit is experimenting with a new and simpler onboarding flow to increase early user engagement.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want them to see in their first session that Reddit is amazing and has content for them. So our goal is to connect users with relevant content very quickly,” Huffman said.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Navan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was the first to use a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/shutdown-silver-lining-your-ipo-review-comes-after-investors-buy-in/\">new SEC rule</a> that allows public listings during a government shutdown.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the updated mechanism carries a risk: the government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stock’s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market’s reaction to Navan’s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they’re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Navan’s expense management solution helps companies manage employees expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639723/000162828025044812/navan-sx1a.htm#ifa73afad53404c2198f451f1c96a9518_669\" rel=\"nofollow\">its S1</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Navan’s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).</p>\n</div>",

The company also introduced new product forms, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to create with its coding tool for sheets to make widgets for getting repeatable insights.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its elements, that would generate designs with editable layers and objects as compared to a flat image. It said the model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’ve found is that where people want to be is the ability to really marry this idea of starting with a prompt and getting far, but also being able to iterate directly themselves.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-infusing-more-ai-features-into-canva\">Infusing more AI features into Canva</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canva-is-adding-an-ai-assistant-coding-and-sheets-to-its-platform/\">a chat-like interface for generating new media</a> items using prompts earlier this year.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.bevel.health/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bevel</a>, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old healthtech company. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. The company also adds that the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days, rare numbers in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with numerous health companion brands, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/whoop-opens-its-blood-testing-service-to-350000-on-wait-list/\">Whoop</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/smart-ring-maker-oura-raises-900m-from-fidelity/\">Oura</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/19/eight-sleep-grabs-100m-to-bring-ai-into-your-bed/\">Eight Sleep</a>, why does the world need another one?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to co-founder and CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaagarwal3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aditya Agarwal</a>, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area such as steps, sleep, or nutrition, Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which helps analyze key information and adapt recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063834\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1200,600 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1280,640 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=900,450 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1234,617 1234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bevel</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bevel’s story started with pain—literally.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises. The demanding nature of startup life meant Nguyen took little care of his health, developing chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burnt out. What helped was logging his data manually, through spreadsheets and connected trackers, to rebuild his energy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he connected with Ben and Grey about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With fresh capital and no plans to venture into wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand horizontally into more services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app. We’re excited to support this team as they build the future of personal health.”</p>\n</div>",

These join other options like Verified, Quotes, Reposts, and more as other ways to filter replies. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3064000\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"680\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png 3158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Activity-Feed-Filtering.png?resize=50,50 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta / Threads</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/251029/p56#a251029p56\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> during its third-quarter earnings call this week that Threads has now reached 150 million daily active users, up from over 100 million in December 2024.
