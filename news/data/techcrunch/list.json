More than 30 employees participated at the same valuation, he said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/eternal-ceo-deepinder-goyal-hands-over-reins-to-blinkit-chief-as-quick-commerce-takes-off/\">handing the role to</a> Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Temple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xik34jh-doc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple <a href=\"https://x.com/deepigoyal/status/2027256222660133375\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">aims to build</a> what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain–computer interface engineering.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We're recruiting at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/temple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">@temple</a>.<br/><br/>At Temple, we are building the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes. A device that measures what no other wearable in the world measures, with a level of precision that doesn't exist yet.<br/><br/>To build it, we need people who are obsessive… <a href=\"https://t.co/iCHaMUwdEw\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/iCHaMUwdEw</a></p>— Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deepigoyal/status/2027256222660133375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script tcembed--twitter\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded wearables market, where companies such as Whoop, Oura, and Garmin have spent years refining devices that track sleep, recovery, and athletic performance. Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/deepinder-goyal-expands-continue-research-with-25-million-fund-to-back-longevity-researchers/articleshow/124780807.cms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">committed $25 million</a> of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">purchase of Uber Eats’ India business</a> in 2020 and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/zomato-blinkit/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grocery delivery platform Blinkit</a> — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/ultrahuman-unveils-new-smart-ring-as-it-awaits-u-s-clearance-after-oura-dispute/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ultrahuman</a>, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal declined to comment further on Temple.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">OpenAI has raised $110 billion in private funding, the company announced Friday morning, commencing one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the round has remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together with Amazon, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon’s Bedrock platform</a>. The company will also expand its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">previously announced AWS partnership</a>, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Tranium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is developing…</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">After years of appeals, Google has finally received conditional approval to export high-precision geographic information out of South Korea, a move that opens the door to let the company provide proper Google Maps services in the country, such as walking and real-time driving directions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reverses a long-standing policy on data restrictions that had essentially made Google Maps and Apple Maps non-functional in the country. Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data.  Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The green light comes with <a href=\"https://www.molit.go.kr/USR/NEWS/m_72/dtl.jsp?id=95091751\" rel=\"nofollow\">strict rules</a> designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/c/google/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">an array of data centers</a> in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/ultrahuman-ring-air-review/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ring Air</a> — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ruled in Oura’s favor</a> in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August 2025, Ultrahuman also <a href=\"https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/ultrahuman-files-patent-infringement-suit-against-oura/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">filed a separate patent infringement case</a> against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It <a href=\"https://cyborg.ultrahuman.com/press-releases/ultrahuman-delivers-record-fy25-profits-as-subscription-engine-accelerates\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reported $64 million</a> in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Separate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months.</p>\n</div>",

Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103282/cbs-chief-bari-weiss-pulls-60-minutes-story\" rel=\"nofollow\">shelved</a> or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss.

Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks.

            "title": "Jack Dorsey just halved the size of Block’s employee base — and he says your company is next",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Dorsey <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-to-lay-off-4-000-employees-in-ai-remake-28f0d869\" rel=\"nofollow\">half</a> its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.” Salesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of companies that have made <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">enormous</a> staffing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cuts</a> citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-impact-ai-jobs-forecast/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cast some doubt</a> on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" rel=\"nofollow\">believes</a> it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday at 5:01 PM <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-wont-budge-as-pentagon-escalates-ai-dispute/\">deadline</a> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">attempted to force Amodei’s hand</a> by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.
