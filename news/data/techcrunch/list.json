The move comes a week after the design company <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/figma-anthropic-ai-code-designs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">struck</a> a similar partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude Code.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration lets users start working with a design in Figma or code in Codex, and move between the two platforms easily using Figma’s MCP (Mobile Context Protocol) server.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, users could bring details from Figma design files, Figma Make, or FigJam into Codex for code-based implementation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this integration, teams can build on their best ideas—not just their first idea—by combining the best of code with the creativity, collaboration, and craft that comes with Figma’s infinite canvas,” Loredan Crisan, Figma’s chief design officer, said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p><div class=\"jwppp-video-box\" data-video=\"1\" id=\"jwppp-video-box-30973171\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\" style=\"margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<meta content=\"Codex To Figma Demo\" itemprop=\"name\"/>\n<meta content=\"-\" itemprop=\"description\"/>\n<meta content=\"PT0H0M36S\" itemprop=\"duration\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/XPZLVZKr-720.jpg\" itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\"/>\n<meta content=\"2026-02-26T06:00:00-08:00\" itemprop=\"uploadDate\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/XPZLVZKr\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"/>\n<span class=\"jwppp-instant\" data-height=\"270\" data-video=\"https://techcrunch.com/?jwp-instant-articles=1&amp;player=GQNKsmiX&amp;mediaID=XPZLVZKr\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><div class=\"jwplayer\" id=\"jwppp-video-30973171\">Loading the player…</div>\n<script class=\"tcembed-script\" src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/libraries/GQNKsmiX.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar playerInstance_30973171 = jwplayer( \"jwppp-video-30973171\" );\nplayerInstance_30973171.setup({\nplaylist: \"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/XPZLVZKr\",\n})\n</script></div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The integration makes Codex powerful for a much broader range of builders and businesses because it doesn’t assume you’re ‘a designer’ or ‘an engineer’ first. Engineers can iterate visually without leaving their flow, and designers can work closer to real implementation without becoming full-time coders,” Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said in a statement.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI first launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/\">Codex as a command-line coding assistant</a> last year to compete with Anthropic’s much lauded Claude Code.

Jest believes that the future of gaming won’t come from an app store, but rather from right within your messaging app. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments. With RCS making significant advancements, the landscape is shifting dramatically. In 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/apple-finally-adds-support-for-rcs-in-latest-ios-18-beta/\">Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18</a>, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-1b-rcs-messages-sent-in-the-u-s-daily/\">according to Google</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097049\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=800,425 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=1161,617 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=708,376 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=50,27 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) This convenience is particularly impactful as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/\">consumers are downloading fewer games</a>. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1,000,000 messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

What’s most appealing for developers is the revenue model: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in stark contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.” </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform.  This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026.</p>\n</div>",

These earphones have a flatter stem design than their predecessors, and are rated IP54 and IP57, which means they are somewhat protected from dust and water.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Samsung says the Buds4 Pro has a new 11mm woofer, which widens the speaker area by 20%. The Pro models also feature a slightly longer battery life without the case compared to the regular version.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097301\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"510\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-2026-Galaxy-Buds4-Series-Launch_Main1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Buds4 are priced at $179 while the Buds4 Pro cost $250.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">This week on TechCrunch’s founder-focused podcast, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/build-mode/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Build Mode</a>, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Sarah Lucena, the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/mappas-ai-voice-analysis-helps-you-find-the-best-job-candidates-and-will-show-off-its-tech-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mappa</a>, a behavioral intelligence platform that uses voice AI to decode human behavior in less than 60 seconds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucena got the idea for Mappa after trying to build a marketing team but continually feeling like she had made the wrong hires. “And I was so frustrated because I was hiring for what I thought were the right skills. It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The alerts are launching in the coming weeks to parents who are enrolled in parental supervision on Instagram. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Meta-owned social platform says that while it already blocks users from searching for suicide and self-harm content, these new alerts are designed to make sure parents are aware if their teen is repeatedly trying to search for this content so that they can support their teen.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Searches that may trigger an alert include phrases encouraging suicide or self-harm, phrases indicating a teen might be at risk of harming themselves, and terms such as “suicide” or “self-harm.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instagram says parents will receive the alert via email, text, or WhatsApp, depending on the contact information they’ve provided, along with an in-app notification.

The study also found that children who faced stressful life events were more likely to struggle with regulating their social media use appropriately.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the ongoing lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect teens on its platforms, the timing of these new alerts isn’t exactly surprising.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that it will aim to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, as overuse could reduce their overall effectiveness.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In working to strike this important balance, we analyzed Instagram search behavior and consulted with experts from our Suicide and Self-Harm Advisory Group,” Instagram explained in a blog post. “We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution. While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be a real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The alerts are rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada next week, and will become available in other regions later this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Instagram plans to launch these notifications when a teen tries to engage the app’s AI in conversations about suicide or self-harm. </p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: This isn’t our first SaaSpocalypse",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Salesforce pulled out all the stops to convince investors that the AI revolution won’t be its death when it <a href=\"http://t\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced </a>fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce reported a solid quarter of $10.7 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\">data management company Informatica</a> last May.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Net income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with <a href=\"https://x.com/anshublog/status/2018762793978413111\" rel=\"nofollow\">Salesforce as their poster child,</a> have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat <a href=\"https://x.com/mcuban/status/2026690613014298881\" rel=\"nofollow\">business models obsolete</a>. The situation has been dubbed the “Saaspocalypse.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&amp;A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja, the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: they all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: Agentic Work Units (“AWU”). The idea here is that rather than simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task, like writing to a record, rather than just generating text. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really <a href=\"https://www.saastr.com/the-real-data-on-ai-agents-what-1-trillion-tokens-a-day-reveals-with-openrouters-coo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">is not</a> in the AI world.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce President and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable task.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself <a href=\"https://x.com/Benioff/status/2026803953342755116/photo/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">owning most of the tech stack</a>, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier,</a> platform. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019413714341097945\" rel=\"nofollow\">on the bottom as the unseen engines</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">As AI-powered search tools reshape how businesses are discovered online, India-founded startup <a href=\"https://www.gushwork.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gushwork</a> is helping companies capture customers from platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity — with early traction that is beginning to draw investor support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old startup said Thursday it had raised $9 million in a seed round led by Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and Lightspeed, with participation from B Capital, Seaborne Capital, Beenext, Sparrow Capital, and 2.2 Capital. The round values Gushwork at $33 million post-money, up from about $7.5 million following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/gushwork-ai-funding-lightspeed/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lightspeed-led $2.1 million pre-seed</a> in July 2023, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The latest financing brings Gushwork’s total funding to $11 million, the startup said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as AI companies including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/perplexity-received-780-million-queries-last-month-ceo-says/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Perplexity</a> begin to chip away at traditional web search, prompting incumbents like Google to roll out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI-generated overviews</a> and other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/google-now-lets-users-jump-from-ai-overviews-into-ai-mode-conversations/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conversational features</a> across their search products. Gushwork is betting this shift will create a new opportunity to help businesses surface in AI-driven discovery channels using its automated marketing agents.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2023 by Nayrhit Bhattacharya (pictured above, right) and Adithya Venkatesh (pictured above, left), Gushwork initially focused on helping small and medium businesses outsource workflows using a mix of AI and human expertise. The startup began narrowing its focus toward search-led marketing after seeing strong customer demand for help with improving online visibility.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started, we were focused on helping businesses outsource faster and outsource better,” Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview, adding that the pull around search from customers became increasingly hard to ignore.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s platform uses a network of AI agents to automatically generate and update search-optimized content, build backlinks — typically 10 to 20 per customer — through a network of roughly 200 to 300 partner websites, and track inbound leads through an integrated content management system. The goal, Bhattacharya said, is to help businesses surface in both traditional search results and AI-generated answers without relying on large in-house marketing teams.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says it has signed up more than 300 paying customers — roughly 95% of them in the U.S. — with subscriptions starting at $800 per month. Gushwork is currently running at about $1.5 million in annualized recurring revenue after rolling out its AI search-focused product around three months ago and is targeting $3 million to $3.5 million ARR in the next three months, Bhattacharya said, adding that the startup is growing about 50% to 80% month over month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

In one case, a professional services client has closed between $200,000 and $350,000 worth of contracts after adopting the platform, he said, declining to disclose the customer’s name. He added that many users are seeing meaningful pipeline growth as AI-driven discovery gains traction.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s customer base today is concentrated among high-ticket B2B service providers, industrial distributors, and contract manufacturers, primarily in the U.S., Bhattacharya said. The startup’s average subscription runs about $800 to $900 per month, or roughly $9,000 to $10,000 in annual contract value, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward AI-driven discovery is still in its early stages but is gaining momentum. Tools such as generative AI chatbots and AI web browsers are increasingly being used by buyers to research vendors and products. OpenAI said in July 2025 that ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">received about 2.5 billion prompts a day</a> globally, including roughly 330 million from U.S. users. Bhattacharya said the trend is beginning to reshape how some businesses approach online visibility.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork plans to use the new funding to expand its engineering team, improve model accuracy and scale its go-to-market efforts, Bhattacharya said. He added that the startup has more than 800 businesses on its waitlist that it plans to begin onboarding.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, headquartered in Delaware with an office in Bengaluru, has about 70 employees in India, along with several contractors.</p>\n</div>",

The acquisition marks the latest after Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/anthropic-acquires-bun-claude-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquired coding agent engine Bun</a> in December to help scale Claude Code. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vercept had created tools for more complex agentic tasks, including its product Vy, a computer-use agent in the cloud that could operate a remote Apple Macbook. Vercept is one of the many startups working on re-imagining the personal computer for the age of AI agents. As part of the deal, Anthropic is shuttering Vercept’s product on March 25.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup was a grad of Seattle’s AI-focused <a href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\" rel=\"nofollow\">incubator A12,</a> which spawned from the longstanding Allen Institute for AI. Vercept’s co-founders had roots with the Allen Institute, as well, and were previously researchers there.

In a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vercept-joining-anthropic-kiana-ehsani-nddmf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a> announcing the acquisition by Anthropic, Vercept CEO Kiana Ehsani said the startup had raised a total of $50 million. She called out A12’s Seth Bannon, a board member, as the lead investor. Vercept previously announced it had raised a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vercept_we-are-excited-to-announce-we-raised-our-activity-7335699688777531393-VrRy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$16 million seed round</a> last January. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The list of angel investors was impressive, too, and included former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/anthropic-acquires-vercept-in-early-exit-for-one-of-seattles-standout-ai-startups/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geekwire reported.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Anthropic’s announcement of the acquisition, the company named co-founders Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick as some of the team brought on to join Anthropic in the acquisition.

He is also not joining Anthropic, and vocally less pleased about the acqui-hire. He posted <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432470782834008066/\" rel=\"nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>: “After a little bit more than a year, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vercept/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vercept</a> is throwing in the towel and giving their customers 30 days to get off the platform. Sad. A fantastic team is joining Anthropic. I wish them the very best!”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etzioni is also a professor at the University of Washington and known for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oren-etzioni-is-one-successful-founder-2013-9#:~:text=Oren%20Etzioni%20Could%20Be%20The,You've%20Never%20Heard%20Of&amp;text=Decide.com%20announced%20on%20Friday,now%20go%20work%20for%20eBay.\" rel=\"nofollow\">other startups</a> he’s founded and backed as a VC. He did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Etzioni’s LinkedIn post, he accused Bannon, the Vercept lead investor, of being “partly responsible” for Vercept not hiring the correct business people.  A back and forth ensued between the investors, with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432495494322597888/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bannon condemning</a> Etzioni’s remarks: “… you disparaged the heroic work of the founders for achieving an outcome most could only dream of,” Bannon replied in the LinkedIn string. They also accused each other of other less savory things like lying and legal threats.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While public spats between investors are entertaining, and essentially meaningless, the underlying motivation is notable. The stakes are high to build the next-big AI winner and now a promising startup that raised a decently sized warchest will be tucked into Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Etzioni says he got a return on his money. Anthropic clearly wanted these researchers (perhaps — especially — with another of them at Meta).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Etzioni told GeekWire that he remains bummed. “I’m pleased to have gotten a positive return but obviously disappointed that after just a little over a year with so much traction, and such a fantastic team, we’re basically throwing in the towel,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders joining Anthropic, however, appear happy, according to CEO’s Ehsani’s LinkedIn post. “The choices were clear: we could build independently and work toward the same vision as two separate versions of it, or join forces with an incredible team and accelerate that vision into reality. The decision became an easy choice,” she said of joining Anthropic.</p>\n</div>",

The company reported $215 billion in revenue for the full year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in previous quarters, the company did not report any revenue from chip exports to China, despite the recent lifting of export restrictions by the U.S. government. “While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the US government, they have yet to generate any revenue, and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,” Colette Kress, the company’s chief financial officer, said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress,” she continued, in an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moore Threads’ IPO in December</a>, “and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the investor call, Huang also addressed the company’s pending investment in OpenAI, which has been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/nvidia-is-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-openai-source-says.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported at $30 billion</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

We believe we are close,” Huang said. He also referenced partnerships with Anthropic, Meta, and Elon Musk’s xAI. However, <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001045810/e361e58a-7483-44f5-bc62-a9080ae6ec72.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">statements Nvidia filed</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday emphasized that there was “no assurance” an investment would take place.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huang also addressed concerns about the sustainability of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\">tech companies’ capex commitments</a>, saying he believed the compute investments would soon bring revenue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In this new world of AI, compute <em>is</em> revenue. Without compute, there’s no way to generate tokens. Without tokens, there’s no way to grow revenues,” Huang said. “We’ve reached the inflection point and we’re generating profitable tokens that are productive for customers and profitable for the cloud service providers”</p>\n</div>",
