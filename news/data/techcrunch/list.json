For the first time, F1 fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the live race simultaneously on both Apple TV and Netflix. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix subscribers will be able to stream the full race weekend — including practice, qualifying, and the Grand Prix itself on May 24 — live on the platform.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Beyond live race coverage, the partnership includes cross-promotion of Netflix’s hit series, “Drive to Survive.” For the first time, the eighth season — which consists of eight episodes covering the 2025 Formula One World Championship — will be available to both Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. and Netflix users globally, significantly broadening its audience. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Season 8 premieres today, on February 27. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">F1’s rise in American culture extends beyond television at this point — Brad Pitt’s F1 film is nominated for Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. “Drive to Survive” has successfully <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4402239/2023/04/13/f1-formula-one-drive-to-survive-ratings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">attracted a diverse audience</a> for its behind-the-scenes approach, transforming it from a typical sports docuseries into a compelling narrative that’s brought in millions of new fans. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The series has been a particular focus of Apple’s broader F1 ambitions: the company has said it plans to promote the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps (highlighting F1 tracks around the world), Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as in its physical retail stores.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This collaboration also means Netflix continues to push into live sports broadcasting, after pivoting from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/25/netflix-is-not-yet-considering-live-sports-but-heres-why-it-should/\">“no-sports” stance</a> to securing major rights for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/netflix-adds-more-live-tv-to-its-lineup/\">NFL Christmas games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-raw-netflix-release-date-news\" rel=\"nofollow\">WWE Raw</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/mlb-netflix-opening-day-home-run-derby-field-of-dreams\" rel=\"nofollow\">MLB</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Fans have also honed in on a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-winds-waves-cloud-legendary-gyarados-theories-trailer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">suspicious-looking cloud</a> in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly ten years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"bluesky-embed\" data-bluesky-cid=\"bafyreie3rgahsrfq6o2jgmgzjiayu7h27gdpj2jcsyatghr2mlcyn3lnle\" data-bluesky-uri=\"at://did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/app.bsky.feed.post/3mftx5zaug22f\"><p lang=\"pt\">pokémon white lotus</p>— <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y?ref_src=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">stanley tucci da grande sp (@fullofentulho.bsky.social)</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/post/3mftx5zaug22f?ref_src=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">2026-02-27T14:44:57.713Z</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script\" src=\"https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Main series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region… but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/\">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>” came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the “Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen” games today for the Switch… but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/\">extremely easy and legally dubious</a> way to get those games on your phone for free. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Hkq2C4Wr9rhr0OV9hOfNI4oA4y?domain=perplexity.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">example workflows</a> on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097675\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg 3799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1200,621 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1280,663 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=430,223 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=720,373 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=900,466 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=800,414 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1536,795 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=2048,1060 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=668,346 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1192,617 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=708,367 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Anthropic has reached a stalemate with the United States Department of War over the military’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/\">request for unrestricted access</a> to the AI company’s technology. But as the Pentagon’s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friday afternoon deadline</a> for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, over 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed <a href=\"https://notdivided.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an open letter</a> urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-ai-policy-war-spying.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">confirmed</a> that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Agreed.

Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/trumps-acting-cybersecurity-chief-uploaded-sensitive-government-docs-to-chatgpt/\">security headaches</a>, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports.

Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently-launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">“Page Match” tool</a>, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s Director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-02-27/audiobook-charts-launch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">purchase physical copies</a> of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org.</p>\n</div>",

More than 30 employees participated at the same valuation, he said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/eternal-ceo-deepinder-goyal-hands-over-reins-to-blinkit-chief-as-quick-commerce-takes-off/\">handing the role to</a> Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Temple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xik34jh-doc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple <a href=\"https://x.com/deepigoyal/status/2027256222660133375\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">aims to build</a> what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain–computer interface engineering.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We're recruiting at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/temple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">@temple</a>.<br/><br/>At Temple, we are building the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes.

Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/deepinder-goyal-expands-continue-research-with-25-million-fund-to-back-longevity-researchers/articleshow/124780807.cms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">committed $25 million</a> of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">purchase of Uber Eats’ India business</a> in 2020 and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/zomato-blinkit/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grocery delivery platform Blinkit</a> — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/ultrahuman-unveils-new-smart-ring-as-it-awaits-u-s-clearance-after-oura-dispute/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ultrahuman</a>, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal declined to comment further on Temple.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">OpenAI has raised $110 billion in private funding, the company announced Friday morning, commencing one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the round has remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together with Amazon, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon’s Bedrock platform</a>. The company will also expand its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">previously announced AWS partnership</a>, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Tranium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is developing…</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "title": "South Korea opens the door to let Google Maps operate fully",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">After years of appeals, Google has finally received conditional approval to export high-precision geographic information out of South Korea, a move that opens the door to let the company provide proper Google Maps services in the country, such as walking and real-time driving directions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reverses a long-standing policy on data restrictions that had essentially made Google Maps and Apple Maps non-functional in the country. Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data.  Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The green light comes with <a href=\"https://www.molit.go.kr/USR/NEWS/m_72/dtl.jsp?id=95091751\" rel=\"nofollow\">strict rules</a> designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/c/google/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">an array of data centers</a> in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents.</p>\n</div>",
