As part of the partnership, it is using Leica lenses and creating filters in the style of the German camera company. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone has a 50-megapixel main sensor with an F/1.67 aperture and a 1-inch sensor. But the main attraction is the 200-megapixel telephoto camera that has a variable focal length of 75mm-100mm equivalent. That means you can zoom optically between 3.2x and 4.3x. The phone also has a 50 MP ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3098179\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png 1265w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=720,404 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=900,505 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=800,449 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=1099,617 1099w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=708,397 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Xiaomi</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Xiaomi</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also notable: The phone packs a 6,000 mAh battery (the Chinese version comes with a bigger 6,800mAh battery).

Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2026/01/09/top-10-humanoid-robot-companies-by-shipments-revealed/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">according to a Forbes</a> report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.) </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20260219/f2e7e299286e4956862a500317b20acd/c.html#:~:text=Four%20prominent%20rising%20humanoid%20robot,appeared%20in%20regional%20arts%20events.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.</a> </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-robotics-firm-unitree-eyeing-7-billion-ipo-valuation-sources-say-2025-09-08/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$7 billion in a future IPO</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galbot-secures-over-300-million-190800748.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Galbot</a> has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/12/16/humanoid-robots-for-war-and-work-startup-plans-to-build-50000-by-end-of-2027/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. startup Foundation</a>, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251209-12825.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TrendForce report</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bottlenecks-nbsp-to-china-s-dominance\">Bottlenecks to China’s dominance</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Safety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-other-apac-players-nbsp\">Other APAC players </h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is <a href=\"https://japan-forward.com/japan-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">targeting humanoid mass production by 2027</a>. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001105\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028</a>, with plans to produce up to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/hyundai-unveils-new-humanoid-robot-to-work-in-its-car-factories?srnd=undefined\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">30,000 units annually in the U.S.</a> as part of its AI-driven robotics push.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&amp;D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.” </p>\n</div>",

New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company <a href=\"https://x.com/supabase/status/2026374754438087119\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledging the issue</a> in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/indian-government-censorsht/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">access to developer platform GitHub</a>, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe.

            "title": "Musk bashes OpenAI in deposition, saying ‘nobody committed suicide because of Grok’",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety.  He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comment came up in a line of questioning about a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/1100-notable-signatories-just-signed-an-open-letter-asking-all-ai-labs-to-immediately-pause-for-at-least-6-months/\">public letter</a> Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a <a href=\"https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-tech-justice-law-project-lawsuits-accuse-chatgpt-of-emotional-manipulation-supercharging-ai-delusions-and-acting-as-a-suicide-coach/\" rel=\"nofollow\">series of lawsuits</a> alleging that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics</a> have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/elon-musk-openai-sam-altman-court/\">lawsuit</a> against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\">Musk claims violated</a> its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own, however. Last month, Musk’s social network X was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">flooded with non-consensual nude images</a> generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">were said to be of minors</a>. This led the California Attorney General’s office to <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">open an investigation</a> into the matter. The EU is also <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/musks-grok-chatbot-faces-eu-privacy-investigation-over-sexualized-deepfake-images\" rel=\"nofollow\">running its own investigation</a>, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted to — AI safety to be prioritized.” …</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?w=500\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" style=\"width:370px;height:auto\" width=\"500\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>imgflip</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI —  the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/\">supposed $100 million donation</a> to OpenAI; the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/170/musk-v-altman/\" rel=\"nofollow\">second amended complaint</a> in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The past two weeks have been defined by a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">clash</a> between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/\">Amodei publicly signaled</a> that Anthropic isn’t backing down – despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-anthropic-worried-about\"><strong>What is Anthropic worried about?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no human in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons.The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems.

Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as ‘lawful use.’</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high stakes calls.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-the-pentagon-want\"><strong>What does the Pentagon want?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thursday X post</a> that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Anthropic has until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the Department’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times  seemed connected to cultural grievance. In <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4377190/remarks-by-secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-at-spacex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January</a>, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-now\"><strong>So what now?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01pm on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DOD, it could be a national security issue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second- or third-best.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2027294561467613256\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elon Musk’s rhetoric </a>on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DOD total control over its technology. Recent <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/\">settled its lawsuit</a> and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">How Was I Supposed to Know</a>” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$3 million</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many musicians have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/nicki-minaj-billie-eilish-katy-perry-and-other-musicians-sign-letter-against-irresponsible-ai/\">spoken out</a> against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",
