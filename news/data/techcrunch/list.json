(Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, I have received the message three times thus far to my personal email.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Penn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch in an email on Friday that the school’s incident response team is “actively addressing” the situation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A fraudulent email has been circulated that appears to come from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. This is obviously a fake, and nothing in the highly offensive, hurtful message reflects the mission or actions of Penn or of Penn GSE,” said the spokesperson. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the hackers plainly stated in their message (“Please stop giving us money”), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. The breach also comes soon after the university <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/10/penn-rejects-white-house-compact\" rel=\"nofollow\">publicly rebuffed</a> the White House’s offer to make commitments aligned with the Trump administration’s political agenda in exchange for federal funding. Penn and <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/10/penn-transparency-compact-letter-jameson-white-house\" rel=\"nofollow\">six other schools</a> have rejected the White House’s proposal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The White House’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” asks universities to abolish affirmative action in hiring and admissions, and to discipline departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compact signatories would also be required to freeze tuition for five years, offer tuition-free education to students pursuing “hard sciences,” cap international undergrad enrollment at 15%, and require standardized tests like the SAT for admission. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The compact also mandates that schools enforce policies that marginalize transgender and gender non-conforming students.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The compact] preferences and mandates protections for the communication of conservative thought alone,” wrote Penn President J. Larry Jameson in his <a href=\"https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/penns-written-response-compact-academic-excellence\" rel=\"nofollow\">response</a> to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, which was published on the university’s website.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One-sided conditions conflict with the viewpoint diversity and freedom of expression that are central to how universities contribute to democracy and to society,” wrote Jameson.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Amazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is on track to record its strongest year of growth in three years, fueled by the AI industry’s unprecedented demand for computing power.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is growing 20% year-over-year and ended the third quarter with $33.1 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, Amazon announced in its <a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">third-quarter earnings release</a> on Thursday. The business segment’s operating income increased to $11.4 billion in Q3, up from $10.4 billion at the same point in 2024.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY,” Andy Jassy, the president and CEO of Amazon said in the company’s earnings announcement. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS launched an infrastructure region in New Zealand during the quarter and has three more regions in the pipeline.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud infrastructure provider also secured several new deals in Q3 across a variety of industries including a few notable names in the AI market. In July, <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-collaborates-with-amazon-web-services-to-launch-enterprise-pro\" rel=\"nofollow\">AWS partnered with Perplexity</a> to launch the AI browser company’s enterprise product. AWS also partnered with Cursor during the third quarter.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The intense infrastructure demands of AI have also been a boon to AWS’s competitors. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal/\">OpenAI and Oracle allegedly inked a massive $300 billion cloud compute deal</a> in September that will start in 2027. The pair also made a deal for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/\">OpenAI to pay Oracle $30 billion a year</a> for data center services. Last week, Google and Anthropic announced a cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These huge deals come despite skepticism of how much cloud infrastructure will actually be needed in the future and if the industry is heading into bubble territory. However, it does makes sense for cloud companies like AWS to take advantage of a market where customers are willing to pay big sums for their services.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Ribbon said it notified law enforcement and that it believes the hackers are no longer in its network.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Texas-headquartered Ribbon provides phone, networking, and internet services for companies, enterprises, and critical infrastructure organizations, such as energy and transportation systems. The company counts hundreds of companies as customers, including Fortune 500 firms and government agencies, such as the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reuters, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-company-with-access-biggest-telecom-firms-uncovers-breach-by-nation-state-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">first reported news of the breach</a>, said three of Ribbon’s customers are known to be affected, but the companies were not named.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if the hackers exfiltrated personally identifiable information belonging to any individuals or other sensitive data from its corporate customers in the breach, but the company noted in the filing that “several customer files saved outside of the main network on two laptops do appear to have been accessed by the threat actor.” Ribbon said it notified the affected customers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ribbon is the latest in a series of telecommunication providers to have been hacked over the past two years, though the company did not immediately say which government it believes is behind the intrusions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Catherine Berthier, a spokesperson for Ribbon, did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chinese-backed hackers have previously targeted and compromised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/\">at least 200 U.S.-based companies</a>, including phone and internet providers, in an effort to steal phone records and calling data about senior U.S. government officials. Several telcos, including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen, were confirmed hacked as part of the campaign, along with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/canada-says-telcos-were-breached-in-china-linked-espionage-hacks/\">cloud giants and datacenter providers</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the companies were located outside of the United States, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/canada-says-telcos-were-breached-in-china-linked-espionage-hacks/\">including Canada</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers, known as Salt Typhoon, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/meet-the-chinese-typhoon-hackers-preparing-for-war/\">one of several China-backed hacking groups</a> said to be targeting the U.S. and its allies as part of a multi-year effort to prepare for a future anticipated Chinese invasion of Taiwan, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/31/fbi-cisa-volt-typhoon-cyberattack-american-infastructure/\">according to U.S. government officials</a>.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AI search startup Perplexity has signed a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images, which gives it  permission to display images from Getty across its AI-powered search and discovery tools. The deal marks a notable shift for the company, which has been hit by allegations of content scraping and plagiarism, and signals an effort to establish more formal content partnerships. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity and Getty have been working together for more than a year, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. Though it was never announced, Getty was part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/perplexitys-plan-to-share-ad-revenue-with-outlets-cited-by-its-ai-chatbot/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Perplexity’s Publishers’ Program</a>, a plan to share ad revenue with publishers when their content surfaced in a search query, the source said.  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s agreement is a new deal. A source told TechCrunch it’s not a traditional lump sum licensing deal, since Perplexity doesn’t train its own foundational models, but would not elaborate on the terms. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity’s agreement with Getty appears to legitimize some of the startup’s previous use of Getty’s stock photos. Perplexity came under fire last year for a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">series of plagiarism accusations</a> from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">several news organizations</a>. In one case, the startup was called out for pulling content from a Wall Street Journal article, including the Getty photo <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musk-sam-altman-openai-lawsuit-8e6f1897\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">in that piece</a>.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, several outlets <a href=\"https://stackdiary.com/perplexity-has-a-plagiarism-problem/?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">questioned</a> whether Perplexity’s use of the images constituted <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/how-to-stop-perplexity-oreilly-ai-publishing/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">copyright infringement</a>. A source last year told TechCrunch that Perplexity was working on an agreement with Getty, but we were unable to confirm the deal after reaching out to stock image giant several times.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/reddit-sues-perplexity-scraping-data-train-ai-system-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit sued Perplexity</a> in October, alleging “industrial-scale, unlawful” scraping of user content and circumventing technical measures to access data. Reddit has a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/openai-inks-deal-to-train-ai-on-reddit-data/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data licensing agreement with OpenAI</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity says its Getty deal will help it better display images and include credits with links back to the original source whenever images show up in search results. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nick Unsworth, vice president of strategic development at Getty, <a href=\"https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-and-perplexity-strike-multi-year-image-partnership\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the agreement “acknowledges the importance of properly attributed consent and its value in enhancing AI-powered products.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand the world in an age of AI,” Jessica Chan, head of content and publisher partnerships at Perplexity, said in a statement. “Together, we’re helping people discover answers through powerful visual storytelling while ensuring they always know where that content comes from and who created it.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity’s emphasis on attribution is part of its strategy of defending against copyright accusations by arguing its use of publisher content – including content behind a paywall or that publishers have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explicitly indicated they don’t want scraped</a> – constitutes “fair use” because publicly available facts are not copyrightable.</p>\n</div>",

The exec also offered a brief update about Apple’s next-generation, AI-powered Siri, saying the service was still on track to launch in 2026.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re making good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it next year,” Cook said during his opening remarks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One analyst on the call also asked Cook if Apple was still pursuing a three-pronged approach when it came to the development of its personalized AI — meaning a combination of in-house Apple foundation models, partnerships with third-party LLM providers, and acquisitions. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook responded that Apple was still open to the latter, noting the company continually surveils the market on M&amp;A and  is “open to pursuing M&amp;A if we think that it will advance our roadmap.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">pre-earnings interview with CNBC</a>, Cook noted that Apple was preparing to announce more AI partnerships like the one it has with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,” Cook told the outlet.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the earnings call, Cook also talked about how Apple creates foundation models, ships them on devices, and uses them in <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Private Cloud Compute</a>, its cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook shared later in the call that Apple is already using its Private Cloud Compute technology for a number of Siri queries and is continuing to build out that infrastructure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we’ve got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. And, you know, it’s robust,” he said. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook additionally suggested that AI was a factor in consumers’ decision-making process when it comes to selecting a new smartphone. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor,” he said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Lidar-maker Luminar is warning shareholders that it will run out of cash in early 2026 and has announced a 25% cut to its workforce to help staunch the bleeding — its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/luminar-kicks-off-another-round-of-layoffs-amid-ceos-sudden-resignation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">second layoff</a> of the year — according to a Friday regulatory <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000175805725000006/lazr-20251030.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">filing</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not immediately clear how many workers will be affected. Luminar started the year with around 580 employees, but the company did not specify the size of the layoff earlier this year. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced its chief financial officer, Thomas Fennimore, is stepping down on November 13 “to pursue other career opportunities.” Luminar said Fennimore’s departure is “not the result of any disagreement” about its finances or with the company’s auditors.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all comes as founder Austin Russell — who was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/billionaire-founder-of-luminar-replaced-as-ceo-following-ethics-inquiry/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">replaced</a> as CEO in May following an unspecified ethics inquiry by the board of directors’ audit committee — is in the middle of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an effort to buy the company</a>. That buyout was encouraged by at least some of the board members, as TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has struggled in part because it has sold fewer lidar sensors to Volvo, which was supposed to be a major customer. In August, Fennimore said Luminar was therefore <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000175805725000006/lazr-20251030.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">selling the sensors at a lower cost</a> than it takes to build them. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar said Friday that it has $72 million of cash and marketable securities as of October 24. Without any additional fundraising, the current burn rate means Luminar could run out of money as early as the first quarter of next year, or breach the terms of certain loan agreements. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Luminar revealed it had already skipped required quarterly interest payments on certain loans that were due October 15. Those lenders have agreed to give Luminar until November 6 to make the payments before taking any action.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar is not due to report its third-quarter financial results for another two weeks, but on Friday, it revealed it expects to report around $18 million of revenue and debt of $429 million.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://adam.new/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam</a>, one of the most viral startups in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch, has raised a $4.1 million seed round to power its next steps, TechCrunch learned exclusively.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After generating over 10 million social media impressions with the launch of its text-to-3D model app, the AI startup had its pick of investors. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were getting term sheets over email without any meetings,” said CEO Zach Dive (on the right of the picture).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adam quickly went with <a href=\"https://tq.vc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TQ Ventures</a> as its lead investor because they agreed on the future of computer-aided design (CAD). Just as importantly, they also agreed on Adam’s roadmap — going consumer first, and then to enterprise.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This required the most alignment: Adam caught people’s attention with a mainstream product, not an enterprise one. But Dive said this choice is paying off, and paving the way for Adam’s upcoming copilot for professional-grade CAD workflows.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup had always planned to go B2B, but felt that the technology wasn’t enterprise-ready yet — which is why it initially focused on makers, not engineers. But AI models improved faster than they expected, and Adam now plans to launch its copilot by the end of the year, Dive said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its initial tool lets creators without CAD skills create 3D models from text prompts, but early feedback showed that text wasn’t always the best way to interact with 3D, Dive said. “So for our copilot, we blended in different interaction paradigms; for example, users selecting different parts of the 3D object and conversing with it.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This will give the startup an element of differentiation compared to <a href=\"http://xometry.pro/en/articles/text-to-cad-tools-test/\" rel=\"nofollow\">other text-to-CAD products</a>, although there is already competition in the ‘AI copilot for CAD’ segment as well. <a href=\"https://mecagent.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MecAgent</a>, for instance, is already available, but Adam could capitalize on its viral launch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early momentum particularly helped with hiring, which is still an ongoing effort, Dive said. He and his cofounder, Adam CPO Aaron Li, both graduated from UC Berkeley’s Master of Design program, but the startup also needs more AI and engineering talent to “give models the right context for reasoning in space.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Capital and endorsements can both help with this endeavor, and Adam now has its fair share of both, sometimes combined. Besides TQ and participating funds 468 Capital, Pioneer, Script Capital, and Transpose Platform, Adam is also backed by angel investors, including Tim Glaser (Posthog), Trevor Blackwell (YC), and Theo Browne (T3 Chat).</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch called Adam “the v0 of CAD” (in a nod to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/vercel-debuts-an-ai-model-optimized-for-web-development/\">Vercel’s V0</a>, an AI-powered platform for web creation). </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s simpler, faster, and reaches a broader audience,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/rauchg/status/1884669642888929351\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote on X</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adam is already on its way to reaching a broad audience, with “tens of thousands of individual users and a growing base of paying customers” for its standard and pro plans, which respectively start at $5.99 and $17.99 per month. The startup hasn’t begun to monetize its soon-to-launch enterprise offering, but has “testers validating different features,” Dive said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This testing phase is clearly necessary: there’s quite a jump from helping amateurs print 3D Pikachus to supporting engineers in their daily work. Dive said the startup doesn’t intend to replace them, but instead streamlines time-consuming tasks such as applying the same change to multiple CAD files.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With an initial focus on mechanical engineering, the startup plans to help these pro users generate feature‑rich parametric designs in popular CAD programs, beginning with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/24/onshape-raises-80-million-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/\">Onshape</a>, which is known for bringing CAD to the cloud and reshaping workflows. “The same thing will be true with AI,” Dive predicted.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said AI chatbots aren’t a major traffic driver for the social platform despite companies like OpenAI and Google having seen progress in people using AI for search. During Reddit’s Q3 2025 call, the exec noted that Google search and direct access continue to be its top traffic drivers. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Chatbots are] not a traffic driver today. I think our relationships with the companies that we work for — or work with directly are healthy, and we both learned a lot over the last couple of years, really the value of Reddit’s data and where our respective products can go and how we can help each other. So I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners. But they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Huffman said during the call with analysts.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An analyst asked the company if 50% of the traffic comes from Google and 50% direct, Huffman said that those numbers are “approximate, but pretty close.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit has had a tricky relationship with LLM builders. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/reddit-locks-down-its-public-data-in-new-content-policy-says-use-now-requires-a-contract/\">locked down its data through a new policy change in May 2024</a> and indicated that any kind of commercial use of its data would need a license. At the same time, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/openai-inks-deal-to-train-ai-on-reddit-data/\">signed a deal with OpenAI</a> to let it use Reddit data for model training. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/reddit-is-said-to-sign-ai-content-licensing-deal-ahead-of-ipo\" rel=\"nofollow\">a partnership agreement with Google</a>. On the other hand, the company has ensued a legal battle with AI companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/reddit-sues-anthropic-for-allegedly-not-paying-for-training-data/\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/reddit-sues-perplexity-scraping-data-train-ai-system-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perplexity</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit reported a positive quarter with $585 million in revenue, up 68% year-on-year. The company also clocked in 116 million daily active unique users and 444 million weekly active unique users, with 20% growth year-over-year. The company mentioned it recorded 31% year-on-year growth in international daily users. It also said that more than 190 million Americans visit the social network every week.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company mentioned that it continues to invest in making the search experience a central part of the experience. Huffman said that the company is handling 20% of search volumes through its AI-powered Answers and “that kind of core search box.” He noted that in Q3, 75 million people searched weekly on Reddit. The company has been talking about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/reddit-plans-to-unify-its-search-interface-as-it-looks-to-become-a-search-engine/\">unifying AI and the core search experience</a>, and Huffman said it is coming in the next few quarters.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, Reddit is experimenting with a new and simpler onboarding flow to increase early user engagement.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want them to see in their first session that Reddit is amazing and has content for them. So our goal is to connect users with relevant content very quickly,” Huffman said.</p>\n</div>",
