Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, warned in <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2026/Feb/25/2003880301/-1/-1/0/CSA_Exploitation_of_SD-WAN_Appliances.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">an alert</a> that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-26-03-mitigate-vulnerabilities-cisco-sd-wan-systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">imminent threat</a> and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/us-cybersecurity-agency-cisa-reportedly-in-dire-shape-amid-trump-cuts-and-layoffs/\">currently running at reduced capacity</a> due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, Cisco warned of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/cisco-says-chinese-hackers-are-exploiting-its-customers-with-a-new-zero-day/\">similarly-rated 10.0 vulnerability</a> in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks.</p>\n</div>",

All told, the project has over 50 donors so far. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder, <a href=\"https://kvinogradov.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Konstantin Vinogradov</a>, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open-source, AI and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov says as he scoured the world for open-source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open-source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open-source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cash-strapped-burned-out\">Cash strapped, burned out</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open-source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open-source developers <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">are not paid for their work.</a> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

And many of them are <a href=\"https://opensourcepledge.com/blog/burnout-in-open-source-a-structural-problem-we-can-fix-together/?ref=itsfoss.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">burned out.</a>  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/massive-security-bug-in-openssl-could-effect-a-huge-chunk-of-the-internet/\">OpenSSL Heartbleed disaster,</a> where a bug was found in an open-source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Foundation-2025-Report\" rel=\"nofollow\">$300 million last year</a> largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation</a>. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/with-ai-investor-loyalty-is-almost-dead-at-least-a-dozen-openai-vcs-now-also-back-anthropic/\">itself raised $30 billion this month</a>. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/open_source_to_closed_doors/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Register reported.</a>  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open-source projects forever.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Elon Musk’s X is making it easier for advertisers to bring their creative campaigns from other social sites to its platform. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, the company launched an expanded set of aspect ratio support for both image and video ads, which means advertisers can now reuse the material they’ve created for other platforms without having to reformat, crop, or rebuild their assets.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI has been helping advertisers automate the process of resizing creative assets for different platforms, it’s easier if advertisers don’t have to take that extra step at all. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So X is now allowing advertisers to upload the same assets they’re using elsewhere on social media to its own X Ads Manager via Media Studio or its Campaign Form.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Seamlessly reuse existing social media creatives directly on X with new expanded ratios – no reformatting required. <a href=\"https://t.co/qevOyL8jPd\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/qevOyL8jPd</a></p>— Business (@XBusiness) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XBusiness/status/2027023344822837738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script tcembed--twitter\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change signals the continued importance of X’s ad business, which suffered declines after the company, then known as Twitter, was acquired by Musk. While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/xs-ad-business-improved-under-departing-ceo-linda-yaccarino-but-its-still-tough-times-ahead/\">ad sales improved</a> under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">were still lower</a> than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">eMarketer’s</a> forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/musk-s-x-posts-higher-sales-amid-costly-turnaround\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The move comes a week after the design company <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/figma-anthropic-ai-code-designs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">struck</a> a similar partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude Code.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration lets users start working with a design in Figma or code in Codex, and move between the two platforms easily using Figma’s MCP (Mobile Context Protocol) server.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, users could bring details from Figma design files, Figma Make, or FigJam into Codex for code-based implementation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this integration, teams can build on their best ideas—not just their first idea—by combining the best of code with the creativity, collaboration, and craft that comes with Figma’s infinite canvas,” Loredan Crisan, Figma’s chief design officer, said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p><div class=\"jwppp-video-box\" data-video=\"1\" id=\"jwppp-video-box-30973171\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\" style=\"margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<meta content=\"Codex To Figma Demo\" itemprop=\"name\"/>\n<meta content=\"-\" itemprop=\"description\"/>\n<meta content=\"PT0H0M36S\" itemprop=\"duration\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/XPZLVZKr-720.jpg\" itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\"/>\n<meta content=\"2026-02-26T06:00:00-08:00\" itemprop=\"uploadDate\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/XPZLVZKr\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"/>\n<span class=\"jwppp-instant\" data-height=\"270\" data-video=\"https://techcrunch.com/?jwp-instant-articles=1&amp;player=GQNKsmiX&amp;mediaID=XPZLVZKr\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><div class=\"jwplayer\" id=\"jwppp-video-30973171\">Loading the player…</div>\n<script class=\"tcembed-script\" src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/libraries/GQNKsmiX.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar playerInstance_30973171 = jwplayer( \"jwppp-video-30973171\" );\nplayerInstance_30973171.setup({\nplaylist: \"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/XPZLVZKr\",\n})\n</script></div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The integration makes Codex powerful for a much broader range of builders and businesses because it doesn’t assume you’re ‘a designer’ or ‘an engineer’ first. Engineers can iterate visually without leaving their flow, and designers can work closer to real implementation without becoming full-time coders,” Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said in a statement.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI first launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/\">Codex as a command-line coding assistant</a> last year to compete with Anthropic’s much lauded Claude Code.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">For years now, when we think of mobile gaming, we think of app stores. Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion—up to 30%—of their earnings to major players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/y-combinator-says-apples-app-store-has-hindered-startup-growth/\">Apple</a> and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meet <a href=\"https://about.jest.com/.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jest</a>, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of gaming won’t come from an app store, but rather from right within your messaging app. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments. With RCS making significant advancements, the landscape is shifting dramatically. In 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/apple-finally-adds-support-for-rcs-in-latest-ios-18-beta/\">Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18</a>, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-1b-rcs-messages-sent-in-the-u-s-daily/\">according to Google</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097049\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=800,425 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=1161,617 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=708,376 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=50,27 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) This convenience is particularly impactful as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/\">consumers are downloading fewer games</a>. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1,000,000 messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

What’s most appealing for developers is the revenue model: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in stark contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.” </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform.  This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026.</p>\n</div>",
