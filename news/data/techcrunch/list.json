            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.einride.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Einride</a> has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-plans-to-go-public-via-a-spac/\">public debut</a> that’s expected for the first half of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Swedish startup is most well-known for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">building both electric trucks and autonomous pods</a> that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States, and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">$100 million previously announced</a> crossover financing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses. Though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/\">public via a SPAC merger</a> valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/techcrunch-mobility-self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-goes-public-and-a-shake-up-at-hyundais-supernal/\">SPAC road</a> to the public market in 2025.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Walmart has <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2026/02/walmart-agrees-100-mil[…]ettle-ftc-states-charges-over-deceptive-earnings-claims-related\" rel=\"nofollow\">agreed to pay $100 million</a> to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over deceptive pay practices within its Spark Driver service, which uses gig workers to deliver online orders from local stores to customers. The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its original <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/WalmartSparkDriverComplaint.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">complaint</a>, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark driver earnings. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Walmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers, as well.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "title": "Bumble adds AI-powered photo feedback and profile guidance tools",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Bumble <a href=\"https://ir.bumble.com/news/news-details/2026/Bumble-Announces-Two-New-Features-For-Confidence-and-Clarity-in-Dating-2026-36eaJ_omGR/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> on Thursday that it’s adding a series of AI-driven features intended to help turn matches into lasting connections, including those that offer feedback and guidance on users’ bios, photos, and prompts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dating app’s new AI-suggested profile guidance tool will roll out globally and give “personalized, actionable feedback” on users’ bios and prompts. For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend ten years ago, but it’s still new information to many users. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/tinder-looks-to-ai-to-help-fight-swipe-fatigue-and-dating-app-burnout/\">Chemistry</a>, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/\">asks to use its AI on your camera roll</a> that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/well/dating-irl-analog-online.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">real-world experiences</a> that are not intermediated by an app.</p>\n</div>",

Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">A group of notable open-source programmers are joining with a VC investor to launch a nonprofit called the <a href=\"https://endowment.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Source Endowment</a> in hopes of permanently solving the perennial issue with developing open-source software: funding. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backers of the Open Source Endowment include Thomas Dohmke (the former GitHub CEO who raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/former-github-ceo-raises-record-60m-dev-tool-seed-round-at-300m-valuation/\">a record $60 million for his dev tool startup Entire</a>); Mitchell Hashimoto (founder of HashiCorp, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/ibm-closes-6-4b-hashicorp-acquisition/\">which sold to IBM for $6.4 billion last year</a>); Supabase founder and CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/supabase-ceo-on-the-painful-decisions-that-built-a-5b-company/\">Paul Copplestone</a>; an NGINX co-founder; the creators of Vue.js and cURL; plus execs from Elastic, Spotify, and others. All told, the project has over 50 donors so far. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder, <a href=\"https://kvinogradov.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Konstantin Vinogradov</a>, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open-source, AI and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov says as he scoured the world for open-source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open-source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open-source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cash-strapped-burned-out\">Cash strapped, burned out</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open-source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open-source developers <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">are not paid for their work.</a> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Open-source software is the bedrock upon which the internet stands, and virtually every large company uses open-source tools in some way. In fact, open-source software accounts for <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/world-of-open-source-global-2025?hsLang=en&amp;_gl=1*3pooru*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjUzMTQ0MDA1LjE3NzE5NjEyMDM.*_ga_BKD8K5CRV0*czE3NzE5NjEyMDIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NzE5NjEyMDIkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_FBYHX832ZD*czE3NzE5NjEyMDIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NzE5NjEyMDIkajYwJGwwJGgw\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to 55% of the tech stack in organizations</a>, and is present in everything from databases to operating systems. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it is certainly possible for open-source developers to commercialize their free projects <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/databricks-perplexity-co-founder-pledges-100m-on-new-fund-for-ai-researchers/\">to gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams</a>, the odds, to misquote the Hunger Games, are not in their favor.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is, and has been for decades, a core of developers who volunteer their time and efforts for free to manage popular, important and critical projects. And many of them are <a href=\"https://opensourcepledge.com/blog/burnout-in-open-source-a-structural-problem-we-can-fix-together/?ref=itsfoss.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">burned out.</a>  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/massive-security-bug-in-openssl-could-effect-a-huge-chunk-of-the-internet/\">OpenSSL Heartbleed disaster,</a> where a bug was found in an open-source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Foundation-2025-Report\" rel=\"nofollow\">$300 million last year</a> largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation</a>. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/with-ai-investor-loyalty-is-almost-dead-at-least-a-dozen-openai-vcs-now-also-back-anthropic/\">itself raised $30 billion this month</a>. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/open_source_to_closed_doors/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Register reported.</a>  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open-source projects forever.</p>\n</div>",

While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/xs-ad-business-improved-under-departing-ceo-linda-yaccarino-but-its-still-tough-times-ahead/\">ad sales improved</a> under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">were still lower</a> than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">eMarketer’s</a> forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/musk-s-x-posts-higher-sales-amid-costly-turnaround\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.
