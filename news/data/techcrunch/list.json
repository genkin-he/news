            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.bevel.health/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bevel</a>, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old healthtech company. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. The company also adds that the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days, rare numbers in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with numerous health companion brands, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/whoop-opens-its-blood-testing-service-to-350000-on-wait-list/\">Whoop</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/smart-ring-maker-oura-raises-900m-from-fidelity/\">Oura</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/19/eight-sleep-grabs-100m-to-bring-ai-into-your-bed/\">Eight Sleep</a>, why does the world need another one?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to co-founder and CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaagarwal3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aditya Agarwal</a>, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area such as steps, sleep, or nutrition, Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which helps analyze key information and adapt recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063834\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1200,600 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1280,640 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=900,450 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1234,617 1234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bevel</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bevel’s story started with pain—literally.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises. The demanding nature of startup life meant Nguyen took little care of his health, developing chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burnt out. What helped was logging his data manually, through spreadsheets and connected trackers, to rebuild his energy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he connected with Ben and Grey about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With fresh capital and no plans to venture into wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand horizontally into more services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app. We’re excited to support this team as they build the future of personal health.”</p>\n</div>",

The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/perplexity-sees-india-as-a-shortcut-in-its-race-against-openai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">teamed up with Reliance’s arch-rival Bharti Airtel</a>, India’s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel’s 360 million subscribers.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, the world’s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier — a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,” the Indian telecom giant said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 18-month offer is valued at ₹35,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google’s AI Pro plan normally <a href=\"https://one.google.com/ai\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">costs ₹1,950</a> (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in India. Reliance’s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations, and will develop its own pre-built AI agents for the platform.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan</a> to all users in India starting November 4.

Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">People are increasingly asking AI, not Google, to help them discover products. A recent <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/goodbye-seo-hello-geo-brandlight-openai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shopping </a>report says Americans, this holiday season, will likely turn to large language models this season to find gifts, deals, and sales instead of traditional search.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Retailers could see up to a 520% increase in traffic from chatbots and AI prompts in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the report. For brands, that means figuring out how to show up in AI-generated recommendations, and fast.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This surge in AI-driven traffic is the bet behind <a href=\"https://promptingcompany.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Prompting Company</a>, a YC-backed startup helping products get mentioned in AI apps through GEO (generative engine optimization), a strategy designed for a future where AI agents browse the internet on users’ behalf.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The four-month-old startup, founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinnicholaschandra/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kevin Chandra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-marcelline/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michelle Marcelline</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertputrapurnama/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Albert Punama</a>, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding and already counts Rippling, Rho, Motion, Vapi, Fondo, Kernel, and Traceloop as customers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over the past year, most of the growth on websites has come from AI bots, not people,” co-founder and CEO Chandra told TechCrunch in an interview. “We’re already seeing developers ask AI tools for product recommendations inside their workflows, and we think people, over time, will be less involved in parts of the purchasing funnel.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI becomes the first touchpoint for product discovery and agents eventually transact on a user’s behalf, The Prompting Company believes brands must learn how to market<strong> </strong>to agents as well as humans.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What that means, according to Chandra, is that brands will need an AI-facing website, a version of their site made for agents without navigation bars, pop-ups, or marketing fluff. “Most businesses still design websites only for humans,” Chandra told TechCrunch. “But the fastest-growing segment of users on the internet today is AI agents and they need a completely different interface.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

It then creates structured content that answers those questions and automatically routes AI agents to “AI-optimized pages.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Y Combinator-backed startup helps companies publish thousands of AI-friendly pages so LLMs can cite their answers even when they don’t rank in traditional SEO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While SEO still matters, Chandra argues that GEO is quickly becoming the priority for brands. In GEO, product results surface organically based on relevance to the conversation, not paid keywords or search rankings.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift may also change how people buy products. Emerging protocols, including Google’s Agent-to-Agent framework and OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe, could further accelerate adoption by allowing AI agents to browse and complete purchases on behalf of users, moving them from discovery to transaction.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Imagine you’re a large e-commerce store. Users can buy items, make returns, compare products, or search for promotions. We help our customers expose those actions to AI agents. Right now, these agents aren’t yet clicking those options or accessing APIs directly, but we expect that to change in the coming months,” said Chandra. “Once that becomes widespread and attribution improves, we see a path toward more advertising- or conversion-driven models. For now, we’re focused on helping companies get discovered and recommended by AI.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, The Prompting Company serves mostly fintech, developer tools, and enterprise SaaS customers. The team says a Fortune 10 company is also using its product, for which it currently hosts about half a million pages. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, traffic driven to client sites is in the double-digit millions per month. The Prompting Company uses a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of prompts tracked and pages hosted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s founders, Indonesian immigrants who met as freshmen, previously built YC-backed <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/typedream\" rel=\"nofollow\">Typedream</a> (YC W20), a startup that allowed users to build and launch websites in minutes with AI, before Lovable and newer entrants took off (beehiiv acquired Typedream last June). </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders also built Cotter, a passwordless authentication SDK that was acquired by Stytch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With The Prompting Company, they’re trying to change how people discover and purchase products in the AI era.  The seed money, raised from Peak XV Partners, Base10, Y Combinator, Firedrop, and angels, including Logan Kilpatrick, will help the company scale its platform and partnerships as AI-powered discovery becomes the new distribution channel.

This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp’s backup.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, WhatsApp didn’t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/whatsapp-encrypt-cloud-backup/\">end-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys</a>. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don’t need to look for the password or the key. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp, which crossed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/whatsapp-now-has-more-than-3-billion-users/\">3 billion active users in May</a>, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a check on when it becomes available to you.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can go to <em>Settings &gt; Chats &gt; Chat backup &gt; End-to-end encrypted backup</em> to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">IntrCity SmartBus, a tech-enabled intercity bus platform in India, has raised $30 million in funding to expand its network across smaller cities and towns in the South Asian nation. The all-equity Series D round, led by A91 Partners, values the Noida-based startup at $140 million post-money.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intercity travel is accelerating in India as more people migrate from smaller towns to metropolitan cities for work and education.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To meet this demand, New Delhi has significantly expanded the country’s highway infrastructure. The national highway network has <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=154624&amp;ModuleId=3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">increased by over 60%</a> in the past decade, from 56,723 miles to 90,847 miles, according to Indian government data. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Railways, while extensive, remain capacity-constrained and cannot keep pace with rising inter-state travel demand. That makes long-distance road travel a crucial alternative. Yet, state-run intercity bus services are limited and often fall short on reliability and comfort — a gap <a href=\"https://www.intrcity.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IntrCity SmartBus</a> aims to fill.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional operators, IntrCity SmartBus runs on an asset-light model by partnering with local bus owners and equipping their vehicles with proprietary hardware for real-time tracking, co-founder and president Kapil Raizada said in an interview.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also centralizes ticket booking and route planning through its digital platform, which helps determine service frequency, pickup points, boarding stations, and even seat configurations based on demand.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To ensure safety and consistency, IntrCity places trained personnel — called “captains” — on board each bus, Raizada told TechCrunch. Most vehicles feature washrooms, and the company has also set up air-conditioned boarding lounges staffed with crew to improve the pre-departure experience.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

That entry point gave the team early insights into intercity travel behavior and unmet demand in road-based mobility, Raizada said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, RailYatri contributes just around 10% of the startup’s total revenue, while the SmartBus business accounts for the remaining 90%, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IntrCity SmartBus operates around 600 daily bus trips, transporting between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers each day — nearly 700,000 per month. The platform works with more than 50 local bus operators and runs trips averaging over 311 miles each. About 95% of its services are overnight, catering primarily to non-discretionary travel needs such as work, education, or essential appointments. <br/></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s typical passengers are between 20 and 45 years old, including small business owners, trainers, government officials, sales professionals, and students.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup follows a hub-and-spoke model and has identified 15 to 16 key economic hubs across India. It operates in 13 to 14 of these hubs, spanning 15 states. The network covers all of northern India — from Jammu to Uttarakhand — and much of the south, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A lot of data crunching goes into understanding what the consumer needs,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and CEO of IntrCity SmartBus. “This includes decisions like what kind of layout a bus should have — should it be a full sleeper, or a hybrid with both sleepers and seats?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IntrCity SmartBus grew its revenue by 67% year-over-year to ₹5 billion (approximately $57 million) in the last fiscal year. The startup projects revenue to surpass ₹7 billion (around $79 million) in the current year. It has been “EBITDA-positive” for the past couple of years and aims to become fully profitable this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest funding, the startup plans to go “deeper and wider” through the country and enhance customer experience and safety, as well as upgrade its fleet management technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the bigger challenges in in bus mobility across the country that people have concerns about busses. It is seen as a lesser cousin to trains and flights,” Raizada told TechCrunch. “We want to make busses the preferred mode of travel in India.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 223 million intercity journeys were made in India in the financial year 2025, according to a <a href=\"https://travel.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/research-and-statistics/research/redbus-reports-record-223-million-intercity-journeys-in-fy25-revealing-travel-trends-and-innovations/121947964\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recent report</a> by online bus ticketing platform RedBus. The sector added over 72,000 new intercity routes last year, along with approximately 6,400 new buses — expanding capacity by an estimated 265,000 daily seats.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside IntrCity SmartBus, India is seeing a wave of new-age intercity bus startups such as ZingBus, LeafyBus, and FreshBus. European giant FlixBus also <a href=\"https://corporate.flix.com/press_releases/flix-launches-bus-services-in-india-continuing-its-growth-path/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">entered the Indian market</a> early last year, signaling growing traction in the space. Still, IntrCity views competition as secondary to execution.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India is a very different beast when it comes to road travel. If something is going to go wrong, it will go wrong,” Rathi said. “We’re not a network-first company. We’re an operational-excellence-first company.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">India’s appetite for instant convenience — once confined to food and grocery delivery — is expanding into house help. That shift has helped <a href=\"https://snabbit.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Snabbit</a>, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/lightspeed-backs-indian-home-services-startup-snabbit-as-the-next-big-consumer-trend/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$80 million</a> five months ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The all-equity Series C round — Snabbit’s third fundraise in nine months — was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup’s total funding to $55 million.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit’s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"1920\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Snabbit founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal with a few of its women experts</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Snabbit</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of Snabbit’s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. “We’re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, ‘Hey, this was happening offline, and now we’ll do it online’,” said Agarwal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup reports a 30–35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of “well below” ₹500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit’s services are priced at around ₹150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around ₹240 (roughly $3).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Workers on the platform earn between ₹25,000–₹30,000 (approximately $284–$340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such as <a href=\"https://broomees.com/broomit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Broomees</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/prontos-10-minute-house-help-pitch-sparked-a-3-6x-valuation-jump-in-just-90-days/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pronto</a>. Urban Company now plans to <a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/indias-urban-company-plans-big-051646277.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">double down on instant home services</a> to stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a hyper-local business, you don’t win pan India, you don’t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,” Agarwal said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elderly care.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Cluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: you should be thinking harder about how to go viral.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at Disrupt 2025.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/startups-launch-products-to-catch-people-using-ai-cheating-app-cluely/\">a string of proctoring services</a> showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/cluely-a-startup-that-helps-cheat-on-everything-raises-15m-from-a16z/\">raised $15 million from Andressen Horowitz</a>, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">NBA champion Tristan Thompson announced at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/techcrunch-disrupt-2025-day-3/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> that he’s partnering with global telecom company World Mobile to launch a community-owned mobile network called Uplift. The network offers unlimited data plans starting at $9.99 per month. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uplift is built on blockchain technology and a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as “AirNode operators” will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage. The idea behind Uplift is to challenge the $2 trillion telecom industry’s centralized model by allowing users and local operators to share in the value they create.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For me, it’s about, how can I help people that have walked the same life that I walked, and I think for us, what we’re doing is providing connectivity and connection for unlimited data at a way lower cost,” Thompson said on stage. “It’s like, how can I help my community have a better tomorrow? And that’s what this is about. And I’ve been very blessed and fortunate to have a team that understands this vision. And we want to help people in America, help the inner city, and just give people hope.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Thompson is known for his basketball career and winning the NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he’s also an outspoken advocate for innovation and inclusion. Thompson currently holds four C-suite roles across the Web3 and fintech landscape. He’s the chief digital equity officer at World Mobile and the chief advisory officer at <a href=\"https://www.axondao.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AxonDAO</a>, an AI-powered medical research platform inspired by his brother’s epilepsy journey. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063921\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg 3942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244055206.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Getty Images for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s also the co-founder of Basketball Fun, a Web3 platform that tokenizes NBA players, and the chief content officer at Tracy AI, an AI platform for real-time sports analytics.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this latest endeavor, Thompson and World Mobile are looking to drive affordable community-owned internet access. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Uplift operates on infrastructure already proven through World Mobile’s U.S. deployments, World Mobile says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We brought about 20% of Reno back to connectivity,” Thompson said. “When the hurricane happened in North Carolina and Asheville, Starlink went out there and try to bring connectivity, and they weren’t able to, so they reached out to the World Mobile team, and we were able to get out there and send a couple of our guys on helicopters to fly in, and we were actually the ones that brought connectivity back to Asheville, North Carolina during that hurricane.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new service will begin rolling out in Cleveland, Ohio, soon, and will launch in additional cities in 2026.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">World Mobile notes that more than 50 million Americans live at or near the poverty line, with many lacking access to affordable high-speed data. Uplift aims to expand access while ensuring that wealth generated by mobile usage stays in the neighborhoods that create it.</p>\n</div>",
