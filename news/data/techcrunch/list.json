This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp’s backup.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, WhatsApp didn’t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/whatsapp-encrypt-cloud-backup/\">end-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys</a>. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don’t need to look for the password or the key. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp, which crossed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/whatsapp-now-has-more-than-3-billion-users/\">3 billion active users in May</a>, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a check on when it becomes available to you.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can go to <em>Settings &gt; Chats &gt; Chat backup &gt; End-to-end encrypted backup</em> to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">IntrCity SmartBus, a tech-enabled intercity bus platform in India, has raised $30 million in funding to expand its network across smaller cities and towns in the South Asian nation. The all-equity Series D round, led by A91 Partners, values the Noida-based startup at $140 million post-money.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intercity travel is accelerating in India as more people migrate from smaller towns to metropolitan cities for work and education.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To meet this demand, New Delhi has significantly expanded the country’s highway infrastructure. The national highway network has <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=154624&amp;ModuleId=3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">increased by over 60%</a> in the past decade, from 56,723 miles to 90,847 miles, according to Indian government data. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Railways, while extensive, remain capacity-constrained and cannot keep pace with rising inter-state travel demand. That makes long-distance road travel a crucial alternative. Yet, state-run intercity bus services are limited and often fall short on reliability and comfort — a gap <a href=\"https://www.intrcity.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IntrCity SmartBus</a> aims to fill.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional operators, IntrCity SmartBus runs on an asset-light model by partnering with local bus owners and equipping their vehicles with proprietary hardware for real-time tracking, co-founder and president Kapil Raizada said in an interview.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also centralizes ticket booking and route planning through its digital platform, which helps determine service frequency, pickup points, boarding stations, and even seat configurations based on demand.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To ensure safety and consistency, IntrCity places trained personnel — called “captains” — on board each bus, Raizada told TechCrunch. Most vehicles feature washrooms, and the company has also set up air-conditioned boarding lounges staffed with crew to improve the pre-departure experience.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

That entry point gave the team early insights into intercity travel behavior and unmet demand in road-based mobility, Raizada said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, RailYatri contributes just around 10% of the startup’s total revenue, while the SmartBus business accounts for the remaining 90%, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IntrCity SmartBus operates around 600 daily bus trips, transporting between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers each day — nearly 700,000 per month. The platform works with more than 50 local bus operators and runs trips averaging over 311 miles each. About 95% of its services are overnight, catering primarily to non-discretionary travel needs such as work, education, or essential appointments. <br/></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s typical passengers are between 20 and 45 years old, including small business owners, trainers, government officials, sales professionals, and students.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup follows a hub-and-spoke model and has identified 15 to 16 key economic hubs across India. It operates in 13 to 14 of these hubs, spanning 15 states. The network covers all of northern India — from Jammu to Uttarakhand — and much of the south, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A lot of data crunching goes into understanding what the consumer needs,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and CEO of IntrCity SmartBus. “This includes decisions like what kind of layout a bus should have — should it be a full sleeper, or a hybrid with both sleepers and seats?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IntrCity SmartBus grew its revenue by 67% year-over-year to ₹5 billion (approximately $57 million) in the last fiscal year. The startup projects revenue to surpass ₹7 billion (around $79 million) in the current year. It has been “EBITDA-positive” for the past couple of years and aims to become fully profitable this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest funding, the startup plans to go “deeper and wider” through the country and enhance customer experience and safety, as well as upgrade its fleet management technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the bigger challenges in in bus mobility across the country that people have concerns about busses. It is seen as a lesser cousin to trains and flights,” Raizada told TechCrunch. “We want to make busses the preferred mode of travel in India.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 223 million intercity journeys were made in India in the financial year 2025, according to a <a href=\"https://travel.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/research-and-statistics/research/redbus-reports-record-223-million-intercity-journeys-in-fy25-revealing-travel-trends-and-innovations/121947964\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recent report</a> by online bus ticketing platform RedBus. The sector added over 72,000 new intercity routes last year, along with approximately 6,400 new buses — expanding capacity by an estimated 265,000 daily seats.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside IntrCity SmartBus, India is seeing a wave of new-age intercity bus startups such as ZingBus, LeafyBus, and FreshBus. European giant FlixBus also <a href=\"https://corporate.flix.com/press_releases/flix-launches-bus-services-in-india-continuing-its-growth-path/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">entered the Indian market</a> early last year, signaling growing traction in the space. Still, IntrCity views competition as secondary to execution.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India is a very different beast when it comes to road travel. If something is going to go wrong, it will go wrong,” Rathi said. “We’re not a network-first company. We’re an operational-excellence-first company.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">India’s appetite for instant convenience — once confined to food and grocery delivery — is expanding into house help. That shift has helped <a href=\"https://snabbit.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Snabbit</a>, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/lightspeed-backs-indian-home-services-startup-snabbit-as-the-next-big-consumer-trend/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$80 million</a> five months ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The all-equity Series C round — Snabbit’s third fundraise in nine months — was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup’s total funding to $55 million.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit’s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snabbit-founder.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"1920\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Snabbit founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal with a few of its women experts</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Snabbit</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of Snabbit’s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. “We’re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, ‘Hey, this was happening offline, and now we’ll do it online’,” said Agarwal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup reports a 30–35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of “well below” ₹500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit’s services are priced at around ₹150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around ₹240 (roughly $3).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Workers on the platform earn between ₹25,000–₹30,000 (approximately $284–$340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such as <a href=\"https://broomees.com/broomit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Broomees</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/prontos-10-minute-house-help-pitch-sparked-a-3-6x-valuation-jump-in-just-90-days/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pronto</a>. Urban Company now plans to <a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/indias-urban-company-plans-big-051646277.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">double down on instant home services</a> to stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a hyper-local business, you don’t win pan India, you don’t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,” Agarwal said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elderly care.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Cluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: you should be thinking harder about how to go viral.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at Disrupt 2025.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/startups-launch-products-to-catch-people-using-ai-cheating-app-cluely/\">a string of proctoring services</a> showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/cluely-a-startup-that-helps-cheat-on-everything-raises-15m-from-a16z/\">raised $15 million from Andressen Horowitz</a>, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, however, Lee demurred. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said.“I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”</p>\n</div>",

The network offers unlimited data plans starting at $9.99 per month. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uplift is built on blockchain technology and a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as “AirNode operators” will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage. The idea behind Uplift is to challenge the $2 trillion telecom industry’s centralized model by allowing users and local operators to share in the value they create.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For me, it’s about, how can I help people that have walked the same life that I walked, and I think for us, what we’re doing is providing connectivity and connection for unlimited data at a way lower cost,” Thompson said on stage. “It’s like, how can I help my community have a better tomorrow?

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">“The dead internet theory is real,” Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian told Digg founder Kevin Rose, referring to the idea that much of the internet isn’t human — it’s mostly bots. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two entrepreneurs have since teamed up to re-envision how to build a social community in this world where, very soon, it will be hard to tell who’s a real person online. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the two <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/kevin-rose-and-alexis-ohanian-acquire-digg/\">bought the remaining assets belonging to Digg</a>, the long-shuttered news aggregation site originally founded by Rose that was a staple of the Web 2.0 era. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now again under Rose’s control, the new Digg is creating a place for people to socialize and connect online within communities, similar to Reddit, but it has different ideas about how such a platform should work at a time when bots are nearly indistinguishable from humans. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday, Rose explained that he sees the future of social as being more focused on protected online spaces and “micro communities of trusted users.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just have to imagine that, as the cost to deploy agents drops to next to nothing, we’re just gonna see…bots act as though they’re humans,” he said. “So, small trusted communities, proof of heartbeat — there’s an actual human on the other end…is important.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But today’s verification methods often involve things like facial recognition, ID uploads, or small payments with a credit card to ensure that someone is a person and not a bot. Not everyone online will feel comfortable doing something like that to access an online social community, of course.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Digg is looking to use newer technology, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof\" rel=\"nofollow\">a ZK proof</a> (ZKP) to verify people using its platform in the future. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Says Rose, the ZKP is a “fancy piece of math” which doesn’t expose who someone is, but can verify something essential that would be important for their participation in an online community. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, a moderator of a community for Oura ring owners could use the technology to verify that someone is actually an Oura ring owner before allowing them to post. That identity could stay with them so they’re known as a trusted member, but not necessarily one where they have to go by their real name. This could be particularly useful in communities focused on sensitive topics or health issues, as well. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063915\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg 4176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2244048705.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Connie Loizos, Editor-in-Chief and Kevin Rose, Founder of Digg.

You can’t capture any email addresses. You can’t stay in touch on that platform. You can be ousted [from] that platform,” he said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rose also pointed to issues where larger Reddit communities can become trademarked — something that prevented the founder of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit from writing a book using the name of the community they had created. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If anything, we should be more similar to Substack or Patreon, or some others that are actually giving you much more control of your community,” he said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is a big fan of agentic coding",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The rise of agentic coding tools has been a sea change for software engineers across the industry — but for Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, it seems to have landed particularly hard. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Yakovenko said he’s become increasingly comfortable taking a backseat in software development tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI has been a great force multiplier for somebody who’s an expert,” said Yakovenko, describing his experience with agentic coding after more than fifteen years developing software. “Now I can just watch Claude churning through its thing and I can almost smell when it’s going off the rails.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If people are in a meeting with me and I’m not paying attention,” he continued, “it’s because I’m watching Claude.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-founder of the Solana cryptocurrency protocol, Yakovenko has seen immense success this year, even as many cryptocurrencies have struggled. The system announced <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-pulls-2-85b-annual-112115927.html\">$2.85 billion in annual revenue</a> earlier this month, fueled largely by crypto trading platforms. Even more impressive was the Solana coin’s first exchange-traded fund (or ETF), launched the day before Yakovenko took the stage. Launched by the crypto asset manager Bitwise, the fund saw <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/69-5m-in-a-day-is-bitwises-solana-etf-the-new-crypto-favorite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly $70 million of inflows</a> in a single day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On stage, Yakovenko attributed the success to a growing acceptance of crypto, especially from the conventional finance industry. “If you are a back-office finance person, you actually get crypto much much faster,” Yakovenko said. “Finance people deal with settlement risk all the time. They deal with banking risk all the time.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the same period, cryptocurrency has drawn significant new criticism for enabling public bribery, particularly in connection with the Solana-hosted Trumpcoin. The coin has directed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb1def8f-53a6-478e-9b3e-33c383b29629\" rel=\"nofollow\">an estimated $350 million to the president</a>, which critics see as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/business/crypto-mogul-trump-coins-civil-fraud-charges\" rel=\"nofollow\">a form of bribery</a> — particularly in the wake of Trump’s high-profile pardons for Tron founder Justin Sun and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/pardon-of-cz-how-binance-founder-aided-trump-family-crypto-venture\" rel=\"nofollow\">Binance founder Changpeng Zhao</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as long as Solana is an open protocol, Yakovenko has little control over the coins it hosts. “I could send you an email with a link to Trumpcoin or Fartcoin,” Yakovenko explained on stage, “and both of those are protocols, both the email and the underlying protocol that creates that market.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
