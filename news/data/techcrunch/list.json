Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" rel=\"nofollow\">believes</a> it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday at 5:01 PM <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-wont-budge-as-pentagon-escalates-ai-dispute/\">deadline</a> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">attempted to force Amodei’s hand</a> by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan Thursday. The social media exec was seen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/style/mark-zuckerberg-prada-milan-fashion-week.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">chatting with his seatmate</a>, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s Chief Merchandising Officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/mark-zuckerbergs-makeover-midlife-crisis-or-carefully-crafted-rebrand/\">with upgraded threads</a>, it’s likely that the social media exec wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/meta-oakley-prada-smart-glasses-luxottica.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC had reported</a> last summer that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/meta-is-reportedly-building-ai-smart-glasses-with-prada-too/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Prada AI glasses were in the works</a>, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.) </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Surprise guests at Prada <a href=\"https://t.co/BPHqLo9oaW\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW</a></p>— Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VVFriedman/status/2027026036882309609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script tcembed--twitter\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-triples-sales-of-meta-ai-glasses.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025</a>, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">Oakley Meta</a> glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. That deal started at the beginning of this year and runs through December 31, 2030, the December 2024 <a href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/prada-group-essilorluxottica-ten-years-licensing-renewal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a> noted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet address. Being able to establish the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall, as well. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash to surveillance devices, which have recently led people to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r2mbjs/why_are_people_disconnecting_or_destroying_their/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rip out</a> their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/14/doorbell-cameras-ring-nancy-guthrie-super-bowl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ring doorbells</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/americans-are-destroying-flock-surveillance-cameras/\">smash Flock cameras</a>.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s cold in space…[but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to to dissipate is through conduction,” NVidia CEO Jensen Huang when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob Demillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monin — have a different approach.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to the Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for the Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/space-based-solar-power-startup-aetherflux-enters-orbital-data-center-race/\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar realization</a>.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sophia, an NVidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are one meter by one meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, Demillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Demillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical, and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include earth observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” Demillo told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest dip in more than a decade.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, IDC said that manufacturers shipped <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/press-releases/q425mobilephonetop5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.26 billion devices in 2025</a>. The firm predicts that the volume will dip to only 1.12 billion this year. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping long‑term TAM (Total Addressable Market), the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, said in a statement. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097553\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"680\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=50,50 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: IDC</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Popal said that because of memory shortage, the average selling price of a smartphone is supposed to rise by 14%. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, Smartphone ASP is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she mentioned. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm said that, because of this trend, the Middle East and Africa will face shipments dropping over 20% year-over-year.

The “more specs for less money” model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei noted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

Now, AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture <a href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2026/accenture-and-mistral-ai-accelerate-enterprise-reinvention-with-scalable-ai-that-delivers-strategic-autonomy-for-customers\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced a multi-year partnership</a>. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/anthropic-and-accenture-sign-multi-year-ai-strategic-partnership/\">deals with Accenture</a>, as well.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/openai-calls-in-the-consultants-for-its-enterprise-push/\">“Frontier Alliance”</a> initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI Frontier</a> AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-and-ibm-announce-strategic-partnership/\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/deloitte-goes-all-in-on-ai-despite-having-to-issue-a-hefty-refund-for-use-of-ai/\">Deloitte</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ada can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada , can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIeqR_VpeH8?feature=oembed\" title=\"Meet Ada: Your Digital Twin\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (Model Context Protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which has raised over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\">$81 million in funding</a>, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched <a href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/read-ai-launches-search-copilot-an-industry-first-ai-tool-for-cross-platform-search-and-discovery--at-no-cost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Search Copilot</a> for knowledge discovery for users, and last month, it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send a custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based <a href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/search-copilot-actions-building-workflows-that-work-for-you\" rel=\"nofollow\">on internal and web knowledge</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ai-note-taking-app-granola-adds-a-repeatable-prompts-feature/\">“recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts</a> to surface knowledge from meeting data. <a href=\"https://www.quillmeetings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quill</a>, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.einride.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Einride</a> has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-plans-to-go-public-via-a-spac/\">public debut</a> that’s expected for the first half of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Swedish startup is most well-known for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">building both electric trucks and autonomous pods</a> that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States, and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">$100 million previously announced</a> crossover financing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses. Though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/\">public via a SPAC merger</a> valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/techcrunch-mobility-self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-goes-public-and-a-shake-up-at-hyundais-supernal/\">SPAC road</a> to the public market in 2025.</p>\n</div>",
