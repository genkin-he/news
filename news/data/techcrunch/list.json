            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">After years of appeals, Google has finally received conditional approval to export high-precision geographic information out of South Korea, a move that opens the door to let the company provide proper Google Maps services in the country, such as walking and real-time driving directions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reverses a long-standing policy on data restrictions that had essentially made Google Maps and Apple Maps non-functional in the country. Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data.  Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The green light comes with <a href=\"https://www.molit.go.kr/USR/NEWS/m_72/dtl.jsp?id=95091751\" rel=\"nofollow\">strict rules</a> designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/c/google/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">an array of data centers</a> in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/ultrahuman-ring-air-review/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ring Air</a> — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ruled in Oura’s favor</a> in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August 2025, Ultrahuman also <a href=\"https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/ultrahuman-files-patent-infringement-suit-against-oura/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">filed a separate patent infringement case</a> against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It <a href=\"https://cyborg.ultrahuman.com/press-releases/ultrahuman-delivers-record-fy25-profits-as-subscription-engine-accelerates\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reported $64 million</a> in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Separate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months.</p>\n</div>",

Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/netflix-submits-amended-all-cash-offer-warner-bros-wins-board-support-2026-01-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">all-cash bid</a> for the legacy studio, and <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">would walk away from the deal</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103282/cbs-chief-bari-weiss-pulls-60-minutes-story\" rel=\"nofollow\">shelved</a> or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix had announced its intent to <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquire</a> WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Dorsey <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-to-lay-off-4-000-employees-in-ai-remake-28f0d869\" rel=\"nofollow\">half</a> its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.” Salesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of companies that have made <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">enormous</a> staffing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cuts</a> citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-impact-ai-jobs-forecast/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cast some doubt</a> on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" rel=\"nofollow\">believes</a> it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday at 5:01 PM <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-wont-budge-as-pentagon-escalates-ai-dispute/\">deadline</a> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">attempted to force Amodei’s hand</a> by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan Thursday. The social media exec was seen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/style/mark-zuckerberg-prada-milan-fashion-week.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">chatting with his seatmate</a>, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s Chief Merchandising Officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/mark-zuckerbergs-makeover-midlife-crisis-or-carefully-crafted-rebrand/\">with upgraded threads</a>, it’s likely that the social media exec wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/meta-oakley-prada-smart-glasses-luxottica.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC had reported</a> last summer that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/meta-is-reportedly-building-ai-smart-glasses-with-prada-too/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Prada AI glasses were in the works</a>, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.) </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Surprise guests at Prada <a href=\"https://t.co/BPHqLo9oaW\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW</a></p>— Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VVFriedman/status/2027026036882309609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script tcembed--twitter\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-triples-sales-of-meta-ai-glasses.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025</a>, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">Oakley Meta</a> glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. That deal started at the beginning of this year and runs through December 31, 2030, the December 2024 <a href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/prada-group-essilorluxottica-ten-years-licensing-renewal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a> noted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet address. Being able to establish the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall, as well. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash to surveillance devices, which have recently led people to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r2mbjs/why_are_people_disconnecting_or_destroying_their/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rip out</a> their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/14/doorbell-cameras-ring-nancy-guthrie-super-bowl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ring doorbells</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/americans-are-destroying-flock-surveillance-cameras/\">smash Flock cameras</a>. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether or not it will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/meta-plans-to-add-facial-recognition-to-its-smart-glasses-report-claims/\">add facial recognition</a> features to its glasses, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The New York Times</a> recently reported.
