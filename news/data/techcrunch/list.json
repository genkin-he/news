            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company <a href=\"https://x.com/supabase/status/2026374754438087119\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledging the issue</a> in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/indian-government-censorsht/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">access to developer platform GitHub</a>, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/github-content-domain-blocked-for-these-indian-users-reports/articleshow/96687992.cms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/vibe-coding-helps-supabase-nab-200m-at-2b-valuation-just-seven-months-after-its-last-raise/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gained traction</a> amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/supabase-nabs-5b-valuation-four-months-after-hitting-2b/\">valuation to $5 billion</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond.</p>\n</div>",

However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/an-accountant-won-a-big-jackpot-on-kalshi-by-betting-against-doge/\">an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi </a>by betting against DOGE believers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms.

            "title": "Musk bashes OpenAI in deposition, saying ‘nobody committed suicide because of Grok’",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety.  He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comment came up in a line of questioning about a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/1100-notable-signatories-just-signed-an-open-letter-asking-all-ai-labs-to-immediately-pause-for-at-least-6-months/\">public letter</a> Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a <a href=\"https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-tech-justice-law-project-lawsuits-accuse-chatgpt-of-emotional-manipulation-supercharging-ai-delusions-and-acting-as-a-suicide-coach/\" rel=\"nofollow\">series of lawsuits</a> alleging that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics</a> have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/elon-musk-openai-sam-altman-court/\">lawsuit</a> against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\">Musk claims violated</a> its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own, however. Last month, Musk’s social network X was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">flooded with non-consensual nude images</a> generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">were said to be of minors</a>. This led the California Attorney General’s office to <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">open an investigation</a> into the matter. The EU is also <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/musks-grok-chatbot-faces-eu-privacy-investigation-over-sexualized-deepfake-images\" rel=\"nofollow\">running its own investigation</a>, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted to — AI safety to be prioritized.” …</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?w=500\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sure-jan-elon.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" style=\"width:370px;height:auto\" width=\"500\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>imgflip</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI —  the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/\">supposed $100 million donation</a> to OpenAI; the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/170/musk-v-altman/\" rel=\"nofollow\">second amended complaint</a> in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The past two weeks have been defined by a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">clash</a> between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/\">Amodei publicly signaled</a> that Anthropic isn’t backing down – despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-anthropic-worried-about\"><strong>What is Anthropic worried about?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no human in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons.The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a <a href=\"https://www.esd.whs.mil/portals/54/documents/dd/issuances/dodd/300009p.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023 DOD directive</a>, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as ‘lawful use.’</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high stakes calls.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-the-pentagon-want\"><strong>What does the Pentagon want?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thursday X post</a> that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Anthropic has until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the Department’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times  seemed connected to cultural grievance. In <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4377190/remarks-by-secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-at-spacex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January</a>, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-now\"><strong>So what now?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01pm on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DOD, it could be a national security issue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second- or third-best.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2027294561467613256\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elon Musk’s rhetoric </a>on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DOD total control over its technology. Recent <a href=\"https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/\">settled its lawsuit</a> and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard.

Fans have also honed in on a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-winds-waves-cloud-legendary-gyarados-theories-trailer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">suspicious-looking cloud</a> in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly ten years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"bluesky-embed\" data-bluesky-cid=\"bafyreie3rgahsrfq6o2jgmgzjiayu7h27gdpj2jcsyatghr2mlcyn3lnle\" data-bluesky-uri=\"at://did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/app.bsky.feed.post/3mftx5zaug22f\"><p lang=\"pt\">pokémon white lotus</p>— <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y?ref_src=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">stanley tucci da grande sp (@fullofentulho.bsky.social)</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/post/3mftx5zaug22f?ref_src=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">2026-02-27T14:44:57.713Z</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script\" src=\"https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Main series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region… but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/\">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>” came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the “Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen” games today for the Switch… but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/\">extremely easy and legally dubious</a> way to get those games on your phone for free. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Hkq2C4Wr9rhr0OV9hOfNI4oA4y?domain=perplexity.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">example workflows</a> on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097675\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg 3799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1200,621 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1280,663 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=430,223 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=720,373 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=900,466 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=800,414 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1536,795 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=2048,1060 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=668,346 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1192,617 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=708,367 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.</p>\n</div>",
