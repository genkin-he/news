Recent examples include Stripe, which this week said it would allow employees to sell shares at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/stripes-valuation-soars-74-to-159-billion/\">$159 billion valuation</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/secondary-sales-shift-from-founder-windfalls-to-employee-retention-tools/\">Clay</a>, <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender\" rel=\"nofollow\">ElevenLabs</a>, and <a href=\"https://linear.app/now/giving-our-team-liquidity-through-linear-s-first-tender-offer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linear</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond retention, these deals can help staff cover tax bills triggered when RSUs vest and relieve pressure on management to pursue an IPO before the company is ready.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

Discovery is over. David Ellison-owned Paramount will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery <a href=\"https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Determines-Revised-Proposal-from-Paramount-Skydance-Constitutes-a-Company-Superior-Proposal/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/netflix-submits-amended-all-cash-offer-warner-bros-wins-board-support-2026-01-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">all-cash bid</a> for the legacy studio, and <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">would walk away from the deal</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103282/cbs-chief-bari-weiss-pulls-60-minutes-story\" rel=\"nofollow\">shelved</a> or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix had announced its intent to <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquire</a> WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Dorsey <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-to-lay-off-4-000-employees-in-ai-remake-28f0d869\" rel=\"nofollow\">half</a> its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.” Salesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of companies that have made <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">enormous</a> staffing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cuts</a> citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-impact-ai-jobs-forecast/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cast some doubt</a> on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan Thursday. The social media exec was seen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/style/mark-zuckerberg-prada-milan-fashion-week.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">chatting with his seatmate</a>, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s Chief Merchandising Officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/mark-zuckerbergs-makeover-midlife-crisis-or-carefully-crafted-rebrand/\">with upgraded threads</a>, it’s likely that the social media exec wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/meta-oakley-prada-smart-glasses-luxottica.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC had reported</a> last summer that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/meta-is-reportedly-building-ai-smart-glasses-with-prada-too/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Prada AI glasses were in the works</a>, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.) </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Surprise guests at Prada <a href=\"https://t.co/BPHqLo9oaW\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW</a></p>— Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VVFriedman/status/2027026036882309609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"tcembed-script tcembed--twitter\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-triples-sales-of-meta-ai-glasses.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025</a>, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">Oakley Meta</a> glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. That deal started at the beginning of this year and runs through December 31, 2030, the December 2024 <a href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/prada-group-essilorluxottica-ten-years-licensing-renewal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a> noted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet address. Being able to establish the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall, as well. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash to surveillance devices, which have recently led people to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r2mbjs/why_are_people_disconnecting_or_destroying_their/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rip out</a> their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/14/doorbell-cameras-ring-nancy-guthrie-super-bowl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ring doorbells</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/americans-are-destroying-flock-surveillance-cameras/\">smash Flock cameras</a>.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s cold in space…[but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to to dissipate is through conduction,” NVidia CEO Jensen Huang when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob Demillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monin — have a different approach.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to the Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for the Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/space-based-solar-power-startup-aetherflux-enters-orbital-data-center-race/\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar realization</a>.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sophia, an NVidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are one meter by one meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, Demillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Demillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical, and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include earth observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” Demillo told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest dip in more than a decade.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, IDC said that manufacturers shipped <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/press-releases/q425mobilephonetop5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.26 billion devices in 2025</a>. The firm predicts that the volume will dip to only 1.12 billion this year. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping long‑term TAM (Total Addressable Market), the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, said in a statement. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097553\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"680\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chart-for-WW_Forecast_PR_4Q25.webp?resize=50,50 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: IDC</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Popal said that because of memory shortage, the average selling price of a smartphone is supposed to rise by 14%. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, Smartphone ASP is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she mentioned. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm said that, because of this trend, the Middle East and Africa will face shipments dropping over 20% year-over-year.

The “more specs for less money” model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei noted.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",
