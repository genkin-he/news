Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had invoked a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/\">national security law</a> —  one designed to counter foreign supply chain threats —  to blacklist the company from doing business with the Pentagon after Amodei refused to allow Anthropic’s tech to be used for mass surveillance of U.S. citizens or for autonomous armed drones that could select and kill targets without human input.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a jaw-dropping sequence. Anthropic is now set to lose a contract worth up to $200 million, as well as be barred from working with other defense contractors after President Trump posted on Truth Social directing every federal agency to “immediately cease all use of Anthropic technology.” (Anthropic has since said it will <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war\" rel=\"nofollow\">challenge the Pentagon in court</a>, calling the supply-chain-risk designation legally unsound and “never before publicly applied to an American company.”)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Max Tegmark has spent the better part of a decade warning that the race to build ever-more-powerful AI systems is outpacing the world’s ability to govern them. The Swedish-American physicist and professor at MIT founded the <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Future of Life Institute</a> in 2014. In 2023, he famously helped organize an <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\" rel=\"nofollow\">open letter</a> — ultimately signed by more than 33,000 people, including Elon Musk — calling for a pause in advanced AI development.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His view of the Anthropic crisis is unsparing: the company, like its rivals, has sown the seeds of its own predicament. Tegmark’s argument doesn’t begin with the Pentagon but with a decision made years earlier — a choice, shared across the industry, to resist binding regulation. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and others have long promised to govern themselves responsibly. Earlier this week, Anthropic even dropped the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-changing-safety-policy-2026-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">central tenet of its own safety pledge</a> — its promise not to release increasingly powerful AI systems until the company was confident they wouldn’t cause harm. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, in the absence of rules, there’s not a lot to protect these players, says Tegmark. Here’s more from that interview, edited for length and clarity. You can hear the full conversation this coming week on TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/76SeToo8Rxj8hRTE0iQwWZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">StrictlyVC Download</a> podcast.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>When you saw this news just now about Anthropic, what was your first reaction?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It’s so interesting to think back a decade ago, when people were so excited about how we were going to make artificial intelligence to cure cancer, to grow the prosperity in America and make America strong. And here we are now where the U.S. government is pissed off at this company for not wanting AI to be used for domestic mass surveillance of Americans, and also not wanting to have killer robots that can autonomously — without any human input at all — decide who gets killed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\"><em>Your next round.

Do you think that’s at all contradictory?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is contradictory. If I can give a little cynical take on this — yes, Anthropic has been very good at marketing themselves as all about safety. But if you actually look at the facts rather than the claims, what you see is that Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and xAI have all talked a lot about how they care about safety. None of them has come out supporting binding safety regulation the way we have in other industries. And all four of these companies have now broken their own promises. First we had Google — this big slogan, ‘Don’t be evil.’ Then they dropped that. Then they dropped another longer commitment that basically said they promised not to do harm with AI. They dropped that so they could sell AI for surveillance and weapons. OpenAI just dropped the word safety from their mission statement. xAI shut down their whole safety team. And now Anthropic, earlier in the week, dropped their most important safety commitment — the promise not to release powerful AI systems until they were sure they weren’t going to cause harm.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>How did companies that made such prominent safety commitments end up in this position?</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of these companies, especially OpenAI and Google DeepMind but to some extent also Anthropic, have persistently lobbied against regulation of AI, saying, ‘Just trust us, we’re going to regulate ourselves.’ And they’ve successfully lobbied. So we right now have less regulation on AI systems in America than on sandwiches. You know, if you want to open a sandwich shop and the health inspector finds 15 rats in the kitchen, he won’t let you sell any sandwiches until you fix it. But if you say, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell sandwiches, I’m going to sell AI girlfriends for 11-year-olds, and they’ve been linked to suicides in the past, and then I’m going to release something called superintelligence which might overthrow the U.S. government, but I have a good feeling about mine’ — the inspector has to say, ‘Fine, go ahead, just don’t sell sandwiches.’</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>There’s food safety regulation and no AI regulation.</strong><br/><br/>And this, I feel, all of these companies really share the blame for. Because if they had taken all these promises that they made back in the day for how they were going to be so safe and goody-goody, and gotten together, and then gone to the government and said, ‘Please take our voluntary commitments and turn them into U.S. law that binds even our most sloppy competitors’ — this would have happened instead. We’re in a complete regulatory vacuum. And we know what happens when there’s a complete corporate amnesty: you get <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/woman-who-stood-between-america-and-epidemic-birth-defects-180963165/\" rel=\"nofollow\">thalidomide</a>, you get tobacco companies pushing cigarettes on kids, you get asbestos causing lung cancer. So it’s sort of ironic that their own resistance to having laws saying what’s okay and not okay to do with AI is now coming back and biting them.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is no law right now against building AI to kill Americans, so the government can just suddenly ask for it. If the companies themselves had earlier come out and said, ‘We want this law,’ they wouldn’t be in this pickle. They really shot themselves in the foot.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The companies’ counter-argument is always the race with China — if American companies don’t do this, Beijing will. Does that argument hold?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s analyze that. The most common talking point from the lobbyists for the AI companies — they’re now better funded and more numerous than the lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry, the pharma industry and the military-industrial complex combined — is that whenever anyone proposes any kind of regulation, they say, ‘But China.’ So let’s look at that. China is in the process of banning AI girlfriends outright. Not just age limits — they’re looking at banning all anthropomorphic AI. Why? Not because they want to please America, but because they feel this is screwing up Chinese youth and making China weak. Obviously, it’s making American youth weak, too.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And when people say we have to race to build superintelligence so we can win against China — when we don’t actually know how to control superintelligence, so that the default outcome is that humanity loses control of Earth to alien machines — guess what? The Chinese Communist Party really likes control. Who in their right mind thinks that Xi Jinping is going to tolerate some Chinese AI company building something that overthrows the Chinese government? No way. It’s clearly really bad for the American government too if it gets overthrown in a coup by the first American company to build superintelligence. This is a national security threat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>That’s compelling framing — superintelligence as a national security threat, not an asset. Do you see that view gaining traction in Washington? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think if people in the national security community listen to Dario Amodei describe his vision — he’s given a famous speech where he says we’ll soon have a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bloombergtv/reel/DU7pjUciTlB/?hl=gu\" rel=\"nofollow\">country of geniuses in a data center </a>— they might start thinking: wait, did Dario just use the word ‘country’? Maybe I should put that country of geniuses in a data center on the same threat list I’m keeping tabs on, because that sounds threatening to the U.S. government. And I think fairly soon, enough people in the U.S. national security community are going to realize that uncontrollable superintelligence is a threat, not a tool. This is totally analogous to the Cold War. There was a race for dominance — economic and military — against the Soviet Union. We Americans won that one without ever engaging in the second race, which was to see who could put the most nuclear craters in the other superpower. People realized that was just suicide. No one wins. The same logic applies here.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What does all of this mean for the pace of AI development more broadly? How close do you think we are to the systems you’re describing?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Six years ago, almost every expert in AI I knew predicted we were decades away from having AI that could master language and knowledge at human level — maybe 2040, maybe 2050. They were all wrong, because we already have that now. We’ve seen AI progress quite rapidly from high school level to college level to PhD level to university professor level in some areas. Last year, AI won the gold medal at the International Mathematics Olympiad, which is about as difficult as human tasks get. I <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18212\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote a paper</a> together with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hendrycks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dan Hendrycks</a>, and other top AI researchers just a few months ago giving a rigorous definition of AGI. According to this, GPT-4 was 27% of the way there. GPT-5 was 57% of the way there. So we’re not there yet, but going from 27% to 57% that quickly suggests it might not be that long.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I lectured to my students yesterday at MIT, I told them that even if it takes four years, that means when they graduate, they might not be able to get any jobs anymore. It’s certainly not too soon to start preparing for it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthropic is now blacklisted. I’m curious to see what happens next — will the other AI giants stand with them and say, we won’t do this either? Or does someone like xAI raise their hand and say, Anthropic didn’t want that contract, we’ll take it?</strong> <strong>[Editor’s note: Hours after the interview, OpenAI announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/openais-sam-altman-announces-pentagon-deal-with-technical-safeguards/\">own deal</a> with the Pentagon.]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last night, Sam Altman came out and said he stands with Anthropic and has the same red lines. I admire him for the courage of saying that. Google, as of when we started this interview, had said nothing. If they just stay quiet, I think that’s incredibly embarrassing for them as a company, and a lot of their staff will feel the same. We haven’t heard anything from xAI yet either. So it’ll be interesting to see. Basically, there’s this moment where everybody has to show their true colors.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Is there a version of this where the outcome is actually good?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, and this is why I’m actually optimistic in a strange way. There’s such an obvious alternative here. If we just start treating AI companies like any other companies — drop the corporate amnesty — they would clearly have to do something like a clinical trial before they released something this powerful, and demonstrate to independent experts that they know how to control it. Then we get a golden age with all the good stuff from AI, without the existential angst. That’s not the path we’re on right now. But it could be.</p>\n</div>",

Discovery</a>, setting the stage for Paramount Skydance to win ownership of the Hollywood studio.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said that they were being financially disciplined.  Now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/how-david-ellison-outlasted-netflix-in-the-warner-bros-bidding-war\" rel=\"nofollow\">reporting in Bloomberg</a> offers more details about why Netflix executives backed down from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/warner-bros-netflix-paramount-acquisition-timeline-wbd/\">a bidding war that it seemed to win back in December</a>. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one thing, the streaming giant’s shareholders seemed unconvinced that buying a Hollywood studio was the right move — Netflix’s share price was down 30% since announcing the acquisition, while the subsequent announcement that it was backing down <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/business/media/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-analysts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sent Netflix stock up nearly 14%</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the time Sarandos met with Trump administration officials on Thursday, he may already have decided to concede. In fact, since Trump had previously warned him not to overpay, Sarandos reportedly told the president, “I took your advice.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, employees at Warner Bros. now worry about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/business/warner-bros-paramount-reaction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">major studio layoffs</a> and <a href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/17722120321108aa883dc7fda/raw\" rel=\"nofollow\">conservative political pressure on CNN</a>.</p>\n</div>",

Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood and the media business as we know it. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After years of Warner Bros.

Discovery’s assets, including its studios, HBO, streaming platforms, games, and TV networks such as CNN and HGTV. Paramount was itself recently acquired by Ellison with significant support from his father, the Oracle chairman, world’s sixth-richest person, and major Trump donor Larry Ellison.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount’s offer still awaits formal approval from WBD’s board of directors, and any potential agreement may also face pressure from regulators.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s break down exactly what is happening, what’s at stake, and what could come next. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-happened-so-far\">What has happened so far?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This all started back in October when Warner Bros.

Netflix offered $82.7 billion for just Warner’s film, television, and streaming assets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus began the bidding war. Paramount believed its bid, of approximately $108 billion for all of Warner’s assets, was superior to Netflix’s offer that focused on just the studios and streaming. To sweeten its deal, Netflix <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">amended its agreement</a> in January to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD</a>. Still, the Warner board repeatedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rejected</a> its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal, including concern over the suite of investors bankrolling Paramount’s bid, which includes Saudi, Qatari, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take at the time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-enhances-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer-for-warner-bros-discovery-and-provides-update-on-regulatory-progress-302683694.html?tc=eml_cleartime\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">announcing </a>it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Warner backs out of its deal with Netflix.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, in a final attempt to secure a deal, Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share in February. This prompted the WBD board to <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-board-directors-determines-revised-proposal-paramount-skydance\" rel=\"nofollow\">prolong discussions</a> with Paramount regarding a potential agreement, considering it as a superior offer. Netflix declined to increase its bid and withdrew from the negotiations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in a statement</a> on Feb. 26. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the billions Paramount already holds in debt, the company is also set to assume the approximately $33 billion in debt Warner Bros. Discovery holds <a href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-form-next-generation\" rel=\"nofollow\">under the agreement</a>.

There have already been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">widespread concerns among critics</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">about potential job losses</a> and lower wages.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison is also a controversial figure in the industry, and his ownership of CBS News has been seen as sympathetic and supportive of the administration of Donald Trump, of whom his father, Larry Ellison, is a major donor. Under Ellison’s ownership of Paramount, reporting critical of the administration has been shelved or received increased scrutiny from Ellison or his appointed head of CBS News, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has led to some concern among employees at Warner-owned CNN. Trump has personally sought concessions from news divisions critical of him, including a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-harris-minutes-paramount-6415042fe910ae60b432dd8c73ef61b2\" rel=\"nofollow\">$16 million settlement from CBS</a>, before his FCC <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/business/media/fcc-skydance-merger-paramount.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">would approve</a> the Ellison takeover of Paramount. Before Netflix bowed out of the deal, Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/trump-says-netflix-will-face-consequences-if-it-doesnt-fire-board-member-susan-rice/\">pressured the company</a> to fire the former Biden White House official Susan Rice from its board. He has publicly stated his intentions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/28/trump-paramount-skydance-warner-bros-cnn-netflix\" rel=\"nofollow\">bring CNN to heel</a> under new owners.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regulatory scrutiny is another hurdle. Such a large-scale merger has attracted attention from lawmakers. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, California Attorney General Rob Bonta <a href=\"https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/rob-bonta-california-ag-warn-paramount-warner-bros-1236674377/\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in a statement</a> on February 26 that “these two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A day before Netflix backed out, it was revealed that a <a href=\"https://dojmt.gov/attorney-general-knudsen-asks-usdoj-to-review-proposed-netflix-warner-brothers-merger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">coalition of 11 state attorneys general</a> urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the merger under concerns it will stifle competition and increase subscription prices. This comes months after U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal voiced <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division</a>, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Ellison’s father, the Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, is a significant Trump donor and has close ties to the Trump administration. His deal to acquire Paramount last year cleared quickly after acquiescing to c</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-is-the-deal-expected-to-close\">When is the deal expected to close?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is not yet final.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, a deal with Netflix was expected to lead to a stockholder vote around April, with the deal anticipated to close within 12 to 18 months following that vote. However, the transition to the Paramount deal will likely create a new timeline for approval. Plus, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stay tuned…</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-boom-far-over-after-tepid-sales-forecast-2025-08-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent earnings call</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-microsoft-s-2019-investment-in-openai\">Microsoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">In 2019</a>, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">in the form of Azure cloud credit</a> rather than cash. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. Last year, OpenAI announced it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/\">no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively</a>, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. Microsoft has also begun exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">making kernel-level modifications</a> on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/\">smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf</a> as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-171740706.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in September</a>, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-the-rise-of-oracle\">The rise of Oracle</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a spot alongside Google</a> as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners.

Oracle’s stock <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/why-the-oracle-openai-deal-caught-wall-street-by-surprise/\">climbed even higher</a>, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nvidia-s-investment-spree\">Nvidia’s investment spree</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, Nvidia bought <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-buys-5-billion-stake-in-intel-planning-ai-chip-collaboration/\">a 4% stake in rival Intel </a>for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a $100 billion investment in OpenAI</a>, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement</a> with AMD.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that seems circular, it’s because it is. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-building-tomorrow-s-hyperscale-data-centers\">Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For companies like Meta that already have <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/research/metas-hyperscale-infrastructure-overview-and-insights/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">significant legacy infrastructure</a>, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">through the end of 2028</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the first half of 2025, the company spent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\">$30 billion more</a> than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent <a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/news/inside-metas-cloud-deal-with-google-for-ai-infrastructure\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$10 billion deal with Google Cloud</a>, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/55248311/meta-sees-10b-ai-data-center-in-louisiana-using-combo-of-clean-energy-nuclear-power\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dubbed Hyperion</a>, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power</a>. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR5SDS-dmGr0PSpTHkF5PV2cXs3-rKqNuPaMbeyJmaGGE56-qWvJrA29i9S4pg_aem_leaKorFEsIQuzImIDd960A\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">experts say violate the Clean Air Act</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size\" id=\"h-the-stargate-moonshot\">The Stargate moonshot</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just two days after his second inauguration last January, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” OpenAI’s Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/softbank-concedes-stargate-project-with-openai-needs-more-time\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">In August</a>, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of <a href=\"https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/stargate-abilene/abilenes-data-center-advances-swiftly-with-5000-workers/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">eight data centers in Abilene, Texas</a>, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-capex-crunch\">The capex crunch</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Capital expenditures” are usually a pretty dry metric, referring to a company’s spending on physical assets. But as tech companies lined up to report their capex plans for 2026, the rush of data center spending <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\">made the figures a lot more interesting</a> — and a lot bigger.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon was the capex leader, projecting $200 billion in 2026 spending (up from $131 billion in 2025), while Google was a close second with an estimate between $175 billion and $185 billion (up from $91 billion in 2025). Meta estimated $115 billion to $135 billion (up from $71 billion the previous year), although that figure is a little deceptive because a lot of the data center projects have been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jobs-report-unemployment-stock-market-02-11-2026/card/meta-auditor-ey-raised-red-flag-on-data-center-accounting-TrOVlxGZGnL37d8Dv01h?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfLXi35LrT-GxBcA2HfmYDh8FG583K_0E6c2WgM_SIDUcsKWHr4kNRX1d6jgvY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69a20a98&amp;gaa_sig=5xmE3fdoZvA2Mg1RclWhfPyZ8-sO-CcIMq4H5IxjABAspxoyn9VKlAjU2ngMwO5DQdwlGnGuVoCBE0SIXkX1pg%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\">kept off their books entirely</a>. All told, hyperscalers are planning to spend <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly $700 billion on data center projects in 2026 alone</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was enough money to spook some investors. The companies were mostly undeterred, however, explaining that AI infrastructure was vital to their companies’ future. It’s set up a strange dynamic. As you might expect, tech executives are more bullish on AI than their Wall Street counterparts — and the more tech companies spend, the more nervous their bankers get. Add in the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/31/ai-data-centers-debt-sam-altman-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">huge amounts of debt</a> many companies are taking on to fund those buildouts, and you start to hear CFOs across the valley grinding their teeth.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That hasn’t put a damper on AI spending yet, but it will soon — unless of course, hyperscalers show they can make those investments pay off.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was first published on September 22.</em></p>\n</div>",

The Pentagon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/anthropic-and-the-pentagon-are-reportedly-arguing-over-claude-usage/\">pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models be used “all lawful purposes,”</a> while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war\" rel=\"nofollow\">a lengthy statement released Thursday</a>, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/employees-at-google-and-openai-support-anthropics-pentagon-stand-in-open-letter/\">signed an open letter this week</a> asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/\">a social media post</a> that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase out period.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2027578580159631610\" rel=\"nofollow\">a separate post</a>, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anthropic said</a> it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

As part of the partnership, it is using Leica lenses and creating filters in the style of the German camera company. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone has a 50-megapixel main sensor with an F/1.67 aperture and a 1-inch sensor. But the main attraction is the 200-megapixel telephoto camera that has a variable focal length of 75mm-100mm equivalent. That means you can zoom optically between 3.2x and 4.3x. The phone also has a 50 MP ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3098179\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png 1265w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=720,404 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=900,505 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=800,449 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=1099,617 1099w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=708,397 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Xiaomi</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Xiaomi</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also notable: The phone packs a 6,000 mAh battery (the Chinese version comes with a bigger 6,800mAh battery).

Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2026/01/09/top-10-humanoid-robot-companies-by-shipments-revealed/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">according to a Forbes</a> report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.) </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20260219/f2e7e299286e4956862a500317b20acd/c.html#:~:text=Four%20prominent%20rising%20humanoid%20robot,appeared%20in%20regional%20arts%20events.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.</a> </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-robotics-firm-unitree-eyeing-7-billion-ipo-valuation-sources-say-2025-09-08/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$7 billion in a future IPO</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galbot-secures-over-300-million-190800748.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Galbot</a> has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/12/16/humanoid-robots-for-war-and-work-startup-plans-to-build-50000-by-end-of-2027/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. startup Foundation</a>, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251209-12825.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TrendForce report</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bottlenecks-nbsp-to-china-s-dominance\">Bottlenecks to China’s dominance</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Safety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-other-apac-players-nbsp\">Other APAC players </h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is <a href=\"https://japan-forward.com/japan-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">targeting humanoid mass production by 2027</a>. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001105\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028</a>, with plans to produce up to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/hyundai-unveils-new-humanoid-robot-to-work-in-its-car-factories?srnd=undefined\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">30,000 units annually in the U.S.</a> as part of its AI-driven robotics push.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&amp;D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.” </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company <a href=\"https://x.com/supabase/status/2026374754438087119\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledging the issue</a> in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/indian-government-censorsht/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">access to developer platform GitHub</a>, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/github-content-domain-blocked-for-these-indian-users-reports/articleshow/96687992.cms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/vibe-coding-helps-supabase-nab-200m-at-2b-valuation-just-seven-months-after-its-last-raise/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gained traction</a> amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/supabase-nabs-5b-valuation-four-months-after-hitting-2b/\">valuation to $5 billion</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond.</p>\n</div>",

However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/an-accountant-won-a-big-jackpot-on-kalshi-by-betting-against-doge/\">an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi </a>by betting against DOGE believers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms.
