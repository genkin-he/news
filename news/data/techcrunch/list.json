            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Navan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was the first to use a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/shutdown-silver-lining-your-ipo-review-comes-after-investors-buy-in/\">new SEC rule</a> that allows public listings during a government shutdown.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the updated mechanism carries a risk: the government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stock’s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market’s reaction to Navan’s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they’re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan’s expense management solution helps companies manage employees expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639723/000162828025044812/navan-sx1a.htm#ifa73afad53404c2198f451f1c96a9518_669\" rel=\"nofollow\">its S1</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Navan’s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).</p>\n</div>",

The company also introduced new product forms, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to create with its coding tool for sheets to make widgets for getting repeatable insights.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its elements, that would generate designs with editable layers and objects as compared to a flat image. It said the model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’ve found is that where people want to be is the ability to really marry this idea of starting with a prompt and getting far, but also being able to iterate directly themselves.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-infusing-more-ai-features-into-canva\">Infusing more AI features into Canva</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canva-is-adding-an-ai-assistant-coding-and-sheets-to-its-platform/\">a chat-like interface for generating new media</a> items using prompts earlier this year.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.bevel.health/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bevel</a>, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old healthtech company. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. The company also adds that the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days, rare numbers in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with numerous health companion brands, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/whoop-opens-its-blood-testing-service-to-350000-on-wait-list/\">Whoop</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/smart-ring-maker-oura-raises-900m-from-fidelity/\">Oura</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/19/eight-sleep-grabs-100m-to-bring-ai-into-your-bed/\">Eight Sleep</a>, why does the world need another one?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to co-founder and CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaagarwal3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aditya Agarwal</a>, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area such as steps, sleep, or nutrition, Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which helps analyze key information and adapt recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3063834\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1200,600 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1280,640 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=900,450 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=1234,617 1234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bevel</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bevel’s story started with pain—literally.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises. The demanding nature of startup life meant Nguyen took little care of his health, developing chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burnt out. What helped was logging his data manually, through spreadsheets and connected trackers, to rebuild his energy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he connected with Ben and Grey about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With fresh capital and no plans to venture into wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand horizontally into more services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app. We’re excited to support this team as they build the future of personal health.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">In a push to expand its AI footprint in emerging markets, Google has partnered with billionaire Mukesh Ambani–led Reliance Industries to bundle its AI Pro subscription with Jio 5G plans at no extra cost.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/partnering-with-reliance-to-bring-the-best-of-google-ai-to-more-people-across-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a partnership with Reliance, India’s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/perplexity-sees-india-as-a-shortcut-in-its-race-against-openai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">teamed up with Reliance’s arch-rival Bharti Airtel</a>, India’s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel’s 360 million subscribers.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, the world’s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier — a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,” the Indian telecom giant said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 18-month offer is valued at ₹35,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google’s AI Pro plan normally <a href=\"https://one.google.com/ai\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">costs ₹1,950</a> (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in India. Reliance’s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations, and will develop its own pre-built AI agents for the platform.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan</a> to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">setting up shop in India</a>, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world’s biggest emerging market.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/technology/students-in-india-just-got-a-gemini-upgrade/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">offered</a> Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/india-leads-the-way-on-googles-nano-banana-with-a-local-creative-twist/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Nano Banana</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/chatgpt-adoption-skyrockets-in-india-but-monetization-may-be-trailing/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic’s Claude</a>. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Through our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered – where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate and grow,” Ambani said.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">People are increasingly asking AI, not Google, to help them discover products. A recent <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/goodbye-seo-hello-geo-brandlight-openai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shopping </a>report says Americans, this holiday season, will likely turn to large language models this season to find gifts, deals, and sales instead of traditional search.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Retailers could see up to a 520% increase in traffic from chatbots and AI prompts in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the report. For brands, that means figuring out how to show up in AI-generated recommendations, and fast.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This surge in AI-driven traffic is the bet behind <a href=\"https://promptingcompany.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Prompting Company</a>, a YC-backed startup helping products get mentioned in AI apps through GEO (generative engine optimization), a strategy designed for a future where AI agents browse the internet on users’ behalf.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The four-month-old startup, founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinnicholaschandra/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kevin Chandra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-marcelline/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michelle Marcelline</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertputrapurnama/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Albert Punama</a>, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding and already counts Rippling, Rho, Motion, Vapi, Fondo, Kernel, and Traceloop as customers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over the past year, most of the growth on websites has come from AI bots, not people,” co-founder and CEO Chandra told TechCrunch in an interview. “We’re already seeing developers ask AI tools for product recommendations inside their workflows, and we think people, over time, will be less involved in parts of the purchasing funnel.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI becomes the first touchpoint for product discovery and agents eventually transact on a user’s behalf, The Prompting Company believes brands must learn how to market<strong> </strong>to agents as well as humans.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What that means, according to Chandra, is that brands will need an AI-facing website, a version of their site made for agents without navigation bars, pop-ups, or marketing fluff. “Most businesses still design websites only for humans,” Chandra told TechCrunch. “But the fastest-growing segment of users on the internet today is AI agents and they need a completely different interface.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">TechCrunch Disrupt is live!</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">Join Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

It then creates structured content that answers those questions and automatically routes AI agents to “AI-optimized pages.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Y Combinator-backed startup helps companies publish thousands of AI-friendly pages so LLMs can cite their answers even when they don’t rank in traditional SEO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While SEO still matters, Chandra argues that GEO is quickly becoming the priority for brands. In GEO, product results surface organically based on relevance to the conversation, not paid keywords or search rankings.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift may also change how people buy products. Emerging protocols, including Google’s Agent-to-Agent framework and OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe, could further accelerate adoption by allowing AI agents to browse and complete purchases on behalf of users, moving them from discovery to transaction.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Imagine you’re a large e-commerce store. Users can buy items, make returns, compare products, or search for promotions. We help our customers expose those actions to AI agents. Right now, these agents aren’t yet clicking those options or accessing APIs directly, but we expect that to change in the coming months,” said Chandra. “Once that becomes widespread and attribution improves, we see a path toward more advertising- or conversion-driven models. For now, we’re focused on helping companies get discovered and recommended by AI.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, The Prompting Company serves mostly fintech, developer tools, and enterprise SaaS customers. The team says a Fortune 10 company is also using its product, for which it currently hosts about half a million pages. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, traffic driven to client sites is in the double-digit millions per month. The Prompting Company uses a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of prompts tracked and pages hosted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s founders, Indonesian immigrants who met as freshmen, previously built YC-backed <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/typedream\" rel=\"nofollow\">Typedream</a> (YC W20), a startup that allowed users to build and launch websites in minutes with AI, before Lovable and newer entrants took off (beehiiv acquired Typedream last June). </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders also built Cotter, a passwordless authentication SDK that was acquired by Stytch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With The Prompting Company, they’re trying to change how people discover and purchase products in the AI era.  The seed money, raised from Peak XV Partners, Base10, Y Combinator, Firedrop, and angels, including Logan Kilpatrick, will help the company scale its platform and partnerships as AI-powered discovery becomes the new distribution channel. The startup is also collaborating with NVIDIA on next-generation AI search.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If your product isn’t discovered or cited in ChatGPT, you’re <em>ngmi</em>,” said Arnav Sahu, partner at Peak XV Partners. “We’re thrilled to back The Prompting Company as they build the core infrastructure for product discovery—already powering Fortune 10 companies and fast-growing startups. Kevin, Michelle, and Albert are repeat YC founders, and they are awesome.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">IntrCity SmartBus, a tech-enabled intercity bus platform in India, has raised $30 million in funding to expand its network across smaller cities and towns in the South Asian nation. The all-equity Series D round, led by A91 Partners, values the Noida-based startup at $140 million post-money.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intercity travel is accelerating in India as more people migrate from smaller towns to metropolitan cities for work and education.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To meet this demand, New Delhi has significantly expanded the country’s highway infrastructure. The national highway network has <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=154624&amp;ModuleId=3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">increased by over 60%</a> in the past decade, from 56,723 miles to 90,847 miles, according to Indian government data. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Railways, while extensive, remain capacity-constrained and cannot keep pace with rising inter-state travel demand. That makes long-distance road travel a crucial alternative. Yet, state-run intercity bus services are limited and often fall short on reliability and comfort — a gap <a href=\"https://www.intrcity.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IntrCity SmartBus</a> aims to fill.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional operators, IntrCity SmartBus runs on an asset-light model by partnering with local bus owners and equipping their vehicles with proprietary hardware for real-time tracking, co-founder and president Kapil Raizada said in an interview.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also centralizes ticket booking and route planning through its digital platform, which helps determine service frequency, pickup points, boarding stations, and even seat configurations based on demand.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To ensure safety and consistency, IntrCity places trained personnel — called “captains” — on board each bus, Raizada told TechCrunch.

That entry point gave the team early insights into intercity travel behavior and unmet demand in road-based mobility, Raizada said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, RailYatri contributes just around 10% of the startup’s total revenue, while the SmartBus business accounts for the remaining 90%, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IntrCity SmartBus operates around 600 daily bus trips, transporting between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers each day — nearly 700,000 per month. The platform works with more than 50 local bus operators and runs trips averaging over 311 miles each. About 95% of its services are overnight, catering primarily to non-discretionary travel needs such as work, education, or essential appointments. <br/></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s typical passengers are between 20 and 45 years old, including small business owners, trainers, government officials, sales professionals, and students.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup follows a hub-and-spoke model and has identified 15 to 16 key economic hubs across India. It operates in 13 to 14 of these hubs, spanning 15 states. The network covers all of northern India — from Jammu to Uttarakhand — and much of the south, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A lot of data crunching goes into understanding what the consumer needs,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and CEO of IntrCity SmartBus. “This includes decisions like what kind of layout a bus should have — should it be a full sleeper, or a hybrid with both sleepers and seats?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IntrCity SmartBus grew its revenue by 67% year-over-year to ₹5 billion (approximately $57 million) in the last fiscal year. The startup projects revenue to surpass ₹7 billion (around $79 million) in the current year. It has been “EBITDA-positive” for the past couple of years and aims to become fully profitable this year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest funding, the startup plans to go “deeper and wider” through the country and enhance customer experience and safety, as well as upgrade its fleet management technology.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the bigger challenges in in bus mobility across the country that people have concerns about busses. It is seen as a lesser cousin to trains and flights,” Raizada told TechCrunch. “We want to make busses the preferred mode of travel in India.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 223 million intercity journeys were made in India in the financial year 2025, according to a <a href=\"https://travel.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/research-and-statistics/research/redbus-reports-record-223-million-intercity-journeys-in-fy25-revealing-travel-trends-and-innovations/121947964\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recent report</a> by online bus ticketing platform RedBus. The sector added over 72,000 new intercity routes last year, along with approximately 6,400 new buses — expanding capacity by an estimated 265,000 daily seats.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside IntrCity SmartBus, India is seeing a wave of new-age intercity bus startups such as ZingBus, LeafyBus, and FreshBus. European giant FlixBus also <a href=\"https://corporate.flix.com/press_releases/flix-launches-bus-services-in-india-continuing-its-growth-path/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">entered the Indian market</a> early last year, signaling growing traction in the space. Still, IntrCity views competition as secondary to execution.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India is a very different beast when it comes to road travel. If something is going to go wrong, it will go wrong,” Rathi said. “We’re not a network-first company. We’re an operational-excellence-first company.”</p>\n</div>",
