            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Salesforce pulled out all the stops to convince investors that the AI revolution won’t be its death when it <a href=\"http://t\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced </a>fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce reported a solid quarter of $10.7 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\">data management company Informatica</a> last May.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Net income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with <a href=\"https://x.com/anshublog/status/2018762793978413111\" rel=\"nofollow\">Salesforce as their poster child,</a> have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat <a href=\"https://x.com/mcuban/status/2026690613014298881\" rel=\"nofollow\">business models obsolete</a>. The situation has been dubbed the “Saaspocalypse.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&amp;A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja, the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: they all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: Agentic Work Units (“AWU”). The idea here is that rather than simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task, like writing to a record, rather than just generating text. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really <a href=\"https://www.saastr.com/the-real-data-on-ai-agents-what-1-trillion-tokens-a-day-reveals-with-openrouters-coo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">is not</a> in the AI world.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce President and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable task.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself <a href=\"https://x.com/Benioff/status/2026803953342755116/photo/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">owning most of the tech stack</a>, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier,</a> platform. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019413714341097945\" rel=\"nofollow\">on the bottom as the unseen engines</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">As AI-powered search tools reshape how businesses are discovered online, India-founded startup <a href=\"https://www.gushwork.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gushwork</a> is helping companies capture customers from platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity — with early traction that is beginning to draw investor support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old startup said Thursday it had raised $9 million in a seed round led by Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and Lightspeed, with participation from B Capital, Seaborne Capital, Beenext, Sparrow Capital, and 2.2 Capital. The round values Gushwork at $33 million post-money, up from about $7.5 million following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/gushwork-ai-funding-lightspeed/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lightspeed-led $2.1 million pre-seed</a> in July 2023, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The latest financing brings Gushwork’s total funding to $11 million, the startup said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as AI companies including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/perplexity-received-780-million-queries-last-month-ceo-says/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Perplexity</a> begin to chip away at traditional web search, prompting incumbents like Google to roll out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI-generated overviews</a> and other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/google-now-lets-users-jump-from-ai-overviews-into-ai-mode-conversations/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conversational features</a> across their search products. Gushwork is betting this shift will create a new opportunity to help businesses surface in AI-driven discovery channels using its automated marketing agents.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2023 by Nayrhit Bhattacharya (pictured above, right) and Adithya Venkatesh (pictured above, left), Gushwork initially focused on helping small and medium businesses outsource workflows using a mix of AI and human expertise. The startup began narrowing its focus toward search-led marketing after seeing strong customer demand for help with improving online visibility.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started, we were focused on helping businesses outsource faster and outsource better,” Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview, adding that the pull around search from customers became increasingly hard to ignore.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s platform uses a network of AI agents to automatically generate and update search-optimized content, build backlinks — typically 10 to 20 per customer — through a network of roughly 200 to 300 partner websites, and track inbound leads through an integrated content management system. The goal, Bhattacharya said, is to help businesses surface in both traditional search results and AI-generated answers without relying on large in-house marketing teams.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says it has signed up more than 300 paying customers — roughly 95% of them in the U.S. — with subscriptions starting at $800 per month. Gushwork is currently running at about $1.5 million in annualized recurring revenue after rolling out its AI search-focused product around three months ago and is targeting $3 million to $3.5 million ARR in the next three months, Bhattacharya said, adding that the startup is growing about 50% to 80% month over month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

In one case, a professional services client has closed between $200,000 and $350,000 worth of contracts after adopting the platform, he said, declining to disclose the customer’s name. He added that many users are seeing meaningful pipeline growth as AI-driven discovery gains traction.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s customer base today is concentrated among high-ticket B2B service providers, industrial distributors, and contract manufacturers, primarily in the U.S., Bhattacharya said. The startup’s average subscription runs about $800 to $900 per month, or roughly $9,000 to $10,000 in annual contract value, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward AI-driven discovery is still in its early stages but is gaining momentum. Tools such as generative AI chatbots and AI web browsers are increasingly being used by buyers to research vendors and products. OpenAI said in July 2025 that ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">received about 2.5 billion prompts a day</a> globally, including roughly 330 million from U.S. users. Bhattacharya said the trend is beginning to reshape how some businesses approach online visibility.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork plans to use the new funding to expand its engineering team, improve model accuracy and scale its go-to-market efforts, Bhattacharya said. He added that the startup has more than 800 businesses on its waitlist that it plans to begin onboarding.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, headquartered in Delaware with an office in Bengaluru, has about 70 employees in India, along with several contractors.</p>\n</div>",

Sad. A fantastic team is joining Anthropic. I wish them the very best!”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etzioni is also a professor at the University of Washington and known for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oren-etzioni-is-one-successful-founder-2013-9#:~:text=Oren%20Etzioni%20Could%20Be%20The,You've%20Never%20Heard%20Of&amp;text=Decide.com%20announced%20on%20Friday,now%20go%20work%20for%20eBay.\" rel=\"nofollow\">other startups</a> he’s founded and backed as a VC. He did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Etzioni’s LinkedIn post, he accused Bannon, the Vercept lead investor, of being “partly responsible” for Vercept not hiring the correct business people.  A back and forth ensued between the investors, with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432495494322597888/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bannon condemning</a> Etzioni’s remarks: “… you disparaged the heroic work of the founders for achieving an outcome most could only dream of,” Bannon replied in the LinkedIn string. They also accused each other of other less savory things like lying and legal threats.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While public spats between investors are entertaining, and essentially meaningless, the underlying motivation is notable. The stakes are high to build the next-big AI winner and now a promising startup that raised a decently sized warchest will be tucked into Anthropic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Etzioni says he got a return on his money. Anthropic clearly wanted these researchers (perhaps — especially — with another of them at Meta).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Etzioni told GeekWire that he remains bummed. “I’m pleased to have gotten a positive return but obviously disappointed that after just a little over a year with so much traction, and such a fantastic team, we’re basically throwing in the towel,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders joining Anthropic, however, appear happy, according to CEO’s Ehsani’s LinkedIn post. “The choices were clear: we could build independently and work toward the same vision as two separate versions of it, or join forces with an incredible team and accelerate that vision into reality. The decision became an easy choice,” she said of joining Anthropic.</p>\n</div>",

The company reported $215 billion in revenue for the full year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in previous quarters, the company did not report any revenue from chip exports to China, despite the recent lifting of export restrictions by the U.S. government. “While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the US government, they have yet to generate any revenue, and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,” Colette Kress, the company’s chief financial officer, said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress,” she continued, in an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moore Threads’ IPO in December</a>, “and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the investor call, Huang also addressed the company’s pending investment in OpenAI, which has been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/nvidia-is-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-openai-source-says.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported at $30 billion</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Without tokens, there’s no way to grow revenues,” Huang said. “We’ve reached the inflection point and we’re generating profitable tokens that are productive for customers and profitable for the cloud service providers”</p>\n</div>",

They have already made public commitments in recent weeks to cover electricity costs by building their own power sources, paying higher rates, or both, part of a broader effort to solve PR problems around data center expansion and win over skeptical communities. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On January 11, Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> its policy “to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our datacenters is not passed on to residential customers.” January 26, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/stargate-community/\" rel=\"nofollow\">committed</a> to “paying its own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your energy prices.” On February 11, Anthropic made the <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases\" rel=\"nofollow\">same pledge</a> to “cover electricity price increases that consumers face from our data centers.”  Yesterday, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/googles-new-1-9gw-clean-energy-deal-includes-massive-100-hour-battery/\">announced</a> the largest battery project in the world yesterday to support a data center in Minnesota.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What these commitments means in practice, and who will determine which data centers are responsible for which price increases, remains unknown. The White House did not respond to questions about the policy from TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A handshake agreement with Big Tech over data center costs isn’t good enough,” Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly <a href=\"https://x.com/CaptMarkKelly/status/2026493677187538983\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> on social media. “Americans need a guarantee that energy prices won’t soar and communities have a say.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Snapchat <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/first-ever-snappys-awards\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> on Wednesday that it’s hosting its first-ever awards show on March 21. The social media giant says the awards show, called “The Snappys,” is designed to celebrate “the creators shaping culture on Snapchat.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators will receive awards like “Spotlight MVP,” “Best Storyteller,” and “Breakout Creator of the Year,” alongside awards across fashion, beauty, sports, music, food, and games. Additional categories include collaboration, comedy, and cultural impact.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Together, these honors reflect the many ways creators spark conversations, build community, and define culture on Snapchat,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/first-ever-snappys-awards\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “The Snappys reinforces Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to celebrating creators not just as users, but as artists, entertainers, and cultural leaders.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat is the latest social media platform to launch awards for creators. Meta-owned Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/instagram-introduces-new-ring-award-for-top-creators/\">introduced a new “Ring” award</a> last October to recognize creators around the world. Instagram announced the 25 winners online, and each winner received a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, TikTok launched its first-ever <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/tiktok-announces-its-first-awards-show-in-the-us/\">TikTok Awards show</a> in the U.S. Like Snapchat, Instagram handed out category-specific awards, like “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more. It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__logo\">\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 41 20\" width=\"41\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 0v6.452h7.097V20h7.097V6.452h6.451V0zM27.742 13.548V6.452h-7.097V20h20v-6.452zM40.645 0H27.742v6.452h12.903z\" fill=\"#fff\"></path></svg> </div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</div>\n<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container\">\n<div class=\"inline-cta__header-container-desktop\">\n<h3 class=\"inline-cta__header has-h-5-font-size\">Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit</h3>\n<h4 class=\"inline-cta__subheader\">1,000+<strong> founders</strong> and investors come together at <strong>TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026</strong> for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Even if DOGE nixed some federal contracts and laid off workers (which it did), plenty of remaining obligations and the skyrocketing federal debt would remain.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, he wagered his entire life savings — over $342,000 — to take the counter bet that the U.S. federal budget wouldn’t insta-shrink.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">A veteran cybersecurity executive who prosecutors said “betrayed” the United States will spend at least the next seven years behind bars, after pleading guilty to stealing and selling hacking and surveillance tools to a Russian firm.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peter Williams, a former executive at U.S. defense contractor L3Harris, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/former-l3harris-trenchant-boss-jailed-for-selling-hacking-tools-to-russian-broker/\">was sentenced on Tuesday to 87 months in prison</a> for leaking his former company’s trade secrets in exchange for $1.3 million in crypto between 2022 and 2025. Williams sold the exploits to Operation Zero, which the U.S. government calls “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers.” </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The successful conviction of Williams follows one of the most high-profile leaks of sensitive Western-made hacking tools in recent years. Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors say <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/how-an-ex-l3-harris-trenchant-boss-stole-and-sold-cyber-exploits-to-russia/\">Williams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networks</a> to download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a> exploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/\">can be worth millions of dollars</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">U.S. Department of Justice alleged</a> that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">he had been arrested</a>. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. We had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\"> </p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or <a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">by email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a> </div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties with the intelligence community. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China? </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-russian-connection\">The Russian connection</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">I first revealed in October</a>, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We <em>still</em> weren’t there.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">the story was out</a>. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096876\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg 4435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"680\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">the L3Harris building in Burlington, Canada.

Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents, but said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out loud <a href=\"https://x.com/opzero_en/status/1706762507631677760\" rel=\"nofollow\">a post published on X</a> by Operation Zero, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/peter-williams-trenchant-trade-secrets-theft-russian-firm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter</a>, who attended the hearing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\">offers millions of dollars</a> for details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging apps <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/russian-zero-day-seller-is-offering-up-to-4-million-for-telegram-exploits/\">like Telegram</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/prices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">other kinds of software</a>, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/#:~:text=Baseband-,OUR%20CLIENTS,-Our%20clients%20are\" rel=\"nofollow\">claims</a> to work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/treasury-sanctions-russian-zero-day-broker-accused-of-buying-exploits-stolen-from-u-s-defense-contractor/\">announced it had imposed sanctions</a> against Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know what tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-hacked-the-scapegoat-and-why\">Who hacked the scapegoat, and why?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At sentencing, Justice Department prosecutors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">confirmed</a> that the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.” </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-sentenced-87-months-selling-stolen-trade\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">sends</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">these</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/\">notifications</a> to users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Who tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had already begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950140-usa-v-williams-24-doj-sentencing-memo/?q=october&amp;mode=document#document/p5\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to a court document</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",
