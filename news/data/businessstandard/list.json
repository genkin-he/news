Analysts had predicted just 6 per cent on average.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“We expect iPhone revenue to grow double-digits year over year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe outlook signals that Apple is navigating its way through a range of global challenges, including trade tensions, weakness in China and delays developing artificial intelligence features.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWith the company’s latest iPhone release in September, Apple updated the designs and introduced a new ultrathin model called the Air. The lineup remains the company’s biggest moneymaker, accounting for roughly half of its revenue. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/industry/news/apple-india-all-time-revenue-record-september-quarter-2025-125103100266_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple India hits record revenue in September quarter on strong iPhone sales</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tApple shares gained more than 4 per cent in late trading. They had been up 8.4 per cent this year through the close.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 27, sales rose 7.9 per cent to $102.5 billion. That slightly beat the $102.2 billion average estimate. Earnings rose to $1.85 a share, topping the average estimate of $1.77.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Cupertino, California-based company benefited from stronger-than-expected services growth in the period, helping offset a slowdown in China. The Mac and wearables division also performed better than anticipated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTariffs added $1.1 billion in expenses during the quarter, in line with Apple’s expectations. The company expects $1.4 billion in tariff costs in the December period. Operating expenses will range from $18.1 billion to $18.5 billion. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRevenue from greater China fell 3.6 per cent to $14.5 billion last quarter, well short of the $16.4 billion that analysts projected. The company faces mounting competition from local smartphone providers and has struggled to offer artificial intelligence features in the country. Still, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said he believes Apple will return to growth in the region during the current quarter. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRevenue from the iPhone gained 6.1 per cent to $49 billion in the September period, helped by the new models. Still, that was just short of the $49.3 billion that analysts projected. Apple said it faced supply constraints, which may have limited growth. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe quarter included roughly two weeks of iPhone 17 availability, and initial demand appeared strong — with sellouts reported across Apple retail stores and third-party channels. Most buyers opted for higher-end iPhone 17 Pro models, helping boost Apple’s average selling price. The $999 iPhone Air — more expensive than the model it replaced — also helped on this front.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tServices remained Apple’s fastest-growing segment last quarter, with revenue rising 15 per cent to $28.8 billion. Analysts had anticipated $28.2 billion.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tDespite the healthy growth, the services business continues to face challenges from regulators seeking to change App Store policies, which could affect software and subscription revenue. However, Apple secured a recent legal victory when a judge declined to dismantle its $20 billion-a-year search deal with Alphabet Inc.’s Google.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tMac revenue increased 13 per cent to $8.73 billion, topping the $8.6 billion average projection. The company refreshed its MacBook Air and Mac Studio lines in March and released a new entry-level MacBook Pro earlier this month.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tThe iPad business, meanwhile, introduced new low-end and Air models in March and updated a Pro version this month. It generated $6.95 billion in revenue, flat from a year earlier. </div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tSales at the wearables, home and accessories division, which includes AirPods, smartwatches, TV set-top boxes and the HomePod smart speaker, declined less than 1 per cent to $9.01 billion. Analysts had feared a steeper drop in the period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tOnce viewed as a key growth driver, the wearables division peaked in 2021 with nearly $15 billion in holiday-quarter revenue. Newer products like the Vision Pro headset, recently updated with a faster chip, have struggled to gain traction.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tStill, Apple could see renewed interest in the coming years with the introduction of smart glasses and a wave of new smart home devices.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The Trump administration said it's necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the programme into a tool of political retribution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSet to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organisations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or chemical castration of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organisations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChemical castration is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt amounts to a major reworking of a programme that has cancelled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe programme \"was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service not to subsidise organisations that violate the law, whether by harbouring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex, Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new rules are weaponising loan forgiveness to make it harder for groups that work on issues like refugee and transgender rights, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Centre for Immigrant Rights.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLukens said many of the attorneys, social workers and paralegals who work at his organisation on deportation defence and other immigration litigation count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAll of a sudden, that's going away, Lukens said. The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn't, we're going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe programme promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits' tax status and their field of work.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe benefit has gone to workers at organisations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has misdirected tax dollars into activist organisations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organisation's work should be considered to have a substantial illegal purpose.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEmployers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the programme if a state or federal court rules against them, or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. Performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, appears to be grounds for expulsion.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEven without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organisation should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the preponderance of the evidence leans against the employer.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe department dismissed concerns from many who said that bar is too low.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers, federal officials wrote.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, simply because those attorneys' jobs were deemed politically unfavourable by the Secretary.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules based on their own priorities or ideology.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRep Tim Walberg, chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at radical organisations that violate state and federal laws.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. Those barred from the programme can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a corrective action plan approved by the secretary.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDocuments from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances. Not all organisations that break the law have a substantial illegal purpose, the agency said, and it ultimately comes down to the secretary's analysis of the evidence.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Adjusted for consumer health and in-licensed products, the brokerage believes the domestic business growth was 6 per cent Y-o-Y. \"The company needs to improve the domestic growth going forward. Its US business fell 2 per cent Y-o-Y and missed our expectation by 2 per cent due to gRevlimid price erosion,\" the brokerage said in its note. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the performance in Africa and emerging markets was ahead of the estimated, which offset the decline in the other businesses.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChoice noted that the India and the US business accounted for 68 per cent of revenue in Q2FY26, underscoring their significance in the company's portfolio mix. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to analysts, Cipla’s India business is expected to maintain strong growth momentum, driven by new product launches in the GLP-1 and chronic therapy segments, along with continued leadership in key respiratory brands like Foracort.

It expects a gradual recovery to 23.5 per cent in FY27, aided by revenue contributions from the GLP-1 franchise.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEchoing similar views, Nuvama noted that upcoming launches of the partnered GLP-1 molecule Tirzepatide and Semaglutide generic offer promising domestic growth avenues, while four respiratory and three peptide product launches are expected in calendar year 2026.

Those activities count as digital trade when the transactions cross national borders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile Trump wields tariffs to rebalance US deficits in merchandise trade, his push for a global internet free of import duties and other surcharges is aimed at ensuring the world’s largest economy remains the leading net exporter of e-services. That stands in contrast with the prior administration under Joe Biden, which was more sympathetic to European officials’ concerns about unfettered access to markets for US tech giants including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The Trump administration believes that our deficit in trade in goods has been unfairly imposed, but that our surplus in trade in services has been fairly earned” and wants to “maintain our services surplus, while reducing our goods deficit,” said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown Law in Washington. “I could understand why other countries would feel that this is itself unfair.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLast year, global exports of digitally delivered services increased to more than $4.77 trillion, a nearly 10 per cent jump from 2023 and more than double the growth in total goods and services trade, according to World Trade Organization and United Nations figures. It’s the fastest-growing segment of global goods and services trade that reached about $33 trillion last year.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSupercharging digital trade is artificial intelligence, raising questions for officials concerned about national security, data sovereignty, intellectual property abuse and consumer privacy protections as online services flow unchecked across borders. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFor some nations, it means a loss of government revenue as items formerly shipped as goods – a book or a movie, for example – are now sent digitally and out of reach of traditional customs duties.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs Trump tries to rewire the global trading system, digital commerce has become another battleground for geopolitical fragmentation where Washington and Beijing are jockeying for influence across Africa, Latin America and South Asia.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe new US provisions for Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand stand out because they call for long-term acceptance of an agreement forged at the WTO calling on all countries to refrain from putting tariffs on digital services.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAll three Southeast Asian economies agreed to support a permanent extension of the WTO accord known as the “moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAside from that initiative and another aimed at protecting fisheries, Washington has abandoned the WTO – the referee of the rules-based trading system for the past 30 years - in favor of Trump’s unilateral approach with so-called reciprocal tariffs.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\t\tGlobal Agreement</h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe WTO moratorium has been extended by consensus every two years since 1998, most recently in 2024 when it only was approved in a last-minute deal held up by objections from India. It comes up for renewal again heading into the Geneva-based organization’s ministerial meeting in March 2026 in Cameroon.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The commitments in the US deals to facilitate the free flow of data are absolutely welcome – especially when set against the trend for localization requirements that we’ve seen in recent years,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “While country-by-country progress is valuable, the ultimate goal should be to anchor these norms in a new international deal.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMalaysia’s accord with Trump included the additional concession that it will refrain from “requiring US social media platforms and cloud service providers to pay into Malaysia’s domestic fund.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe latest digital pacts by the US – plus a preliminary one with Vietnam that contains a vague pledge to finalize digital services commitments — follow a framework the US announced in July with Indonesia, whose customs agency had preemptively added a line for digital services in its harmonized tariff schedule, or HTS. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThat deal specified that “Indonesia has committed to eliminate existing HTS tariff lines on ‘intangible products’ and suspend related requirements on import declarations,” according to the White House document.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tUnder Trump, the US push for a permanent extension will have to address concerns from Brazil and India, both of which have faced some of the steepest US tariffs. In the past, both have wanted to preserve the option of raising revenue from foreign tech companies and protecting domestic e-commerce companies. Keeping the moratorium renewable also gave them leverage in other areas of trade.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“That extension looked very shaky after the last ministerial conference,” said Simon Evenett, a professor of geopolitics and strategy at IMD Business School in St. Gallen, Switzerland.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\t\tUS Big Tech</h3>\n<div>\r\n\t\tStill, he said, while the US uses its leverage to push for a permanent extension of the moratorium, “it’s too soon to say this represents broad-based WTO re-engagement — more likely, it’s selective engagement on a topic critical to US big tech.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDigital services provisions are part of most modern trade agreements, though the US and European Union have different views on the need for openness.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOfficials in Brussels want safeguards against anti-competitive behavior and stricter data privacy protections — oversight that US officials consider over-regulation. Some European countries have annoyed Washington by imposing taxes on digital services, viewing such moves as domestic fiscal policy that’s outside the scope of trade talks. French lawmakers earlier this week voted to double a tax on large technology companies, risking a backlash from Trump.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe US-EU trade framework dated Aug. 21 noted both sides “commit to address unjustified digital trade barriers” and will together pursue a permanent WTO’s e-commerce moratorium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMartina Ferracane, an associate professor of international digital trade at Teesside University in the UK, said another temporary extension is likelier than a permanent one because the US administration has “weakened its credibility” to lead a global consensus on the issue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tShe cited Trump’s pledge to put 100 per cent tariffs on films made outside the US as an example of a “threat of non-compliance” with the international ban on tariffs on digital commerce.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
