It has surpassed 1,000 registrations and achieved over $100 billion in banking assets at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt a panel discussion titled, ‘Has the GIFT-IFSC truly arrived?’ moderated by Khushboo Tiwari of Business Standard, experts said the international financial hub has evolved beyond banking, insurance, and capital markets. There are now over 35 active business segments operating in the centre.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDipesh Shah, executive director, IFSCA, said the time was ripe for GIFT City to be seen alongside global peers, such as Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Singapore.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I would definitely answer positively that GIFT City has arrived. It is now in everyone’s interest to make it comparable to Singapore and other global financial centres — rapidly and decisively,” Shah said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe financial hub is also attracting foreign companies exploring direct listings on its international exchanges.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve been doing roadshows over the past year to engage companies looking to raise between $50 million and $200 million. Even some Silicon Valley firms are in talks with us,” said V Balasubramaniam, managing director (MD) &amp; chief executive officer (CEO), NSE International Exchange.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that such offerings fill a gap for mid-sized listings that often struggle to find space in the US market, where initial public offerings (IPOs) typically exceed $1 billion in size.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNSE International Exchange recently recorded its highest-ever monthly turnover of $103 billion, surpassing the previous peak in May.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBalasubramaniam said that traders increasingly use the GIFT Nifty index as a key barometer for post-market movements and investor sentiment in Indian equities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPraising IFSCA’s market-friendly approach, Revati Kasture, CEO of CareEdge Global IFSC, said the regulatory environment has created new opportunities for financial innovation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We began operations in October 2024 by offering ratings across 39 countries. The idea was to bring an emerging-market perspective to global ratings, which has long been dominated by US-based agencies,” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKasture added that in 17 of those 39 markets, global rating agencies later revised their views in a direction consistent with CareEdge’s ratings — validating the model’s relevance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile favourable tax policies have helped accelerate activity at GIFT City, experts urged the government to extend the existing 10-year tax holiday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There’s a clear case for extension,” said Tushar Sachade, Partner, Price Waterhouse &amp; Co LLP. “Providing 15–20 years of certainty would offer businesses a long-term horizon and greater confidence in setting up operations.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSachade also called for clarity in the next Union Budget on taxation rules for certain categories of funds, particularly outbound schemes. “Unlike inbound structures, outbound public funds lack a defined tax regime and currently rely on the trust taxation framework. We also need clear safe-harbour norms,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExperts highlighted that IFSCA operates with full policy autonomy and globally aligned regulations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If an Indian entity regulated by a domestic agency wants to operate in GIFT City, it needs a no-objection certificate from that regulator. But for foreign firms, the licensing process is direct with IFSCA,” said Shah, citing the example of a Taiwanese bank setting up operations without an India presence.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgreeing with this, Kasture added: “Some products not permitted in the domestic market, such as private credit ratings, are allowed at GIFT. The regulatory philosophy is international, not domestic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBalasubramaniam further said that the introduction of zero-day expiry contracts on GIFT Nifty aligns with global standards and “should not be seen through a domestic-market lens.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also highlighted the proposed Global Access Provider framework, designed to enable investors and institutions in GIFT City to access a wider range of overseas assets and products.</div></div>",

The gain exceeded the 18 per cent growth that analysts had expected and marked the biggest year-over-year rise since OpenAI’s ChatGPT came on the scene in late 2022.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak Podcast on Apple, Spotify and other Podcast Platforms.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe results reinforce the logic that major technology companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have been using to justify record spending levels on data center construction — that demand for AI is outstripping the supply of global computing capacity. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon’s results came a day after investors punished Meta Platforms Inc. for projecting even greater spending in 2026. Unlike Microsoft and Google, Meta isn’t a major cloud-computing provider to outside customers. That means its spending spree could be riskier.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon’s shares jumped 12 per cent to $249.42 as the markets opened in New York on Friday, the biggest intraday jump since April.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe stock’s performance had lagged behind that of its industry peers this year, with investors worrying that the company has yet to demonstrate enough benefit from its artificial intelligence products. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft’s Azure cloud business grew at almost twice the rate of AWS, while Google Cloud posted 33.5 per cent growth.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Clearly AWS continues to drive the bus here, with acceleration in growth and better-than-expected operating margin,” analysts with William Blair said in a research note after earnings. “The acceleration helps ease some of the narrative around the company’s lack of strategic vision or advantage in the emerging AI landscape.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy has pushed the company’s capital spending to a record in the quarter to keep up in an arms race with its biggest rivals. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestor expectations for Amazon’s cloud business were relatively low heading into Thursday’s earnings report after the company in recent quarters cited constraints in getting new data centers online. Jassy and other executives had said they were optimistic about the business, though they stopped short of forecasting a reacceleration of growth.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tJassy opened a conference call with analysts after the results were released by cheering the prospects for AWS and rattling off figures on the impact of AI on the company’s businesses, most of which Amazon hadn’t disclosed previously. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company estimates that Rufus, the shopping chatbot embedded in its retail apps, will help deliver an additional $10 billion in annual sales. Connect, the company’s call center product that is widely seen as its most successful software offering for office workers, is on track to pull in $1 billion in annualized revenue, Jassy said. Bedrock, the AWS marketplace for businesses to tap into AI models, could ultimately be as big a business as EC2, the computing service that is one of the cloud unit’s primary money makers.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have momentum,” he said. “You can see it.” <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring the quarter that ended Sept. 30, Amazon’s total sales rose 13 per cent to $180.2 billion, the company said in the statement. Analysts, on average, were anticipating $177.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder Jassy, Amazon has been working to improve the profitability of the retail business by stepping up automation and selling higher-margin ads and other services to online merchants. That work has receded from the headlines as investors focus on the company’s battle in the market for AI. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tLike its biggest rivals, Amazon has invested heavily in data centers and chips to build and operate AI models capable of generating text or images and automating processes. Capital expenditures rose 61 per cent to $34.2 billion in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe power capacity of the AWS data center fleet has doubled since 2022, and Jassy said he expected it to double again by 2027. Last week, the unit suffered its biggest outage in years. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThough Amazon has sought to position its cloud business as a marketplace for a broad range of AI tools, for now, it has a lot riding on a single partner: Anthropic PBC, the maker of the Claude chatbot and software coding assistant.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon is backing Anthropic with an investment of $8 billion, and built the startup a massive complex of data centers and custom AWS AI chips. That system, called Project Rainier, is up and running, the company said this week. Amazon said its Trainium2 chip was “fully subscribed” and represented a multibillion-dollar business.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tGoogle recently announced a deal to provide Anthropic with some of its own chips. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the third quarter, Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion, which included a $2.5 billion charge related to a legal settlement announced last month with the Federal Trade Commission over Prime subscriptions and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. The company said earlier this week that it would cut about 14,000 corporate workers and warned of further terminations in 2026. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon projected that revenue in the holiday quarter would be $206 billion to $213 billion, meeting analysts’ estimates. Operating profit will be $21 billion to $26 billion, also in line with expectations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the third quarter, sales generated by the online store business increased 10 per cent to $67.4 billion. Advertising unit revenue jumped 24 per cent to $17.7 billion. Third-party seller services from merchants who use Amazon’s e-commerce site increased 12 per cent to $42.5 billion.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to make India’s tax system more trust-based, simpler, and technology-driven in the Union Budget 2026-27, with a focus on faster dispute resolution and easier Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rules. “India’s next leap requires a principle-based, technology-enabled, and trust-anchored tax system,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said after the industry body met the revenue secretary on Thursday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCII noted that tax litigation continues to burden businesses, with more than five lakh appeals involving nearly ₹18 lakh crore pending before the commissioner (appeals). It asked the government to fast-track cases involving more than ₹100 crore and resolve them within one year through virtual hearings and close monitoring by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Penalty proceedings should be paused till the main appeal is settled, and draft orders should be shared for factual checks before being finalised, it suggested. CII also sought revival of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) under retired high court judges, “empowered to deliver binding rulings within six months”.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build taxpayer confidence, CII called for converting the existing taxpayer charter into a legal Taxpayer Rights Charter guaranteeing time-bound refunds, faceless assessments, and accountability for administrative delays. It also flagged issues in the Central Processing Centre (CPC) system for return processing and asked for “improved protocols ensuring that only apparent mistakes are adjusted automatically and that taxpayers can request virtual hearings when required”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn direct tax simplification, CII said the TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework — with more than 35 categories and multiple rates — has become too complex and affects business liquidity. It recommended reducing the framework to two or three broad rates, exempting transactions between Goods and Services Tax (GST)-registered entities, and clarifying that no TDS should apply to the GST portion of a payment. “Tax simplification is not a concession; it is an investment in governance efficiency,” Banerjee said. “When rules are clear and systems are digital, compliance becomes automatic and disputes become exceptional.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn indirect taxes and customs, CII pitched a one-time settlement scheme for old disputes, longer validity for advance rulings, and full digital processing of customs through Application Programming Interface (API)-based systems. It suggested a roadmap for “paper-free customs by 2028” with e-refunds, e-adjudication, and e-appeals. CII also called for rationalising tariffs by consolidating exemption notifications and permitting a single appeal for multiple bills of entry (BoE) where issues are common, along with automatic release of bonds once export obligations are met.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo improve predictability, CII suggested a multi-year corporate tax roadmap and removal of prosecution for minor and unintentional errors under both direct and indirect tax laws. “CII’s proposals are not about cutting taxes, but they are about cutting friction,” Banerjee said, adding that a trust-based compliance system can boost revenues without hurting the exchequer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India has already shown the world that large-scale reforms like GST 2.0 can succeed,” he said. “If we now make our tax systems as simple and predictable as they are digital and fair, we will not only raise revenues more efficiently but also build the foundations of an economy that inspires confidence — both at home and abroad.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

To paraphrase a remark often attributed to Leon Trotsky, centrist economists may not be interested in war, but war is interested in them.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tMy 2016 book The Curse of Cash, which explored the past, present, and future of money, is a case in point. After its publication, I received more than 20 death threats, some clearly from drug dealers and gun owners outraged by my call to phase out $100 bills, and others from crypto evangelists who considered my support for regulation an act of treason.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOddly enough, I didn’t mind the threats as much as one might expect. As unhinged as some of these people were, at least they had understood the book’s arguments; they just vehemently disagreed with them.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe same cannot be said of the 2013 uproar over my work with Carmen M Reinhart. That episode began when three University of Massachusetts Amherst economists argued that our six-page 2010 conference paper “Growth in a Time of Debt” contained multiple “errors” that had supposedly misled policymakers in Europe and the United States into adopting harmful austerity measures in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The ensuing outrage fostered a false narrative that persists to this day.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn reality, our paper contained only a single error. Critically, that error did not appear in the full-length edited journal version, published in 2012, which was based on a much larger and more complete dataset. As Stanford’s Michael J Boskin observed at the time, it is hardly unusual for preliminary research to undergo corrections during the revision process.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tBoth versions of the paper reached the same general conclusion: Across advanced economies, periods of very high public debt tend to coincide with slower economic growth. Of course, this finding does not mean that running deficits harms short-term growth any more than borrowing to buy something you enjoy makes you unhappy. It simply means that the long-term burden of debt can weigh on future prosperity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOur analysis divided countries into two groups: Those with debt levels over 90 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and those below. But the 90 per cent mark was never a “threshold” where growth suddenly collapses; it was merely a divide to illustrate that high-debt countries as a group underperform, on average. As we explained repeatedly, having debt reach 90 per cent of GDP does not imply growth collapse any more than people who drive slightly over the speed limit or whose cholesterol levels are just above the recommended range see a sudden jump in risk.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThere are solid theoretical reasons why high debt can impede growth. Heavy government borrowing can crowd out private investment, while the taxes required to service that debt are often distortionary. And when debt is already high, governments have less fiscal space to respond to crises or invest in infrastructure. Once the controversy subsided and researchers began examining our data, along with newer datasets, the evidence that emerged largely supported our original conclusions.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe most pernicious misrepresentation was that we somehow advocated austerity, when neither the concept nor the word appeared anywhere in our work. In truth, our real offence was suggesting that there might be a tradeoff between debt and growth. While stimulating the economy during a downturn is important, the size of the stimulus needs to be calibrated, especially if it leads to very high debt.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn fact, our 2009 book This Time Is Different (written before we later tackled debt and growth) showed that financial crises almost always necessitate a sharp increase in government debt. We argued that governments facing debt crises have often resorted to heterodox solutions rather than relying solely on conventional monetary and fiscal measures. I also advocated partial debt forgiveness for US subprime borrowers and for highly indebted southern European economies.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn the early stages of the 2008 crisis, I even proposed that central banks temporarily relax their inflation targets as a less painful way to deleverage their economies — an idea that was considered blasphemous at the time but has since gained traction. Do these ideas and proposals amount to promoting austerity, or do they recognise a richer menu of policy options than the crude Keynesianism that has dominated too much of the debate, even to this day?</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tPerhaps this time is different. Having grown accustomed to misrepresentation as the price of taking centrist positions in the age of cancel culture, I have been pleasantly surprised by the reception of my latest book, Our Dollar, Your Problem. Reviewers, interviewers, and commentators from across the ideological spectrum have engaged with it seriously, appreciating its analysis of the strengths and vulnerabilities of our dollar-based global financial system.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tRemarkably, this open-mindedness has extended even to some critics from the austerity camp. That makes me think that perhaps there is hope for more reasonable discussions in the future — though I’m not holding my breath.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<hr/>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t    </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<em><strong>The author is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University  ©Project Syndicate, 2025</strong></em></div></div>",

In a fireside chat with <strong>Tamal Bandyopadhyay</strong>, he talks of various aspects of Sebi’s functioning. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>At your very first board meeting, you spoke about building public trust and sorting out conflict of interest. How do you settle issues and conflicts — not just in the market but also within Sebi? Where are we today on these issues?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIt’s important to understand that Sebi is an institution. It has been nurtured and developed by several of my predecessors, along with industry and market participants, through collaboration. Today, Sebi has a strong reputation not only in India but also overseas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tTrust is critical, both internally and externally. It does not come from a single measure — there is no magic wand. It stems from a series of actions: Our language, how we communicate, our regulatory framework, and a fair and judicious application of regulations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier there was concern over whether we had a robust internal framework on managing conflict of interest. We had set up a high-level committee on this aspect. The committee has been deliberating on the matter and engaging with several internal and external stakeholders. I expect its report to be submitted in a few days, possibly by November 10. We will take the next steps, based on its recommendations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>We have never had any five-year period during which foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sold so much. Is it only about valuation, or is there something else?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the basis of my interaction with FPIs and other participants in foreign markets, I find their confidence in India remains high. They believe in India’s long-term growth story and also see short-term opportunities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFPIs’ market capitalisation in India is about $900 billion. They allocate across global markets and assess where they can get the best returns. So, an outflow of $45 billion in the past year — with some months of positive flows and some negative — must be seen in proportion. The outflow of $45 billion on a base of $900 billion is not very significant.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, FPIs have given feedback on improving access, simplifying processes, and addressing pain points. We are working on those. We have simplified and digitised FPI registration.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India has one of the largest primary markets, but you recently reduced the size of a minimum public offer (MPO) in an IPO and the minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirement for listed companies. Is there a disconnect?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLet me clarify: We have not diluted the norms on MPS. MPS remains at 25 per cent — unchanged. What we examined was the MPO and the time allowed for companies to achieve MPS.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe markets have expanded. After the IPO of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), we began discussing companies with a ₹6 trillion market cap coming to the market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStrict timelines on MPS can act like a Damocles’ sword, potentially hurting minority shareholders due to price volatility. So, we took a realistic view of what the market can absorb. After extensive consultations and excellent feedback, we introduced multiple pathways to achieving compliance on MPS and MPO, without compromising on investor protection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>MFs enjoy a tax advantage over portfolio management services and alternative investment funds. That's one side of the story. On the other hand, while the Reserve Bank of India is paving the way for banks to lend more to earn more interest income, Sebi is limiting the sources of MF income. Yes, I am referring to the new discussion paper on the expense ratio ...</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs are critical for retail participation. We have 56 million unique investors. The industry has grown rapidly but is still 20-25 per cent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP). In advanced economies, MFs’ assets under management are 80-85 per cent of GDP.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs must grow faster because they provide a safer way for retail investors to enter the market and promote long-term investing. Their tax status is aligned with that structure — it is a pass-through model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MF industry has grown significantly and become more professional. We cannot constrain it. That is why we introduced options like specialised investment funds and other reforms, allowing more activities with appropriate risk segregation. Simplifying regulations has been a key objective. Some proposals on the fee structure stem from the need for greater clarity, fairness, and transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi research shows 90-93 per cent of individual investors lose money in F&amp;Os. There has been so much discussion on easing out weekly F&amp;Os. When will we see that?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a sensitive subject and requires thoughtful handling. We adopted a calibrated approach and implemented a series of measures to improve the market after five rounds of consultation. Initially, we received diverse views, which we reconciled.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome measures have taken effect; others will kick in as late as December 1. Some began in October, some in July, and more are scheduled for May 2026. We have introduced guardrails — limiting expiries to only two days a week and one index per day — to curb irrational exuberance among retail investors less aware of the workings of the market. Statutory warnings have also been included on the trading screen.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the same time, many market participants actively use derivatives products. We cannot abruptly shut down the market. Therefore, any further steps will be released for public consultation. Stakeholders can evaluate the data and provide feedback before we proceed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will the IPO of the National Stock Exchange see the light of day during your tenure?</strong></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> Of course, unless you want my tenure to be very short.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you take us through Sebi’s “30-second cyber-security check”?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is an important initiative by Sebi. With support from market participants, banks, and others, we have developed a unique system — the first of its kind globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia is a global leader in Unified Payments Interface and digital public infrastructure. With 45-50 per cent of the world’s digital transactions happening in India, convenience is high, but that also enables fraudsters. Our objective is to end the ease of doing fraud. We must protect millions of investors at scale.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMany people spend time choosing vegetables or comparing products, but not even 30 seconds checking if their securities account is secure. The “30-Second Check” on Sebi’s Saarthi app enables users to quickly verify bank-account linkage, demat-account security, MF statements, the validity of the advisor or intermediary, and whether any unauthorised transfer or pledge has taken place.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a systemic, preventive effort — unique globally. The aim is for current and potential investors to be aware so that they do not lose money. Market risk is understood — but fraud risk must be avoided.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the latest on finfluencers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe are doing around 5,000 takedowns every month, and have taken down over 100,000 pieces of content from platforms with support from Google, Meta, and others. With better tools and platforms deploying artificial intelligence more effectively, we should be able to act even more forcefully.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi has gained more teeth over the years. Do you need additional powers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have adequate powers. We must use them judiciously, sensibly, and consistently. We also need to keep upgrading our surveillance tools — which we are doing. If we have done well, we must do even better. If we keep exercising these powers responsibly, we will continue to maintain public trust in the capital markets — because as a watchdog, that is our duty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You recently launched an e-office in Sebi. Is that correct?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat’s correct. Sebi was, I admit, late in adopting it. This will strengthen efficiency in the organisation. I can say we are fortunate to have some of the finest minds at Sebi.</div></div>",
