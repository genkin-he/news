The Republican president claimed his trade negotiations would secure prosperity and security to millions of Americans.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut back in Washington, senators several from Trump's Republican Party have demonstrated their dissent with Trump's tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump's tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is still much higher than we've had.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt still will lead to increased prices, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new rule that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won't ultimately take effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Democrats can force a vote but not a result</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tBut Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmerican families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up, said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that in many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest, and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that Americans shouldn't be fooled by Trump's announcement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDonald Trump has folded, leaving American families and farmers and small businesses to deal with the wreckage from his blunders, from his erratic on again off again tariff policies, said the New York Democrat.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Republicans see Trump's trade policy</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tOverall, there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump's import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThose four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil, but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI agree with my colleagues that tariffs should be more targeted to avoid harm to Americans, said Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a floor speech. Yet, he added that Trump's negotiations are bearing fruit and praised his announcement that Beijing would allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans again.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans representing farm states were especially enthused by the announcement that China would be purchasing 25 million metric tonnes of soybeans annually, starting with 10 million metric tons for the rest of this year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said the deal with China absolutely justifies Trump's use of tariff threats to negotiate trade policy with other nations. He called the announcement huge news for Kansas farmers, but also acknowledged that they would still probably need financial help as they deal with the strain of losing their biggest customer for soybeans and sorghum.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not like you can snap your finger and send over $15 billion worth of sorghum and soybeans together overnight, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina had been the largest purchaser of US soybeans until this year. It purchased almost 27 million metric tons in 2024, so Trump's negotiated deal only guarantees to return soybean exports to China to less than their previous level.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called the purchase agreement a start.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAsked whether he agreed with Trump's assessment that his meeting with Xi had been a runaway success, Cramer smiled and said the president is nothing if not optimistic.</p><p></p></div>",

It has been the fastest-growing large economy in the world for the past three years, and we expect it to be a global driver of PE demand,” said Hari Gopalakrishnan, partner, head of India and co-head of services at Swedish PE firm EQT, during a panel discussion moderated by Nivedita Mookerji of <em>Business Standard</em>.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tGopal Jain, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer of Gaja Alternative Asset Management, the first PE firm planning a listing in India, said the country now has enough data and a clear trend to show that PE is on its way to becoming a mainstream sector.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“For many years, India has been the fastest-growing alternative market in the world, though that’s partly because we started from a small base. PE still punches below its weight,” said Jain.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tCurrently, he said, banks, insurance, and mutual funds dominate the mainstream financial sector. “We have $2.5 trillion in bank deposits in India. In comparison, PE within the alternative investment fund (AIF) space is just a small fraction. But now, alternatives are well on their way to becoming mainstream,” Jain added.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAbhishek Kabra, MD of Samara Capital, highlighted that over the past 25 years, PE has outperformed public markets globally by 6.7 per cent. “If you look at 10-year rolling returns, it’s a proven form to invest, park capital, and generate returns,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In the past four years, we’ve seen three years where global PE investment reached $2 trillion annually. It is certainly mainstream at the global level. In India too, we are seeing an increase in deal flow, a vibrant ecosystem, and a growing domestic pool of capital available to AIFs and fund managers. Among ultra-HNIs and family offices, about 7-8 per cent of allocations currently go toward AIFs,” Kabra said, adding that share is expected to rise to 15-16 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManish Kejriwal, founder and managing partner of Kedaara Capital, acknowledged that “around 2010, PE firms almost didn’t deliver returns to their LPs,” but said the situation has transformed with stronger exit opportunities through IPOs and sponsor-to-sponsor deals.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The IPO markets are obviously a very important component, and we now have sponsor-to-sponsor sales as well. We are in the process of selling a few companies. We’ve already taken nine companies public, and it’s a very robust exit market. Unless we return capital to our LPs, they won’t reinvest in India. That’s the fundamental change that happened in the past decade. The IPO markets have played a major role in that,” Kejriwal said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGopalakrishnan added that global market uncertainty is shifting investor focus to Asia and India. “If you look at Asia, again, India is one of the fastest-growing countries. And so global investors are looking more to Asia for growth. Within Asia, India is a bright spot. Incrementally, I would expect India to grow ahead of everybody else. But it's also of a small base,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJain highlighted that India is now the world’s fifth-largest economy, while the US, Japan, Europe, and China currently account for 90-95 per cent of global PE activity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Now that India is a large market, and with large markets comes a large economy, a large IPO market, large supply of entrepreneurs, large consumption base, all of that, private equity is set to grow and catch up to where it should be in the economy. In India, private equity punches below its weight because private equity worked only in part for the last 30 years --- the last five or six years. It started to work better, and has started to produce returns,” Jain said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
