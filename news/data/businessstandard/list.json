            "id": 125103100422,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAmerican carmaker Ford has announced plans to invest about ₹3,250 crore to manufacture powertrains at its Chennai plant, focusing on “next-generation” engines. The company is considering using its Maraimalai Nagar facility on the outskirts of the city as an export hub, with an annual capacity of 235,000 units and production scheduled to begin in 2029.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuilding on a letter of intent signed in September 2024, Ford representatives and the Tamil Nadu government on Friday formalised a memorandum of understanding (MoU) setting out a strategy to tap into India’s “manufacturing prowess”. Senior Ford executives met Chief Minister M K Stalin as part of the agreement, which is likely to see the facility play a key role vis-à-vis the company’s Southeast Asian markets.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MoU complements Ford India’s existing infrastructure for producing and exporting engines. “We are pleased to advance our plans and confirm the Chennai plant’s vital role in Ford’s manufacturing network,” said Jeff Marentic, president of Ford’s international markets group. Ford sold its vehicle manufacturing facility in Sanand to Tata Motors in 2022, but continues to operate its engine plant there for export markets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are thankful to the Government of Tamil Nadu for its continued support as we advance these plans,” Marentic added. “This decision reinforces our commitment to leveraging India’s manufacturing prowess for future products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDetails about the specific engines to be produced in Chennai, and their export destinations, will be disclosed closer to the start of production.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTamil Nadu Industries Minister T R B Rajaa welcomed the announcement, calling it “a boost to the resurgent automotive sector of Tamil Nadu”. “It speaks volumes about the state's robust manufacturing ecosystem, highly skilled workforce, and excellent investor facilitation,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe decision marks Ford’s return to manufacturing in Chennai two years after it halted production at the Maraimalai Nagar plant in August 2022. The site’s location, less than 50 km from Chennai port and 74 km from Ennore port, offers strong logistical advantages, with Bengaluru also just 320 km away by road.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the time of its exit, Ford India had reported accumulated losses of around $2 billion over a decade and held less than a 2 per cent share of the country’s passenger vehicle market through models such as the EcoSport and Endeavour SUVs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This is not just the restart of manufacturing at the existing Ford facility,” Rajaa said. “It is the state taking yet another step towards the future of the automotive industry with the production of nextgen engines. We remain committed to supporting Ford's operations here.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe new investment is expected to create more than 600 direct jobs, along with indirect employment across the automotive supply chain. Ford currently employs about 12,000 people at its global business operations unit in Tamil Nadu.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company said it continues to serve more than one million customers in India through service, aftermarket parts, and warranty support. The shutdown of the Maraimalai Nagar factory in 2022 reportedly cost Ford’s India arm about ₹1,296 crore in severance payments, benefiting 2,592 workers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The upgradation trend from soaps to facewash, supported by higher disposable incomes and changing grooming preferences, is expected to sustain strong momentum in the coming years,” the release added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are delighted to welcome the Muuchstac brand to Godrej Consumer Products. The brand’s strong resonance among younger consumers, high profitability, and proven digital execution model make it a powerful addition to our personal care portfolio. This acquisition enhances our participation in the fast-growing men’s grooming segment and supports our vision of building a future-ready, innovation-led GCPL,” said Sudhir Sitapati, managing director and chief executive officer at GCPL, in the release.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonak Bagadia and Vishal Lohia, founders of Muuchstac, said they look forward to the business scaling up in line with their vision of redefining men’s skincare in India and added that they will work closely with the team at Godrej for the same.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the July–September quarter, GCPL’s consolidated net profit fell 6.5 per cent to ₹459.3 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts net sales grew 4.3 per cent to ₹3,825.1 crore.

Despite these headwinds, our India business, excluding soaps, has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth, reflecting the strength of our core portfolio and execution.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said that the recent GST rate reduction is a welcome structural reform that will strengthen long-term consumer demand.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs warned by the company ahead of its earnings, Sitapati said in the release, “However, this transition led to short-term trade disruptions as the channel adjusted to new pricing and cleared old inventory, particularly impacting soaps and hair colour. Despite this, we continue to gain market share in soaps and other key categories.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that in October, the company entered the ₹3,000-crore toilet cleaner category, which is growing at strong double digits.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our new brand, Godrej Spic, has been launched in select South Indian states, priced competitively at ₹79 for 500 ml, marking an important step in expanding our home care portfolio,” he said.</div></div>",
