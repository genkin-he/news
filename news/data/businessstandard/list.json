            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tThe Senate passed a resolution Thursday that would undo many of President Donald Trump's tariffs around the globe, the latest note of displeasure at his trade tactics in Washington that came just as the president celebrated his negotiations with China as a success.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAfter a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would, in turn, purchase 25 million metric tons of US soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiations would secure prosperity and security to millions of Americans.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut back in Washington, senators several from Trump's Republican Party have demonstrated their dissent with Trump's tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump's tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is still much higher than we've had.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt still will lead to increased prices, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new rule that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won't ultimately take effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Democrats can force a vote but not a result</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tBut Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmerican families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up, said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that in many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest, and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that Americans shouldn't be fooled by Trump's announcement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDonald Trump has folded, leaving American families and farmers and small businesses to deal with the wreckage from his blunders, from his erratic on again off again tariff policies, said the New York Democrat.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Republicans see Trump's trade policy</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tOverall, there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump's import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThose four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil, but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI agree with my colleagues that tariffs should be more targeted to avoid harm to Americans, said Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a floor speech. Yet, he added that Trump's negotiations are bearing fruit and praised his announcement that Beijing would allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans again.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans representing farm states were especially enthused by the announcement that China would be purchasing 25 million metric tonnes of soybeans annually, starting with 10 million metric tons for the rest of this year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said the deal with China absolutely justifies Trump's use of tariff threats to negotiate trade policy with other nations. He called the announcement huge news for Kansas farmers, but also acknowledged that they would still probably need financial help as they deal with the strain of losing their biggest customer for soybeans and sorghum.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not like you can snap your finger and send over $15 billion worth of sorghum and soybeans together overnight, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina had been the largest purchaser of US soybeans until this year. It purchased almost 27 million metric tons in 2024, so Trump's negotiated deal only guarantees to return soybean exports to China to less than their previous level.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called the purchase agreement a start.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAsked whether he agreed with Trump's assessment that his meeting with Xi had been a runaway success, Cramer smiled and said the president is nothing if not optimistic.</p><p></p></div>",

It has been the fastest-growing large economy in the world for the past three years, and we expect it to be a global driver of PE demand,” said Hari Gopalakrishnan, partner, head of India and co-head of services at Swedish PE firm EQT, during a panel discussion moderated by Nivedita Mookerji of <em>Business Standard</em>.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tGopal Jain, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer of Gaja Alternative Asset Management, the first PE firm planning a listing in India, said the country now has enough data and a clear trend to show that PE is on its way to becoming a mainstream sector.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“For many years, India has been the fastest-growing alternative market in the world, though that’s partly because we started from a small base. PE still punches below its weight,” said Jain.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tCurrently, he said, banks, insurance, and mutual funds dominate the mainstream financial sector. “We have $2.5 trillion in bank deposits in India. In comparison, PE within the alternative investment fund (AIF) space is just a small fraction. But now, alternatives are well on their way to becoming mainstream,” Jain added.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAbhishek Kabra, MD of Samara Capital, highlighted that over the past 25 years, PE has outperformed public markets globally by 6.7 per cent. “If you look at 10-year rolling returns, it’s a proven form to invest, park capital, and generate returns,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In the past four years, we’ve seen three years where global PE investment reached $2 trillion annually. It is certainly mainstream at the global level. In India too, we are seeing an increase in deal flow, a vibrant ecosystem, and a growing domestic pool of capital available to AIFs and fund managers. Among ultra-HNIs and family offices, about 7-8 per cent of allocations currently go toward AIFs,” Kabra said, adding that share is expected to rise to 15-16 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManish Kejriwal, founder and managing partner of Kedaara Capital, acknowledged that “around 2010, PE firms almost didn’t deliver returns to their LPs,” but said the situation has transformed with stronger exit opportunities through IPOs and sponsor-to-sponsor deals.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The IPO markets are obviously a very important component, and we now have sponsor-to-sponsor sales as well. We are in the process of selling a few companies. We’ve already taken nine companies public, and it’s a very robust exit market. Unless we return capital to our LPs, they won’t reinvest in India. That’s the fundamental change that happened in the past decade. The IPO markets have played a major role in that,” Kejriwal said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGopalakrishnan added that global market uncertainty is shifting investor focus to Asia and India. “If you look at Asia, again, India is one of the fastest-growing countries. And so global investors are looking more to Asia for growth. Within Asia, India is a bright spot. Incrementally, I would expect India to grow ahead of everybody else. But it's also of a small base,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJain highlighted that India is now the world’s fifth-largest economy, while the US, Japan, Europe, and China currently account for 90-95 per cent of global PE activity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Now that India is a large market, and with large markets comes a large economy, a large IPO market, large supply of entrepreneurs, large consumption base, all of that, private equity is set to grow and catch up to where it should be in the economy. In India, private equity punches below its weight because private equity worked only in part for the last 30 years --- the last five or six years. It started to work better, and has started to produce returns,” Jain said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

But one thing I will tell you, where India has a big, big advantage, is that we are built for the VUCA world. We are able to take uncertainty in our strength, and still go ahead. The biggest test of that, by the way, is something that we don't mention at all these days, it was demonetisation. It was the biggest test, and we passed it with flying colours,” said Bhattacharya.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShe was responding to a question from Prajakt Deolasee, chief technology officer, Turtlemint, on how India can wade in a global scenario when the majority of tech supply chains are controlled by US firms.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShe added: “This world is full of uncertainty. Every day there will be some uncertainty coming, but I think we are more than capable of taking that on, which is a great thing. Because there are a lot of other countries that cannot manage such uncertainty.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tResponding to a query from Puneet Asthana, executive director and CTO, Shriman Wealth and Shriram Group’s Capital Market Businesses on Large Language Model (LLMs), Bhattacharya said: “I am not seeing generation of a lot of in-house LLMs. But people are trying to make out how they can reduce the cost of using the LLMs that are currently there. So, whether it is in-house or whether they will be given by the current, established players or new players themselves, has to be seen. There is a very big effort to reduce costs, because unless you reduce it, you have too few users.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“It is not going to provide you the kind of sustenance, nor give any legs to the kind of valuations that you have at the end of the day. If you are going to justify those valuations, most people in the world use them,” Bhattacharya said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShe said that without reducing the costs, valuations of these companies cannot be justified beyond a point. “Otherwise, there is no way that those valuations can be justified beyond a point, and most people in the world won't be able to use them unless the costs come down.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn concerns raised by Mahavir Jindal, COO of Amazon Pay, about the valuation that companies are drawing, Bhattacharya said the euphoria is not warranted. “So, I will not speak about valuations. I'll leave that to the experts. I will say this much only that while there seems to be a hell of a lot of euphoria, you need to be grounded. The euphoria may not be warranted, but serious looking into it and serious partaking of it is warranted” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

In a conversation with <strong>Nivedita Mookerji</strong> at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Summit 2025, she warns that no organisation can survive without a robust information-technology (IT) backbone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you look at the world of technology after coming from SBI, and it has been five years at Salesforce now?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven at the bank, I strongly believed that any organisation not taking IT seriously will not sustain itself. Whether you’re a small family-run shop or in HR, logistics, manufacturing, or services — a strong IT backbone is essential. Technology is evolving at an unprecedented speed. We are now working with Agentic AI, and in just 13 months we have covered enormous ground, enabling Agentic enterprises. The pace of change is extraordinary, even within tech.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>From the world of SBI to this speed of technology, how has the transition been?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSBI teaches you to lead while learning. Because you’re transferred often — to different locations and across verticals and teams — you learn on your feet. I used to say that once I found a good hairdresser and tailor for my saree blouses, it was time to be transferred! This environment prepares you to add value immediately, which helped me in transitioning from 40 years in banking to working with people five generations younger.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>If you were to describe your journey as a woman leader, how would you put it?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI never thought of it in a precise way. For a woman in India with a career, it’s a constant calibration between family responsibilities and work. There are moments when you wonder if it’s worth it, but you must accept the reality and still move forward. Many women ask if I faced difficulty getting junior male colleagues to listen. I didn’t. Either I was lucky or any comments never reached me. I think what worked was my ability to communicate in a way that excited them as much as it did me. When people are convinced and energised, the gender of the leader doesn’t matter.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you share a few things you did for your women colleagues, apart from allowing sabbaticals?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe sabbatical was one, and I hoped other public-sector banks would follow, though they haven’t yet. I still hope they do, because it’s very helpful. I noticed many women were in platform roles, not in branch operations like their male colleagues. To qualify for the next promotion, they needed two years in an independent role and two years in rural service. Yet, in rural areas, landlords wouldn’t rent premises to single women. So, we identified rural branches women could commute to, or we rented accommodation in the bank’s name with multiple rooms for women branch managers. Many opted for these roles, and some told me those shared years were the best of their lives.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe also implemented cervical-cancer vaccination for all women staffers and their wards. And I tried to ensure that in major centres, we had at least one lady doctor — a gynaecologist or paediatrician — so women didn’t have to spend time outside arranging appointments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>There was a time when we had many woman CEOs across banks. Not any longer. What happened?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen I left, I left behind a strong pipeline of women, many of whom have achieved a lot. My former chief financial officer (CFO) is now CFO of the World Bank. Another headed Indian Bank and later NSDL. Women who were deputy managing director then have gone on to lead in several places. The glass ceiling still exists and takes time and effort to break. We were fortunate to have a strong cohort across PSBs, private and foreign banks. I recall a reception hosted by Raghuram Rajan (who was Reserve Bank of India governor from 2013 to 2016) — there were more sarees than suits in the room!</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>As a banker earlier, how do you look at the banking universe today from the outside?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator plays a significant role. The sector’s challenges today are different. One of the biggest now is technology — how banks use it to deliver better services, and how they reconcile the fact that work done by people can now be done by digital agents that can think, generate, and act. Banks must leverage tech to reach the last mile — to 600,000 villages where financial literacy is still lacking but crucial for unlocking India’s potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBFSI is the most digitally mature sector, so it must absorb new technology and use it daily to deliver the best to customers and show the way for other industries.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>During your SBI tenure, you took steps to bring in technology. SBI was called a “Smart Bank”. Looking back, could you have done more?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe did what we could at that time. Many things available today weren’t available then. When YONO launched, it was far ahead of private or foreign banks. The risk-management techniques we put in place, tech for credit underwriting, reaching the right customers through inclusion efforts, and the range of products — we pushed the envelope. With hindsight, perhaps we could have focused more on agility. You can’t be agile and nimble when you are working with systems that are very stodgy and are rooted in the past, which are a lot of legacy. You can’t write off all technical debt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Other than technology, was there any other unfinished business?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCustomer service will always remain a work in progress because expectations keep rising. Take technology: Customers want safety, but if we add multiple login layers, they complain; if login is easier, they worry about risk. We could have done better with customer literacy — explaining safety measures while retaining convenience. Every stakeholder, including the regulator, has a role.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe recent goods and services tax (GST) reforms are a landmark step towards making insurance more affordable and inclusive in India. The exemptions will help reduce insurance premiums, enhance affordability, and signal the government’s strong focus on insurance as an essential life necessity, the chiefs of four life insurance companies said at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a session moderated by <em>Manojit Saha</em> of <em>Business Standard</em>, Ratnakar Patnaik, managing director (MD) of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), said: “I agree this (GST exemption) will help insurance grow, it will become affordable. But at the same time, GST waiver alone will not help to increase penetration as such. It will surely facilitate it, but by itself is not sufficient to increase the penetration levels.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn early September, the GST Council announced a tax exemption on all individual life and health insurance policies, and their reinsurance was also exempted to boost penetration.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“It will surely help to bring down prices and increase penetration. Insurance is not a product which people will stand up tomorrow and buy. I would say for some time in September, it did happen. For a few days it did happen. That is a good indicator. But we will have to keep this alive in the mind of the customer, ensure that we take it to every household, let them know the benefits of bringing the prices down and increasing the sum insured,” said Tarun Chugh, MD &amp; CEO, Bajaj Life Insurance.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe insurers said that along with the GST waiver, they would need to educate people and inform them about improved affordability. Before the waiver, GST was a significant part of the cost, mainly for protection plans. There was a need to tell people about the enhanced affordability after the GST relief. Further, to increase penetration, there was a need for product innovation, more cross selling opportunities, and changes in distribution.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInsurers also believe that GST cuts have provided a great opportunity to boost the sale of protection products while also providing other value added services.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Mahesh Balasubramanian, MD &amp; CEO, Kotak Life Insurance, “As regards converting from a push product to a pull product, in every financial services business, there has been one lead product, which is the customer acquisition engine. I think this is the moment for term insurance. We can use this opportunity to seize the moment and make term insurance as the feeder product, where all of us acquire customers, and then see whether we can cross-sell and up-sell.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnup Bagchi, MD &amp; CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, said: “The excitement and this kind of positive discussion on life insurance with this kind of intensity is happening for the first time. The intensity has come because affordability has improved and it is a massive change...In channels which are not intermediated, which are online, where customers come in, all of us, we are certainly seeing 30-50 per cent increased traffic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFurther, while the insurers deliberated on the opportunities created by the GST waiver, they discussed several measures that have been taken to counter the impact of removal of the input tax credit (ITC). According to the companies, even as the benefits must be passed on to customers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors must bear the impact of the loss equally.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile some of the insurers are in discussions with their distributors on the same, LIC has passed the benefits to customers without making any changes in commissions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The government is sharing much of the burden as well, and so is the sector. There are basically four stakeholders. The prime and the most important is the customer, there is a manufacturer - which is the sector, then there is a distributor and the vendors are the fourth. The vendors provide a lot of services like the staffing units. The sector has shown and acted in unison: that we will not pass on anything negative to the customer. We have absorbed it. But eventually, it will have to be the three other stakeholders who will have to take on. The distributor also has to handle it and discussions are going on,” Chugh said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our priority continues to be the customer and we have passed on the entire benefit to the customer. That has been the approach even today. Secondly, as far as the GST on the commission is concerned, that also the corporation has absorbed. LIC has nearly 15,00,000 agents and many of them depend solely on income generated from life insurance,” Patnaik said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have to pass on the benefits to the customer, which all of us are committed to and already done. So, I think the productivity and efficiency of the industry has to go up. We have to look at all our costs and hope that ‘less is more’ should be the philosophy. So, we will probably take some time to reorganise. I don’t think this can change overnight. It can probably be a 6-12 month process where we look at each of the items and see how we can optimise,” Balasubramanian said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Growth of the industry is the only thing which mitigates all of this. If there is no growth in the industry, GST, no GST, nothing can get absorbed. So, the first thing we have to focus on is how do you give more to the customer. Chota premium, bada cover, turrant issuance, instant settlement. We must also understand that much of our distribution caters to the slightly more affluent part of the population. While, in other industries, growth is coming from alternate distribution. You will see in mutual funds, you know, the online distributors, they have certainly grown very large,” Bagchi said.</div></div>",
