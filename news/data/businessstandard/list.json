The company clocked its highest ever quarterly revenue at ₹7,589 crore, rising 7.6 per cent Y-o-Y.

Cipla’s stock fell by 2.5 per cent, ending the day’s trade at ₹1,540 apiece on BSE.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company said its Managing Director &amp; Global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Umang Vohra has decided to not seek reappointment upon completion of his current term on March 31, 2026.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVohra expressed strong optimism about the company's strategic direction, particularly highlighting the partnership with Eli Lilly for tirzepatide, a treatment for Type-2 diabetes and obesity.

He also confirmed the company remains directionally aligned with its $1 billion revenue guidance for the US business, expecting recent product launches to successfully sustain its growth trajectory.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“As for the $1 billion guidance for the US, directionally, yes, it should stay. When we gave that guidance, we said we would have launches that would substitute what we might potentially lose with Revlimid (lenalidomide), and directionally that guidance stays even today,” Vohra said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCipla also plans to expand its biosimilar portfolio beyond its first product agreement last quarter, with several new products added to the pipeline. The company is also enhancing manufacturing capacity within its joint venture, forming a clear blueprint for biosimilars growth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) recent move to simplify biosimilar studies and reduce unnecessary clinical testing, Cipla termed it a “huge positive” that will cut approval costs by $40-90 million per product, accelerate timelines, and encourage more players, especially from India, to enter the biosimilars space.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the company doesn’t expect the kind of intense competition seen in chemical generics, given the high investment still required. On MFN (most favoured nation) pricing, Cipla said the impact will likely hit branded biologics first, with limited margin pressure on biosimilars, which remain an attractive $3-5 billion opportunity per molecule.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCipla’s India business growth was led by robust performance across key therapies such as urology, cardiac, anti-diabetes, and dermatology. The trade generics segment also delivered strong double-digit growth, driven by execution excellence, new product launches, and the use of digital and technological interventions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring the quarter under review, Cipla introduced six new products, and entered the orthocare category to expand therapy coverage.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn North America, Cipla reported a 2 per cent decline in revenue at $233 million. Cipla said the next few quarters in the North America market will be a “tango” between the gradual phase-out of Revlimid and new product launches. The company expects to see the full impact of Revlimid’s decline in the coming quarter but anticipates this will be offset by a series of upcoming respiratory and peptide launches over the next three to four quarters. While timing uncertainties remain, Cipla reiterated that new launches are expected to fill the revenue gap.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor the quarter, the company launched filgrastim, its first biosimilar, in the US, marking a key step into high-growth therapeutic segments. Cipla also secured FDA approval for its generic glucagon injection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Africa business posted a 5 per cent Y-o-Y growth in dollar terms.

We need to change that,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSetting an ambitious target, he said the goal is to raise non-government NPS subscribers from 10 million to 250-300 million in the next five to six years using various digital platforms.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tNeed for financial literacy</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRamann said financial literacy will be the key to the wider adoption of products such as pensions, insurance, and mutual funds. He pointed out that financial awareness in India remains largely urban-focused, while smaller towns and semi-rural areas still lack basic financial planning guidance.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/finance/news/bfsi-summit-2025-live-updates-day-2-business-standard-banking-insurance-sector-finance-economy-125103000219_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">BFSI Summit LIVE: Biggest challenge is educating informal sector on investing, says PFRDA chief</a></strong></div>\n</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There’s tremendous aspiration in small towns; people want to grow their wealth and educate their children better,” Ramann said. He called for a network of certified financial planners across sectors, supported by minimum certification programmes through institutions like the National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM), to help financial planning reach the grassroots level.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also highlighted the role of bank sakhis and self-help group members, who already serve as trusted intermediaries in rural areas, as key players in spreading financial awareness. With India’s strong digital infrastructure and mobile penetration, he said, financial education content can be better targeted to specific groups.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tChallenges under new tax regime</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pfrda\" target=\"_blank\">PFRDA</a></strong> chief said the new tax regime has eliminated earlier incentives for NPS subscribers, making it harder to attract new investors. “Nearly 70 per cent of taxpayers are now under the new regime, where NPS tax benefits have disappeared. This is a challenge,” he said.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/specials/bs-events/india-private-equity-growth-unused-funds-maturity-bfsi-insight-summit-125103001302_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Unused funds sign of sector maturing, lot of room for growth: PE chiefs</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that globally, pension systems are supported through mandates or tax incentives and often help fund infrastructure and startups.

A pension, on the other hand, covers both accumulation and payout stages,” he explained.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ultimately, it’s for individuals to decide which product suits their needs and tax profile best,” Ramann said, adding that healthy competition between EPF and NPS will ensure better returns and choices for savers.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/industry/banking/zero-trust-cybersecurity-bfsi-summit-2025-experts-call-for-action-125103001150_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">As cybercrime surges, experts call zero trust a must for Indian BFSI</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said while EPF has historically worked well, “we should have competing products, that’s really where we’re moving forward.” Discussions are underway in the new regulatory forum to bring various pension products under a common framework for better coordination, he said.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tExpanding pension fund reach</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAsked when Indian pension funds could match global giants like CalPERS and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Ramann said the sector must first expand its base and attract more domestic participation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that India needs more homegrown pension funds, particularly in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, and cooperative networks. “We already have the world’s best payment systems.

Subsidiary Surya Nepal Private Ltd delivered resilient performance amid disruptions in Nepal during September 2025, it added.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nRevenue from operating businesses was up except in agri. ITC’s non-cigarette FMCG segment recorded revenue of Rs 6,059.12 crore, up 8.5 per cent Y-o-Y amid operational challenges.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe company said excessive rains in many parts of the country and the transition to the new goods and services tax (GST) regime posed operational challenges, causing short-term business disruptions.

Pre-tax profit from the segment, however, was up 1.5 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 453.61 crore.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe operating environment for paperboards, paper, and packaging remained challenging during the quarter, with sustained influx of low-priced supplies into global markets, including India, elevated domestic wood prices, and subdued realisations, the company said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe segment posted revenue of Rs 2,220.32 crore, up 5.02 per cent Y-o-Y.
