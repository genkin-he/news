Despite the top-order failure, Abhishek Sharma’s gritty half-century and a composed knock from Harshit Rana helped India recover from a disastrous start.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is focusing on promoting the responsible use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence in financial markets, strengthening cyber resilience, and preparing entities for quantum readiness, Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Friday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit, Pandey said technology would continue to redefine market functioning — from algorithmic trading to investment decisions. “True resilience lies in foresight — the ability to read trends early, anticipate risks, and prepare the system to withstand shocks. Building such capability, both within Sebi and across market institutions, will remain our key priority,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Sebi chief said India’s capital markets had become a key pillar of economic growth, underpinned by reforms that had made them more efficient, inclusive, and resilient. India’s financial system, he noted, now functions as an interconnected ecosystem linking banks, corporates, mutual funds, insurers, pension funds, and fintechs through a web of transactions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“These linkages bring efficiency and expand access to capital, but they also make the system more complex. A disruption in one segment can transmit rapidly to another,” he cautioned, stressing the need for coordination through the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite global challenges such as shifting trade policies, rising debt, and geopolitical tensions, Pandey said India’s financial system had remained stable. This resilience, he added, reflects the shared commitment of regulators and market participants to safeguard stability while enabling growth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe highlighted the widening reach of India’s capital markets, with the number of unique investors rising from about 40 million in FY19 to over 135 million. Market capitalisation has increased from 69 per cent of GDP in FY16 to around 129 per cent, while companies have raised nearly ₹7 trillion through equity and debt issuances in the current financial year till September. Investor participation from smaller towns is also growing, with about 18 per cent of mutual fund assets now originating from beyond the top 30 cities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey outlined several reforms aimed at strengthening market structure and investor protection. These include stronger governance frameworks for exchanges and clearing corporations, tighter liquidity norms and stress testing for mutual funds, and improved transparency in the corporate bond market. Sebi has also revised norms for SME IPOs and equity derivatives to ensure market integrity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo enhance ease of doing business, Sebi has simplified IPO and listing processes, digitised filings, streamlined KYC norms, and proposed relaxed requirements for NRIs. It has also set clear approval timelines and improved grievance redressal.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey said Sebi continues to foster market innovation. The regulator has expanded the scope of strategic investors in REITs and InvITs, reclassified REITs as equity for mutual fund investments, and introduced put options in non-convertible securities to enhance liquidity. Incentives have been revised to encourage mutual fund participation from women and investors in smaller towns, while Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) have been granted more flexibility under accredited investor-only schemes.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Collectively, these reforms have simplified operations, improved business conditions, strengthened governance, and reduced systemic risk — laying the foundation for a marketplace that is both resilient and welcoming to long-term capital,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRejecting the notion that regulation and growth are opposing forces, Pandey said well-designed regulation can support both. “The shorter T+1 settlement cycle increased efficiency and reduced systemic exposure simultaneously,” he noted, adding that improved disclosures and governance have enhanced the credibility of Indian listed entities globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey said Sebi is reviewing its regulatory framework to make it simpler and more contemporary. “Investor protection is not only about regulation; it begins with understanding,” he said, adding that the regulator will continue expanding financial literacy campaigns in regional languages.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“As we look to the future, our focus must remain on building a financial system that is strong yet agile, innovative yet responsible, and inclusive yet resilient,” Pandey concluded.</div></div>",

A new study published in the journal <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> suggests it can. The coronavirus may have lasting effects beyond the mother, potentially influencing how a baby’s brain develops.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tResearchers at Mass General Brigham, a leading research and academic medical centre in Boston that includes a network of hospitals, found that children born to mothers who had <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/pandemic-accelerated-brain-ageing-covid-study-uk-biobank-mental-health-causes-and-symptoms-125072500549_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Covid-19</a> during pregnancy faced a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, speech delays and motor coordination issues by the time they turned three.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe study, titled <em>Neurodevelopmental outcomes of 3-year-old children exposed to maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in utero</em>, analysed more than 18,000 births that took place during the first year of the pandemic.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>What did the study find?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe researchers tracked 18,124 mother–child pairs from March 2020 to May 2021. Among them, 861 women had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. By the time their children turned three, 16.3 per cent of those born to Covid-positive mothers had received a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, compared with 9.7 per cent of children whose mothers had not been infected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAfter adjusting for confounding factors such as age and pre-existing conditions, maternal Covid-19 infection was linked to a 29 per cent higher likelihood of <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/vaccines-autism-myth-doctors-debunk-sridhar-vembu-remarks-125102901122_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">neurodevelopmental disorders in children</a>.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Which children were most at risk?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe study found that male children were more likely to develop these disorders than female children. The highest risk appeared when the infection occurred during the third trimester, a crucial phase for brain development.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDr Andrea Edlow, senior author and Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham, explained in a press statement that “Covid-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother but to fetal brain development.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAnimal studies have shown that immune activation during pregnancy — the body’s inflammatory response to infection — can disrupt fetal brain development, which may help explain these findings.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Are all Covid-exposed babies at high risk?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe researchers emphasised that the overall risk remains low. Dr Roy Perlis, co-senior author from Mass General’s Department of Psychiatry, said in the statement that although infection increases the odds of developmental disorders, “the overall risk of adverse outcomes in exposed children likely remains low.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThis means that most babies born to mothers who had Covid-19 during <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/who-eu-trump-tylenol-autism-paracetamol-safety-pregnancy-125092300974_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">pregnancy </a>are likely to develop normally, but some may benefit from early developmental screening and support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAccording to the study, the link between infections in pregnancy and later neurodevelopmental conditions is not new. Influenza, rubella and Zika virus have all been associated with an increased risk of autism or developmental disorders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe researchers believe the effect may not stem from the virus directly crossing the placenta, but rather from maternal immune responses and inflammation that subtly alter the environment in which the fetal brain develops.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>What about Covid-19 vaccines and prevention?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tBecause the study’s timeframe was during the first pandemic year, most mothers involved were unvaccinated. This allowed researchers to isolate the effects of infection itself.

The company may use the unit at Maraimalai Nagar factory in the outskirts of the city as an export hub, with an annual production capacity of 235,000 units and production expected to start in 2029.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuilding on a letter of intent signed in September 2024, representatives of the company and the Tamil Nadu government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that outlines a strategy to leverage India’s “manufacturing prowess” for Ford plans. Senior company executives met Chief Minister M K Stalin on Friday. Sources said the plant will have an annual capacity of 235,000 units and start production in 2029.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MoU complements Ford India’s existing manufacturing infrastructure to produce and export engines. “We are pleased to advance our plans and confirm the Chennai plant’s vital role in Ford’s manufacturing network,” said Jeff Marentic, president of international markets group, Ford Motor Company.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are thankful to the government of Tamil Nadu for its continued support as we advance these plans. This decision reinforces our commitment to leveraging India's manufacturing prowess for future products,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDetails about engines the Chennai plant will produce and export markets will be shared closer to the start of production.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ford’s decision to commence manufacturing in Chennai will further energise the resurgent automotive sector of Tamil Nadu and it speaks volumes about the state's robust manufacturing ecosystem, highly skilled workforce, and excellent investor facilitation,” said Tamil Nadu Industries Minister T R B Rajaa.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe announcement comes two years after Ford stopped production at the Maraimalai Nagar factory in August 2022. Maramalai Nagar is considered as a lucrative destination as it is hardly 50 kms away from Chennai port and 74 kms from Ennore port. In addition to its proximity to Chennai, the plant is easily accessible to Bengaluru too, which is only 320 kms away by road. During the time of its exit, Ford India was staring at accumulated losses to the tune of around $2 billion over a decade that the company. At that time, through brands like EcoSport and Endeavour SUVs, it had a less than a 2 per cent share of the country's passenger vehicle market</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This is not just the start of manufacturing at the existing Ford facility, it is the State taking yet another step towards the future of the automotive industry with the production of next-gen engines. We remain committed to supporting Ford's operations here,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestment in the plant is expected to create more than 600 jobs, besides indirect employment in the automotive industry. Ford employs 12,000 people at its global business operations unit in Tamil Nadu. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tAt a secret location in rural Ukraine, columns of attack drones are assembled at night and in near silence to strike deep inside Russia.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir targets are strategic: oil refineries, fuel depots, and military logistics hubs. Since the summer, Ukraine's long-range drone campaign has ramped up dramatically, pounding energy infrastructure across Russia and stretching Moscow's air defences thin.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBuilt from parts made in a scattered network of workshops, these drones now fly much further than at any point in the war.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOfficers in body armour move with quick precision; headlamps glow red to stay hidden. Engines sputter like old motorcycles as exhaust fumes drift into the moonless night. Minutes later, one after another, the drones lift from a makeshift runway and head east. The strikes have caused gasoline shortages in Russia, even forcing rationing in some regions and underscoring a growing vulnerability in the country's infrastructure.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Drones hammer refineries</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWestern analysts say the attacks on energy infrastructure so far have had a serious but not crippling effect. Ukrainian drones have repeatedly hit 16 major Russian refineries, representing about 38 per cent of the country's nominal refining capacity, according to a recent review by the Carnegie Endowment, a US-based think tank.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut it argues the actual impact has been considerably more limited: most plants resumed operations within weeks, and Russia's refining output has been cushioned by idle capacity and existing fuel surpluses.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe deep strikes have, however, given Kyiv the initiative at an important moment. The United States and Europe are ramping up sanctions on Russia's oil industry even as Kyiv's request for US long-range Tomahawk missiles has stalled. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine's improved long-range strike capability is causing real damage forcing the Kremlin to import fuel and curb exports. We believe they've lost up to 20 per cent of their gasoline supply directly as a result of our strikes, he told reporters at a briefing in Kyiv.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAt the secret launch site, the commander overseeing the operation a broad-shouldered man identified by his call sign, Fidel, in accordance with Ukrainian military regulations watches through night-vision goggles as the drones climb into the star-filled sky.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDrones are evolving, Fidel told The Associated Press. Instead of flying 500 kilometers (310 miles), now they fly 1,000 ... Three factors go into a successful operation: the drones, the people and the planning. We want to deliver the best result. For us, this is a holy mission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ukraine thrives on no-frills weapons</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tMuch of Ukraine's fleet is homegrown. The Liutyi, a workhorse of the nightly attacks, is a waist-high craft with a sausage-shaped body, a propeller at the back, and a distinctive triangular tail.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt looks neither sleek nor intimidating more Home Depot than Lockheed Martin but the ease of assembly means it can be kept hidden and constantly tweaked: optimized to slip through heavily monitored frontline airspace.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTypical of Ukraine's no-frills war production philosophy, the Liutyi whose name means fierce in Ukrainian has become a symbol of national pride and recently featured on a local postage stamp.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe reach of these drones with some models doubling in range over the past year to routinely strike targets within a 1,000-kilometer radius of the border marks a shift in the geography of the conflict. Attacks a year ago damaged refineries in a much narrower range, mostly in western Russian border regions. Costs have also come down, further testing expensive air defense systems, with long-range drones now being produced in Ukraine for as little as USD 55,000.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>A shift in conflict geography</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhat we're seeing is that Ukraine is getting better at taking the war inside Russia, said Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at RANE, a global risk analysis firm. For most of the war, Russia operated on the assumption that its own territory was safe. That's no longer the case.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe strategic logic is attrition by logistics, he argued: by forcing Russia to reroute supplies and commit air defences to a wider area, Kyiv seeks to degrade Moscow's capacity to sustain large-scale operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Paris-based International Energy Agency says repeated drone strikes have cut Russia's refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels a day. That's triggered domestic fuel shortages and curbed exports of diesel and jet fuel, even as overall global oil production remains steady and prices stable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tKyiv's homegrown strike capability allows independent drone launches, bypassing the Western approval required for imported long-range weapons. That autonomy preceded tougher sanctions on Russia: allies escalated only after Ukraine had spent months hitting Russian refineries.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the ground, each mission is a study in tradeoffs. Fewer than 30 per cent of drones even reach the target area, so meticulous planning is essential, said Fidel, who reflected on the human cost. War has fallen to our generation so that we can fight for our kids and they can live in a free democratic country, he said. We are currently obtaining experience that will be used by every country in the world, and we are paying the price with our lives and the lives of our friends.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",
