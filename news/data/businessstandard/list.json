            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to make India’s tax system more trust-based, simpler, and technology-driven in the Union Budget 2026-27, with a focus on faster dispute resolution and easier Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rules. “India’s next leap requires a principle-based, technology-enabled, and trust-anchored tax system,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said after the industry body met the revenue secretary on Friday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCII noted that tax litigation continues to burden businesses, with more than five lakh appeals involving nearly ₹18 lakh crore pending before the commissioner (appeals). It asked the government to fast-track cases involving more than ₹100 crore and resolve them within one year through virtual hearings and close monitoring by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Penalty proceedings should be paused till the main appeal is settled, and draft orders should be shared for factual checks before being finalised, it suggested. CII also sought revival of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) under retired high court judges, “empowered to deliver binding rulings within six months”.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build taxpayer confidence, CII called for converting the existing taxpayer charter into a legal Taxpayer Rights Charter guaranteeing time-bound refunds, faceless assessments, and accountability for administrative delays. It also flagged issues in the Central Processing Centre (CPC) system for return processing and asked for “improved protocols ensuring that only apparent mistakes are adjusted automatically and that taxpayers can request virtual hearings when required”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn direct tax simplification, CII said the TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework — with more than 35 categories and multiple rates — has become too complex and affects business liquidity. It recommended reducing the framework to two or three broad rates, exempting transactions between Goods and Services Tax (GST)-registered entities, and clarifying that no TDS should apply to the GST portion of a payment. “Tax simplification is not a concession; it is an investment in governance efficiency,” Banerjee said. “When rules are clear and systems are digital, compliance becomes automatic and disputes become exceptional.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn indirect taxes and customs, CII pitched a one-time settlement scheme for old disputes, longer validity for advance rulings, and full digital processing of customs through Application Programming Interface (API)-based systems. It suggested a roadmap for “paper-free customs by 2028” with e-refunds, e-adjudication, and e-appeals. CII also called for rationalising tariffs by consolidating exemption notifications and permitting a single appeal for multiple bills of entry (BoE) where issues are common, along with automatic release of bonds once export obligations are met.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo improve predictability, CII suggested a multi-year corporate tax roadmap and removal of prosecution for minor and unintentional errors under both direct and indirect tax laws. “CII’s proposals are not about cutting taxes, but they are about cutting friction,” Banerjee said, adding that a trust-based compliance system can boost revenues without hurting the exchequer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India has already shown the world that large-scale reforms like GST 2.0 can succeed,” he said. “If we now make our tax systems as simple and predictable as they are digital and fair, we will not only raise revenues more efficiently but also build the foundations of an economy that inspires confidence — both at home and abroad.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The increase in indirect tax collections was modest at 3.2 per cent, with a 5.2 per cent contraction in Customs duties and a 4.8 per cent growth in goods and services tax and excise duty collections.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNet tax revenue during H1FY26 contracted 2.8 per cent, with collections reaching 43.3 per cent of the full-year target, compared with 49 per cent during the same period a year ago.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, a 30.5 per cent surge in non-tax revenues — buoyed up by a record ₹2.7 trillion dividend from the Reserve Bank of India — offset the dip in net tax revenue.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tInvestors should keep expectations realistic, stay invested with discipline, and focus on asset allocation as markets move through a more measured phase, chief investment officers (CIOs) of leading fund houses said in a panel discussion at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, said India’s overall position remains stable, supported by sound macroeconomic factors. “India is in a better shape than a year ago,” he said during a panel discussion moderated by Samie Modak</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have been telling investors to follow asset allocation, but we are now slightly more positive on equities than last year. We are in a moderate return situation but better than last year.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSailesh Raj Bhan, Chief Investment Officer – Equity, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said investors’ return expectations have not changed much despite recent market behaviour. “When we meet people, we realise return expectations haven’t shifted down,” he said. “Something or the other keeps working in different markets, so investors continue to look for quick gains.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said markets have become more balanced, with large caps delivering earnings-led performance. “Expectations should be moderate and aligned with earnings growth,” Bhan said. “The large-cap space is becoming more sensible, but this is not a period for very high returns.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMahesh Patil, CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, said that while valuations have eased from earlier highs, the recovery ahead will likely be gradual. “A year ago, valuations were at a premium, and growth had slowed. Now liquidity conditions are easier, and valuations are more reasonable,” he said. “With growth expected to improve, the outlook looks better than it did last year.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRajeev Thakkar, CIO, PPFAS Mutual Fund, said investors should stay focused on their investment plans and avoid expecting unusually high returns. “The past year has seen limited movement in stock prices, though earnings have grown modestly,” he said. “There are still pockets where valuations are elevated. Equities can do better than fixed income over time, but expectations should remain realistic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom the debt market perspective, Rajeev Radhakrishnan, CIO – Fixed Income, SBI Mutual Fund, said the backdrop has turned favourable. “Debt valuations look more comfortable,” he said. “Inflation is not a concern, and liquidity conditions are supportive.” He added that while some policy easing may continue, most of it has already taken place.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRadhakrishnan said hybrid and asset allocation products are likely to attract more investor interest. “Flows into short-term fixed income funds have been limited,” he said. “Given the current tax framework, allocations to debt are increasingly coming through hybrid products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeveral fund managers said a balanced investment mix helps investors handle periods of uncertainty. Naren said his fund house has been recommending hybrid and multi-asset products for the past two years. “These products help investors maintain balance during market corrections,” he said. “We have closed some small- and mid-cap funds for new subscriptions to avoid concentration risk.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBhan said maintaining clear communication with investors is also important. “Our focus is on explaining the kind of risk being taken,” he said. “We encourage investors to commit money they will not need for at least five to seven years, and to invest through systematic investment plans. Asset allocation helps manage risk better.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPatil said strong inflows can make deployment more complex in certain market segments. “When large amounts come into specific categories such as small caps, it becomes difficult to invest without affecting valuations,” he said. “We manage this by spreading investments across a wider number of stocks.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThakkar said his fund avoids being fully invested at all times if suitable opportunities are not available. “We prefer to deploy when we find reasonable valuations,” he said. “If we don’t, we wait. It’s better to stay patient than to force deployment.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn new listings, Bhan said funds need to be selective. “In any strong market, supply increases,” he said. “Our focus is on buying the right business at the right price. If that does not fit, we stay away.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNaren said that large inflows into equities shift the responsibility of allocation directly to investors. “In this cycle, most capital is being allocated through mutual funds and similar products, not banks,” he said. “If allocation goes wrong, the investor bears the risk. Many believe equities are risk-free, but that is not the case.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAcross equity and debt, the panellists emphasised discipline, diversification, and a focus on long-term goals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Investing is not arithmetic,” Naren said. “No one can predict markets, but maintaining asset allocation and a diversified approach helps investors have a steadier experience.”</div></div>",
