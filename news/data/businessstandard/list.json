He stated that HMIL was a carmaker that did not give any price discounts even when sales were low during the GST transition period (August 15–September 21). “That has also supported our margin growth in this quarter, in addition to what Hariharan has said.

Since then, smartphones have changed from a connectivity delivery mechanism to full high power computing mechanism.

Today, you have UPI device banding.

Then the cost can also come down, as we won’t need a screen. Evolving from digital reach to digital trust is important. The next 300-400 million people would transact digitally when they feel secure.

These comments came hours after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, where Beijing agreed to delay by a year the introduction of its latest round of rare earth export restrictions, originally slated to take effect on November 8.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe four aforementioned firms granted import licences are key suppliers to the Indian automobile industry, which has been hit hard by China’s curbs on exports of rare earth materials -- essential components in electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, aircraft and weapons systems.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tNew Delhi had raised the issue during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to India in August, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Xi in Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit.

Trump said Xi has been “buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China. And, you know, I can say India's been very good on that front.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn the Chabahar port waiver, Jaiswal confirmed that India’s exemption from US sanctions will run for six months. The US had earlier indicated that activities linked to the Iranian port could attract penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act, revoking a waiver granted in 2018. Chabahar forms a key node in the International North–South Transport Corridor connecting India with Central Asia and Europe.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tWith the Quad Summit unlikely to be held this year, Jaiswal said the grouping -- comprising India, Japan, the US, and Australia -- “remains a valuable forum for discussions on shared interests,” adding that any leaders’ summit is arranged “through diplomatic consultations among the four partners.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAmid renewed tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the MEA reiterated India’s support for Kabul. “Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories,” Jaiswal said. “It seems to think it has the right to practise cross-border terrorism with impunity.

They were speaking with <em>Ajinkya Kawale</em> of <em>Business Standard</em> during a panel discussion titled ‘Post-UPI, Indian Payment Players Look to Foreign Shores’.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Very often, we compare and say there is more money to be made overseas. We’re used to very thin margins thanks to our large population. Anything higher than that [domestic payment margins] seems very appealing to us,” said Arif Khan, chief innovation officer, Razorpay.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe sharper focus on markets such as Southeast Asia, Asia-Pacific, and the US comes at a time when fintechs are targeting profitability while also looking to deepen their global presence.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWith UPI currently merchant discount rate-free in India and its growth supported by government incentives, the platform’s international expansion has gained momentum. There are now more than 450 million UPI users in the country.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In the Indian market, with UPI at almost no cost, monetisation is difficult because there’s still a cost of innovation and compliance. At the same time, everyone needs profitability. So, one looks for opportunities where you can monetise and make money,” said Harsh Gupta, chief revenue officer, Cashfree Payments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, Indian fintechs’ penetration in cross-border transactions remains limited, even as firms enhance services and lower costs for customers.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There are opportunities to reduce costs depending on how a business grows — through better deals with banks, payment partners, and others. Cross-border payments are growing. But in India, less than 5 per cent of these are handled by fintechs — one of the lowest figures globally,” said Sanjay Tripathy, cofounder and chief executive officer, BriskPe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExecutives agreed that stablecoins, despite their global popularity, are unlikely to see large-scale adoption in India soon due to compliance concerns.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Few countries like us have taken such a lead in deploying the central bank digital currency (CBDC) model. The way trade happens through CBDCs, the flows have to align. Stablecoins are becoming popular, but for trade, I don’t see adoption,” said Rahul Jain, chief financial officer, NTT Data Payment Services.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInstead, the presence of CBDCs is expected to enable targeted initiatives such as direct benefit transfers. “CBDCs are more of a tool to reach the poor and Tier-III citizens of our country. But the underlying distributed architecture in a world where everything is centralised — that’s going to be a challenge,” said Khan of Razorpay.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, he added that while SWIFT was “a great solution”, it remained a standard “not set by us” and was expensive. “The banks love it because there’s a passback that comes to them through that system. From a fintech point of view, there’s no passback for us. SWIFT is a big challenge,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGupta noted that the cost of moving funds still varies widely across jurisdictions. “When you think of cross-border payments, the first things that come to mind are risk, compliance, taxation, speed, and cost. Today, the cost of moving funds is inconsistent across countries unless there are well-defined trade agreements and clear regulations,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTripathy added that compliance continues to be a major hurdle across markets. “The primary thing that needs to happen is compliance. Everyone struggles because compliance requirements vary across countries, instruments, and players,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Jain outlined plans to enable UPI payments for Indian travellers in Japan after NTT Data Payment Services signed a memorandum of understanding with NPCI International Payments, the overseas arm of the National Payments Corporation of India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“A lot of new-age apps like PayPay or Docomo Pay — we’re trying to engage them through incentive programmes to boost QR penetration. But when you look at large merchants, integrations there are very different from what we have in India,” he said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tInternationalisation of Indian rupee is not to replace the dollar but to reduce risk for Indian businesses by enabling more transactions in rupees, Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor <strong>T Rabi Sankar</strong> said in a fireside chat with <strong>Tamal Bandopadhyay</strong> during the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit on Thursday. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>The RBI has issued new norms for external commercial borrowing (ECB) and foreign exchange liberalisation -- on foreign currency borrowing by Indian companies -- removing cost caps, widening eligible borrowers and lenders, expanding end users, and raising the borrowing limit to 300 per cent. Why are we opening up so many things so fast?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThese are not short-term measures. If you look at the RBI’s stance on capital account convertibility, we have consistently said that it is a process, not an event. In this spirit, we have been gradually liberalising the capital account. Today, barring a few constraints such as cost caps and amount limits on ECBs, most inward capital flows are liberalised.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhat remains more under control is the extent of outward flows, which aligns with our stage of development. Regarding ECBs, we have taken several steps over the years to simplify processes, such as allowing derivative use and commodity hedging. Trade flows are also being liberalised as part of the effort to make foreign exchange transactions smoother and more convenient.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe current ECB proposals, still in draft form, aim to ensure that only financially strong entities borrow abroad. Instead of cost caps, we now link permissible borrowing to a firm’s leverage. Once this framework is finalised, cost caps and other limits may no longer be necessary. This is not a sudden move; it’s the continuation of a decades-long process of gradual liberalisation. We are still in the discussion stage and will finalise the framework after reviewing feedback, likely in the next couple of months.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>In the backdrop of global uncertainties, what would be the next stage of relaxations in terms of capital account convertibility, since the Indian rupee is only partially convertible on the capital account?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tTrade is largely free, with only procedural requirements such as repatriation timelines. We have already released two draft proposals to simplify trade regulations, reducing over 100 directives to a single comprehensive framework. ECB liberalisation is part of this broader effort. Our priority remains on facilitating inflows of capital first, followed by calibrated outflows.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>We start a policy and want to see results immediately. But many reforms take a long time to bear fruit. How do you see this in the context of internationalisation of the rupee?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tPolicy-making often involves preparing the ground for the future. Digital payments, for instance, took years after the introduction of two-factor authentication to really take off. Similarly, internationalising the rupee is a long-term process. The goal isn’t to replace the dollar, that’s unrealistic, but to reduce risk for Indian businesses by enabling more transactions in rupees. This reduces currency exposure for exporters and contributes to a more balanced global system where multiple currencies play a role. Over time, as India grows into a top global economy, the rupee must become more widely accepted in cross-border trade. We are creating the conditions for that transition, even if adoption takes time.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Despite all the talk, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) hasn’t really taken off. Where is CBDC today, and why should I use it if I already have UPI, which gives me interest on deposits while CBDC does not?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tYou’ve asked two questions — where CBDC is, and why CBDC. Let me take them one by one.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the “where”: CBDC has been progressing as a pilot since 2022. We are not rushing it because most countries are still experimenting and studying its impact. Over 100 million transactions have taken place so far, but we are going slow to understand potential effects; for instance, whether CBDCs could replace bank deposits.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe are technologically ready, but our approach is cautious. We are also testing “programmable” CBDC use cases such as government benefits or education loans that can be spent only on specific items.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the “why”: CBDC enables things that existing systems can’t, notably programmability and cross-border efficiency. Domestic payment systems like UPI work well, but cross-border transfers remain slow and expensive. CBDC can settle such transactions instantly and cheaply, without intermediaries. That’s why we see CBDC as uniquely useful, though the global understanding of token money is still evolving.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is there any change in your approach to cryptocurrency, especially with stablecoins being legalised in some countries?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNo, our stance remains unchanged. Both unbacked cryptocurrencies and stablecoins pose significant risks. Our analysis continues to show that cryptocurrencies do not serve any legitimate purpose that existing forms of money cannot serve better. Unbacked cryptos have no underlying cash flows or issuers, and hence, no intrinsic value.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStablecoins, while backed, pose risks of currency substitution and loss of monetary sovereignty, especially for emerging markets like India. We believe CBDC can meet all legitimate use cases of stablecoins without those risks.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>There’s some confusion in the payments space. For years we’ve had two-factor authentication, but now there’s an alternative authentication framework. Can you explain the new system?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tActually, we may not even have needed a regulation. Two-factor authentication has become synonymous with OTPs (one-time passwords), though technology now allows more secure alternatives. Fraudsters evolve, so authentication methods must evolve too.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe new framework allows flexibility; OTP remains valid but is no longer the only option. The idea is to encourage innovation and better security as technology evolves.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>On foreign exchange reserves, the RBI has churned a substantial portion in recent years, making profits by selling old holdings and buying at higher prices. With the old stock depleting, will your ability to generate profits and pay dividends to the government reduce?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tYes, if earnings change, surplus transfers will also change. But that’s incidental. The central bank doesn’t operate with profit as an objective. Surplus transfers come mainly from seigniorage income, which belongs to the people and is rightly passed on to the government.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs for valuation, we follow standard accounting practices: holdings are recorded at average acquisition cost, and profits or losses are booked against that. So even though the average cost rises over time, it balances out. Depending on exchange rate movements, sales can yield either profit or loss.</div></div>",
