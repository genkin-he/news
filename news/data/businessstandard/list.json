            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tArtificial intelligence, or AI, has had an influence in the way we invest in stocks. While it helps you narrow the list of opportunities, it has not reached a point where it can replace wealth managers, points out <strong>Shankar Sharma</strong>, founder, GQuants, in a fireside chat with <strong>A K Bhattacharya</strong>.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>To what extent is your investment philosophy data- and AI-driven?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMy needle of investing has moved from being very traditional to becoming 80-90 per cent data- and AI- driven. That has been my transformation as an investor.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, I was an early adopter of AI and quant-driven thinking. And again, to clarify, it’s not that I use only AI but where it comes into play. It is giving me a breadth and scale of opportunity seeking, which I would not be able to do humanly, or even with a team.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, in a sea of 10,000 companies, for example, how do you find five, 10, 15, or 20 good ones? AI is giving me that today. Now, after that, the human part of me kicks in to further refine it down to the best five, or the best eight, or the best 10. But getting to that, it was a needle in a haystack. Now, the haystack has become much easier for me to understand. That's how I am using AI. Thus, my investment philosophy is simply that instead of taking a small number of large bets, as I would when I was a human being, because of AI, I can take a large number of small bets and a small number of large bets simultaneously.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will AI replace humans in investing or in financial services?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think it will not happen because we human beings will prevent AI from becoming that important because it will take away our jobs. For example, if a mutual fund chief investment officer gets too much AI into his firm, tomorrow his job is in danger.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAI will have a natural check because of our vested interests and balance embedded in it. It will have a role, but to expect that everything will go from human beings and go to AI … I don't think that will happen.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You are perceived as a contrarian. Will that change with the advent of AI?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI don’t think AI will change who you intrinsically are. But here is where the danger lies and I am mindful of that. And I try to limit the use of AI in my day-to-day life.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter using AI tools in the past one or two years, I have realised that for getting perspectives or getting data, I find you can but it (AI) will learn what you want the answer to be. So, on a topic it will start giving you answers that it senses you want.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt reads your mind on that topic and then starts feeding you answers that support your thesis. This is exactly what you don't want when you are trying to think differently and be a contrarian.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>We have not been able to get that right mix of AI and our intelligence to help navigate this difficult, complex world. How should the financial sector use AI?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAI is too new for us to form conclusions on whether it will reshape financial services in a big way. I mean, computers came and they reshaped it. AI will also reshape it. How much we have no idea, nobody can tell.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhat I do know is that AI is reshaping itself. Even AI doesn’t know where it will go five years from now. There are many flaws in it. It gives you wrong information and sometimes fabricates it. This destroys confidence.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhy were we looking at AI? Because it is better than a human in giving me correct data. But I find it gives me rubbish most of the time. So, now the process I follow is I check the same information on four different platforms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think it is imperfect right now. In fact, vastly imperfect. In some cases, dangerously imperfect.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>In addition to how one should deal with AI, what are the other things investors should bear in mind?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReturns in global markets this year have been off the charts. It’s been one of the best years of my life as an investor because I invest globally. And I have been spoilt for choice this year, which is, on a policy basis, supposedly the most tumultuous year. So, clearly there is something markets are reading and I think markets are reading it right.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier, in investing, America was the only game in town. If you missed the American bull market, you were pretty much dead. Today, that’s not the case.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI am happy that America is slowing a bit because of its policies. The rest of the world is restructuring, reshaping. It is opening up more opportunities for me as an investor.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI do not see that as a negative at all. If anything, it is better from a portfolio management standpoint to have 15-20 good markets rather than have just one.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Any other learning from this world of uncertainty?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think the biggest uncertainty for an investor today should be the fact that if you (the investor) are exposed only to a single market and that market for whatever reason might have a very uncertain situation, you then have a genuine problem. Therefore, diversify your investment beyond just the comfort zone. Fortunately, tools, including AI, are available to help you do that.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The Indian economy is still predominantly dependent on oil import. What’s your view on how oil will impact the Indian financial sector, Indian stocks, and Indian markets?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExploration can reshape our oil and gas situation over the long term. In the interim, I don't think it’s in anybody’s interests, not even producers’, to have high oil prices. I think there is a consensus in the producing world that this is a good, happy price that generally keeps the world satisfied. We love bull markets in equities, gold, silver, and real estate. What is the bull market we hate? A bull market in oil. Only seven or 10 countries love it. But even at $60, I think they are pretty well prepared.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What are the reasons for the bull market in gold and silver and your advice for investors?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe can attribute and ascribe reasons to the bull market in gold. But as regards silver, I don’t think there are good reasons. Now people say that it is for industrial use. But that has always been the case. Gold is in a good place right now. But I am not saying the reason for that is people are de-dollarising and moving away. I think the opposite is true.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs gold is going up, people are moving from the dollar to gold. It’s not the other way around. That’s my view.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOther than oil, I am generally bullish on commodities. And I think there are plenty of reasons. But the reasons will change at some point in time. So, I am not a big believer in making long-term forecasts on commodities.</div></div>",

China then arrested two Canadian citizens and charged then with espionage.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTies didn't improve much even after the 2021 release of the two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and the Chinese executive, Meng Wenzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMore recently, relations have been shaken by Canada's decision to levy a 100 per cent tariff on electric vehicles from China in 2024 and a 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminum. China has offered to remove its import taxes on some Canadian products if Canada drops the EV tariff.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCanada made the move last in tandem with the US.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Canadian statement said that both leaders directed their officials to move quickly to resolve trade issues and irritants and discussed solutions for specific products such as EVs, canola and seafood.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tXi called for expanding pragmatic cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade and energy. Both Canada and China have been hit by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCanadian canola producers, seafood exporters and pork farmers are dealing with steep Chinese tariffs in retaliation for the 100 per cent tariff Canada imposed on Chinese electric vehicles, batteries and other goods last year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina's ambassador in Ottawa recently said Beijing would drop its levies if Ottawa cancels the EV tariffs.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe attempt at rapprochement comes as Carney looks to diversify Canada's trade away from the United States and as Trump says he plans raise tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10 per cent. Canada's free trade agreement with the US is up for review.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

There are now over 35 active business segments operating in the centre.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDipesh Shah, executive director, IFSCA, said the time was ripe for GIFT City to be seen alongside global peers, such as Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Singapore.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I would definitely answer positively that GIFT City has arrived. It is now in everyone’s interest to make it comparable to Singapore and other global financial centres — rapidly and decisively,” Shah said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe financial hub is also attracting foreign companies exploring direct listings on its international exchanges.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve been doing roadshows over the past year to engage companies looking to raise between $50 million and $200 million.

The idea was to bring an emerging-market perspective to global ratings, which has long been dominated by US-based agencies,” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKasture added that in 17 of those 39 markets, global rating agencies later revised their views in a direction consistent with CareEdge’s ratings — validating the model’s relevance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile favourable tax policies have helped accelerate activity at GIFT City, experts urged the government to extend the existing 10-year tax holiday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There’s a clear case for extension,” said Tushar Sachade, Partner, Price Waterhouse &amp; Co LLP. “Providing 15–20 years of certainty would offer businesses a long-term horizon and greater confidence in setting up operations.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSachade also called for clarity in the next Union Budget on taxation rules for certain categories of funds, particularly outbound schemes. “Unlike inbound structures, outbound public funds lack a defined tax regime and currently rely on the trust taxation framework. We also need clear safe-harbour norms,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExperts highlighted that IFSCA operates with full policy autonomy and globally aligned regulations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If an Indian entity regulated by a domestic agency wants to operate in GIFT City, it needs a no-objection certificate from that regulator. But for foreign firms, the licensing process is direct with IFSCA,” said Shah, citing the example of a Taiwanese bank setting up operations without an India presence.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgreeing with this, Kasture added: “Some products not permitted in the domestic market, such as private credit ratings, are allowed at GIFT. The regulatory philosophy is international, not domestic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBalasubramaniam further said that the introduction of zero-day expiry contracts on GIFT Nifty aligns with global standards and “should not be seen through a domestic-market lens.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also highlighted the proposed Global Access Provider framework, designed to enable investors and institutions in GIFT City to access a wider range of overseas assets and products.</div></div>",

The gain exceeded the 18 per cent growth that analysts had expected and marked the biggest year-over-year rise since OpenAI’s ChatGPT came on the scene in late 2022.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak Podcast on Apple, Spotify and other Podcast Platforms.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe results reinforce the logic that major technology companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have been using to justify record spending levels on data center construction — that demand for AI is outstripping the supply of global computing capacity. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon’s results came a day after investors punished Meta Platforms Inc. for projecting even greater spending in 2026. Unlike Microsoft and Google, Meta isn’t a major cloud-computing provider to outside customers. That means its spending spree could be riskier.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon’s shares jumped 12 per cent to $249.42 as the markets opened in New York on Friday, the biggest intraday jump since April.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe stock’s performance had lagged behind that of its industry peers this year, with investors worrying that the company has yet to demonstrate enough benefit from its artificial intelligence products. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft’s Azure cloud business grew at almost twice the rate of AWS, while Google Cloud posted 33.5 per cent growth.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Clearly AWS continues to drive the bus here, with acceleration in growth and better-than-expected operating margin,” analysts with William Blair said in a research note after earnings. “The acceleration helps ease some of the narrative around the company’s lack of strategic vision or advantage in the emerging AI landscape.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy has pushed the company’s capital spending to a record in the quarter to keep up in an arms race with its biggest rivals. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestor expectations for Amazon’s cloud business were relatively low heading into Thursday’s earnings report after the company in recent quarters cited constraints in getting new data centers online. Jassy and other executives had said they were optimistic about the business, though they stopped short of forecasting a reacceleration of growth.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tJassy opened a conference call with analysts after the results were released by cheering the prospects for AWS and rattling off figures on the impact of AI on the company’s businesses, most of which Amazon hadn’t disclosed previously. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company estimates that Rufus, the shopping chatbot embedded in its retail apps, will help deliver an additional $10 billion in annual sales. Connect, the company’s call center product that is widely seen as its most successful software offering for office workers, is on track to pull in $1 billion in annualized revenue, Jassy said. Bedrock, the AWS marketplace for businesses to tap into AI models, could ultimately be as big a business as EC2, the computing service that is one of the cloud unit’s primary money makers.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have momentum,” he said. “You can see it.” <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring the quarter that ended Sept. 30, Amazon’s total sales rose 13 per cent to $180.2 billion, the company said in the statement. Analysts, on average, were anticipating $177.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder Jassy, Amazon has been working to improve the profitability of the retail business by stepping up automation and selling higher-margin ads and other services to online merchants. That work has receded from the headlines as investors focus on the company’s battle in the market for AI. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tLike its biggest rivals, Amazon has invested heavily in data centers and chips to build and operate AI models capable of generating text or images and automating processes. Capital expenditures rose 61 per cent to $34.2 billion in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe power capacity of the AWS data center fleet has doubled since 2022, and Jassy said he expected it to double again by 2027. Last week, the unit suffered its biggest outage in years. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThough Amazon has sought to position its cloud business as a marketplace for a broad range of AI tools, for now, it has a lot riding on a single partner: Anthropic PBC, the maker of the Claude chatbot and software coding assistant.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon is backing Anthropic with an investment of $8 billion, and built the startup a massive complex of data centers and custom AWS AI chips. That system, called Project Rainier, is up and running, the company said this week. Amazon said its Trainium2 chip was “fully subscribed” and represented a multibillion-dollar business.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tGoogle recently announced a deal to provide Anthropic with some of its own chips. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the third quarter, Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion, which included a $2.5 billion charge related to a legal settlement announced last month with the Federal Trade Commission over Prime subscriptions and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. The company said earlier this week that it would cut about 14,000 corporate workers and warned of further terminations in 2026. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmazon projected that revenue in the holiday quarter would be $206 billion to $213 billion, meeting analysts’ estimates. Operating profit will be $21 billion to $26 billion, also in line with expectations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the third quarter, sales generated by the online store business increased 10 per cent to $67.4 billion. Advertising unit revenue jumped 24 per cent to $17.7 billion. Third-party seller services from merchants who use Amazon’s e-commerce site increased 12 per cent to $42.5 billion.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to make India’s tax system more trust-based, simpler, and technology-driven in the Union Budget 2026-27, with a focus on faster dispute resolution and easier Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rules. “India’s next leap requires a principle-based, technology-enabled, and trust-anchored tax system,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said after the industry body met the revenue secretary on Thursday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCII noted that tax litigation continues to burden businesses, with more than five lakh appeals involving nearly ₹18 lakh crore pending before the commissioner (appeals). It asked the government to fast-track cases involving more than ₹100 crore and resolve them within one year through virtual hearings and close monitoring by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Penalty proceedings should be paused till the main appeal is settled, and draft orders should be shared for factual checks before being finalised, it suggested. CII also sought revival of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) under retired high court judges, “empowered to deliver binding rulings within six months”.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build taxpayer confidence, CII called for converting the existing taxpayer charter into a legal Taxpayer Rights Charter guaranteeing time-bound refunds, faceless assessments, and accountability for administrative delays. It also flagged issues in the Central Processing Centre (CPC) system for return processing and asked for “improved protocols ensuring that only apparent mistakes are adjusted automatically and that taxpayers can request virtual hearings when required”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn direct tax simplification, CII said the TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework — with more than 35 categories and multiple rates — has become too complex and affects business liquidity. It recommended reducing the framework to two or three broad rates, exempting transactions between Goods and Services Tax (GST)-registered entities, and clarifying that no TDS should apply to the GST portion of a payment. “Tax simplification is not a concession; it is an investment in governance efficiency,” Banerjee said. “When rules are clear and systems are digital, compliance becomes automatic and disputes become exceptional.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn indirect taxes and customs, CII pitched a one-time settlement scheme for old disputes, longer validity for advance rulings, and full digital processing of customs through Application Programming Interface (API)-based systems. It suggested a roadmap for “paper-free customs by 2028” with e-refunds, e-adjudication, and e-appeals. CII also called for rationalising tariffs by consolidating exemption notifications and permitting a single appeal for multiple bills of entry (BoE) where issues are common, along with automatic release of bonds once export obligations are met.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo improve predictability, CII suggested a multi-year corporate tax roadmap and removal of prosecution for minor and unintentional errors under both direct and indirect tax laws. “CII’s proposals are not about cutting taxes, but they are about cutting friction,” Banerjee said, adding that a trust-based compliance system can boost revenues without hurting the exchequer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India has already shown the world that large-scale reforms like GST 2.0 can succeed,” he said. “If we now make our tax systems as simple and predictable as they are digital and fair, we will not only raise revenues more efficiently but also build the foundations of an economy that inspires confidence — both at home and abroad.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
