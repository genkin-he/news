It said an NDA government in the state would “top up” by an additional Rs 3,000 the Rs 6,000 that the state’s 8.7 million farmers receive annually from the Centre under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, and promised minimum support prices (MSP) for maize, paddy, wheat and pulses.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Focus on Bihar’s youth and rural population</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar has one of the youngest populations in India, with an estimated 58 per cent of its 127 million people under 25 years of age, according to a NITI Aayog projection in 2023. As much as 88 per cent of the state’s population continues to live in rural areas, and 49.6 per cent of its working population is employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, with 26 per cent in services, 18.4 per cent in construction and 5.7 per cent in manufacturing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn his address to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) polling booth workers in the state on October 23, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged them to talk to Bihar’s youth about the purported “jungle raj” or lawlessness that allegedly prevailed before 2005. NDA strategists consider it important to remind millions of young voters, many of whom are disillusioned with the lack of opportunities, but were too young or not yet born to recall the pre-2005 period before the BJP-Janata Dal (United) government was formed.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>EBC and women-centric promises to retain core voter base</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn its outreach to the EBCs, the NDA has promised Rs 1 million in financial assistance to professional groups within the category. It also proposed setting up a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge to study the socio-economic conditions of EBCs. The EBCs comprise 112 castes, accounting for 36 per cent of Bihar’s population, and have been a crucial support base for the NDA, especially for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor women, the manifesto pledged Rs 200,000 to women entrepreneurs, in addition to Rs 10,000 already deposited in the accounts of 11 million women in the state.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rival INDIA bloc targets youth with job guarantees</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led INDIA bloc has promised to create at least 15 million jobs and one government job for each household in the state. There are an estimated 27.6 million households in Bihar, according to its 2023 caste survey.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Farmers and poor among key beneficiaries</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor farmers, the NDA manifesto proposed a Rs 4,500 per annum “top up” for aquaculture farmers over and above the Rs 4,500 provided by the Centre, and announced plans to set up a “Bihar milk mission.” For the poor, it promised 125 units of free power, free medical treatment worth up to Rs 500,000, and 5 million pucca houses.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Infrastructure, education, and industry in focus</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOther promises include metro train services in four cities; international airports in Darbhanga, Purnia and Bhagalpur; seven expressways; an expanded rail network; 10 industrial parks; and free quality education from kindergarten to post-graduation for students from poor families. The manifesto also promised Rs 2,000 monthly assistance for Scheduled Caste students pursuing higher education, transforming large schools in districts with a total allocation of Rs 5,000 crore, and establishing a defence corridor and semiconductor manufacturing parks.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe NDA also pledged to rename ‘Punaura Dham Janki Mandir,’ a Hindu pilgrimage site in Sitamarhi district believed to be the birthplace of Goddess Sita, as ‘Sitapuram.’</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Top leaders present at Patna release event</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe manifesto was released at a press conference attended by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, BJP president J P Nadda, Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Jitan Ram Manjhi, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan, and leaders of alliance partners.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Congress questions Nitish’s silence at release even</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTalking to reporters in Patna, senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot claimed that the NDA’s manifesto release event lasted only “26 seconds,” as leaders were reluctant to take questions from journalists on their 20-year rule. Gehlot said Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was “not allowed” to speak at the release, and wondered whether he was “not in a position” to do so. Congress Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh called it an insult to Bihar and Biharis that Kumar was not permitted to speak.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

In the first tranche, GCPL will make a payment of ₹289 crore for an enterprise value of ₹380 crore, and the second tranche will be paid 12 months later for approximately ₹160 crore at an enterprise value of ₹400–500 crore, the company said in its stock exchange filing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This brand is one of India’s fastest-growing men’s grooming brands, with a strong leadership position in the men’s facewash segment. This acquisition marks a strategic step in GCPL’s journey to strengthen its personal care portfolio and expand its footprint in high-growth, high-margin categories,” it said in its release.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Muuchstac brand is currently among the top two players in the men’s online facewash category and holds the top-three spot overall. In the 12 months ending September 2025, the business recorded revenues of approximately ₹80 crore and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) — adjusted for one-offs — of around ₹30 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Indian facewash market, estimated at ₹6,000–7,000 crore, is growing at 15–20 per cent per annum, driven by rising awareness of skincare and an ongoing shift from soaps to more specialised cleansing formats.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/swan-eyes-875-crore-govt-assistance-for-pipavav-shipyard-expansion-125103101243_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Swan eyes ₹875 crore govt assistance for Pipavav Shipyard expansion</a></strong></div></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Within this, the men’s facewash category, valued at about ₹1,000 crore, is growing at over 25 per cent annually, making it one of the fastest-growing segments in personal care. The upgradation trend from soaps to facewash, supported by higher disposable incomes and changing grooming preferences, is expected to sustain strong momentum in the coming years,” the release added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are delighted to welcome the Muuchstac brand to Godrej Consumer Products. The brand’s strong resonance among younger consumers, high profitability, and proven digital execution model make it a powerful addition to our personal care portfolio. This acquisition enhances our participation in the fast-growing men’s grooming segment and supports our vision of building a future-ready, innovation-led GCPL,” said Sudhir Sitapati, managing director and chief executive officer at GCPL, in the release.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonak Bagadia and Vishal Lohia, founders of Muuchstac, said they look forward to the business scaling up in line with their vision of redefining men’s skincare in India and added that they will work closely with the team at Godrej for the same.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the July–September quarter, GCPL’s consolidated net profit fell 6.5 per cent to ₹459.3 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts net sales grew 4.3 per cent to ₹3,825.1 crore. It reported a volume growth of 3 per cent in the domestic business during the quarter under review.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 5.8 per cent in the quarter ended September to ₹796.2 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCommenting on its results, Sitapati said, “Q2 FY26 has been a resilient quarter for Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), especially given the backdrop of the GST transition in India and continued macroeconomic challenges in Indonesia. Despite these headwinds, our India business, excluding soaps, has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth, reflecting the strength of our core portfolio and execution.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said that the recent GST rate reduction is a welcome structural reform that will strengthen long-term consumer demand.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs warned by the company ahead of its earnings, Sitapati said in the release, “However, this transition led to short-term trade disruptions as the channel adjusted to new pricing and cleared old inventory, particularly impacting soaps and hair colour. Despite this, we continue to gain market share in soaps and other key categories.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that in October, the company entered the ₹3,000-crore toilet cleaner category, which is growing at strong double digits.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our new brand, Godrej Spic, has been launched in select South Indian states, priced competitively at ₹79 for 500 ml, marking an important step in expanding our home care portfolio,” he said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tArtificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks have more room to grow, said Mark Matthews, managing director and head of research for Asia at Julius Baer at a lunch organised by Business Standard on the sideline of Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe described the current market sentiment related to AI stocks as “crazy,” amid the hype surrounding tech leaders such as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There are definitely AI rockstars. Jensen Huang is number one, and Sam Altman is another. Others like Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos now look like legacy figures,” he said. “Historically, every big technological transition — whether it was oil or finance — had towering figures like Rockefeller or JP Morgan. So this isn’t new.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile acknowledging that the euphoria feels “frothy,” Matthews does not believe the AI phase signals an imminent correction. “When you combine these flamboyant personalities with extreme bullishness, it does feel overheated. That said, I think the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq could still rise 15–20 per cent over the next 12 months.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCountering this view, Shankar Sharma, founder GQuant FinXRay noted that the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have done well only in dollar terms. “In euro terms, they’re lagging badly this year,” he said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Focus on China</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven as China’s economy has grown rapidly over the years, its muted stock market returns emerged as a key point of discussion. Since 2020, China’s CSI 300 index has gained nearly 13 per cent, even as the country’s economy has expanded multifold, Matthews said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMatthews also showed a slide depicting Tencent’s headquarters with a statue reading 'Join our party, start your business', a symbol of the state’s deep control over private enterprise.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith the state’s growing presence in India as well, Matthews cautioned that the single biggest risk for the country lies in rising inequality -- between rich and poor, and between old and young.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“When young people can’t find good jobs, societies tend to adopt more socialist policies, which usually don’t yield strong stock market returns,” he said. “China somehow built a prosperous economy despite poor market returns by distributing wealth. The danger is that other nations might try to copy China’s state-heavy model without understanding how it really worked.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Shankar Sharma offered a contrasting perspective. He argued that China had deliberately suppressed its stock market to channel talent into areas of real innovation, research and development (R&amp;D), manufacturing, and engineering, rather than into gaming or delivery apps.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This system is hard to replicate elsewhere,” Sharma said. “India, for instance, is already too financialised — too many engineers are building apps for food delivery instead of hard tech. It’s too late to reverse that model now.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Nationalism and deglobalisation</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAsked whether the rise of nationalism in major economies such as the US and China was hurting global growth, Matthews said the impact so far has been less severe than expected.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Superficially, it looks like it should be very bad, because we were all taught that globalization is good, that it creates activity and encourages the free flow of people and capital. A reversal should be bad, but somehow that’s not showing up in the numbers,\" he said. He added that the modern economy’s shift toward services may be cushioning the blow.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe country’s broking industry is in a “healthy pause” phase, a period of recalibration after the post-pandemic boom. Captains of the broking and wealth management industry believe market nervousness and tighter regulation in the derivatives segment have contributed to the slowdown, which is both expected and necessary.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking at the <em>Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025</em> in Mumbai, Shripal Shah, MD &amp; CEO, Kotak Securities; Pranav Haridasan, MD &amp; CEO, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/axis-securities\" target=\"_blank\">Axis Securities</a>; Amisha Vora, chairperson and MD, PL Capital Group; and Ajay Menon, MD &amp; CEO - Retail Wealth, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, shared their insights on how the industry is evolving amid regulatory changes, rising compliance costs and an increasingly informed investor base.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCooling-off after record growth</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tFollowing an unprecedented surge during and after the pandemic, the broking industry has seen trading volumes and account openings moderate over the past year. “This pause is going to turn into a reboot mode,” said Shripal Shah of Kotak Securities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile derivative orders have dropped about 30 per cent from last year, he said the reset will prepare the industry for deeper market participation. “About 63 per cent of Indian households are aware of the capital market, but only 9.5 per cent participate. The next phase of growth lies in bridging that gap,” Shah said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tLong road to market penetration</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India’s equity participation continues to trail global peers, Pranav Haridasan of Axis Securities points out that market maturity evolves alongside rising income levels. “In the US, 55–60 per cent of people invest in equities, while China is around 18–20 per cent. India will see participation rise as per capita GDP improves,” he said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also cautioned that the journey ahead will be gradual. “Unlike the Covid-era spurt, this will be a secular, steady journey,” he said. The industry is now focusing on sustainable account growth and the right customer targeting, enabled by data and technology.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaridasan emphasised that awareness alone isn’t enough and education must accompany access. “There is a real need in financial services to teach the basics of investing really well,” Haridasan added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCompliance, cost and youth factor</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRising compliance and cybersecurity spending continue to shape the industry’s cost structure. Compliance costs have gone up by the day, from cyber safeguards to account opening norms. But this discipline will strengthen the ecosystem, opines Amisha Vora of PL Capital Group.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVora also noted how new investors are reshaping market dynamics. “Over 50 per cent of new accounts in the industry were opened in North and East India. less than 50 per cent of new accounts were opened in the western and southern regions, which are considered more financially literate,” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd, the young demographic will be central to long-term market growth in India. “More than half of new investors are below 30 years of age, their continued participation, directly or through mutual funds, is a structural positive,” she said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tFrom short-term gains to long-term vision</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile digital access has democratised investing, the challenge lies in converting new traders into disciplined, long-term investors. Ajay Menon of Motilal Oswal Financial Services pointed out that retail investors are maturing fast. “Investors are smart. They know that consistently putting money into the market will give them long-term growth in their overall investment journey,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDiversification remains key to wealth creation, with a focus on spreading investments across mutual fund SIPs, insurance, and alternate assets to strengthen clients’ long-term wealth journeys, Menon said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also underscored the importance of systematic investing, “From a retail investor’s perspective, there needs to be some amount of investment into mutual fund SIPs, since it gives you a sustained growth journey.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tDigital push for the sector</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile discount brokers have transformed the landscape, full-service players are keeping pace through digital innovation and advisory depth. “Today, a full-service broker can offer a digital platform as advanced as any discount player, with the added advantage of research and education,” said Shripal Shah of Kotak Securities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that industry consolidation will be driven less by regulation and more by the need for technology investment and resilience, Shah said. The panellists at the BS BFSI Insight Summit agreed that as AI-driven advisory, financial education and responsible leverage take root, India’s broking industry will emerge stronger.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tConsolidation and the road ahead</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tLooking ahead, the industry leaders agreed that consolidation is inevitable as compliance, technology and cybersecurity requirements demand scale. “Smaller players may merge or exit, but innovation will continue,” Shah said. “There’s still a lot of potential in AI-led advisory and automation.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaridasan emphasised that the industry’s fundamentals remain strong. The broking industry has taken a pause, but it’s rebooting. With AI, data analytics and rising financial literacy, the next phase will be more efficient, inclusive and resilient, he shared. </div></div>",

            "id": 125103101250,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWith Indian markets yet to hit new highs in 2025, <strong>Mark Matthews</strong>, managing director and head of research for Asia at Julius Baer, tells <em>Puneet Wadhwa</em> in a fireside chat that India is the only essential emerging market for global portfolios. India’s two big strengths, he believes, are its demographics and 'Jugaad' – the ‘can-do’ spirit. Edited excerpts:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you assess the year 2025 for global financial markets, excluding India?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn one word, surprising. Truth be told, if you had asked me in January 2025 how global markets would perform this year, I would have said there was over a 50 per cent chance they would be down. Yet here we are, with the bellwether equity index, the S&amp;P 500, up 17 per cent, much better than the long-term average. It has been a surprising year. What’s even more incredible is that emerging markets (EM) as a whole are up over 30 per cent. So yes, it’s been a really surprising year, and that makes me somewhat uncomfortable forecasting the next one.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The US markets have made consistent highs throughout 2025, whereas the Indian markets have done so just once at the benchmark level. Would you say the Indian markets have decoupled from the US?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo. The Nifty is up about 6 to 7 per cent in US dollar terms. That’s a perfectly good return — annualised, it's around 11 to 12 per cent. So, it’s not that India has gone down, but it has underperformed the US and its emerging market peers. There are two main reasons for this. First, China. A year ago, Indian fund managers feared that China would become investable again, and it has. Second, corporate earnings in India have disappointed, but are nearing an inflection point. With goods and services tax (GST) cuts kicking in late September, along with monetary easing, income tax cuts, and a favourable base, fiscal year 2027 could see double-digit earnings growth. In the September quarter results, the number of misses are half what it was in the previous two quarters. Nearly 20 per cent of the companies that reported results have missed, as compared to about 40 per cent for the previous two quarters.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Were Indian markets boring in 2025 as risk reward seemed favourable elsewhere; disappointing in terms of returns; or challenging in terms of lack of investment opportunities?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI would describe India as a rather boring market this year. To be honest, I’ve been catching up on developments in China, which has made a big comeback. China’s progress across several high-technology sectors has been remarkable.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the US market nearing a bubble, especially given the performance of the 'Magnificent 7' technology stocks?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tYou could define a bubble either by valuations or by technicals. Surprisingly, by neither measure is the US market in a bubble yet.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Nasdaq-100 has not deviated significantly from its long-term trend, unlike the dot-com bubble of 1998–1999, which was about three standard deviations above the average. Currently, it’s less than one standard deviation above trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs for valuations, the forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of the Magnificent 7 is about 33 times for the next 12 months and around 23 times for the next 24 months. In contrast, during the 1990s bubble, major tech stocks were trading at about 50 times PE. So, the US market is not yet in bubble territory.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the lack of AI investment by Indian IT companies a concern?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo, quite the contrary. The danger lies in the scale of artificial intelligence (AI) spending by hyperscalers. This year alone, the big five are investing $375 billion, and over the next three years, about $1.1 trillion, more than the size of the German stock market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe risk is that these companies may not earn adequate returns. AI will benefit the broader economy through productivity and efficiency gains, but the companies making massive upfront investments bear the real risk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What returns do you expect from Indian equities over the next year?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOver the long-term, I believe small and mid-caps will outperform simply because they have more room to grow. For the next 12 months, I expect returns of around 15 per cent, driven by expected earnings growth of about 16-18 per cent for the Nifty in fiscal year 2027. The market isn’t expensive relative to peers, and as earnings momentum picks up, there is room for re-rating.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What could drive Indian markets over the next three to five years?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia’s two big strengths are its demographics and its 'Jugaad' – the ‘can-do’ spirit. India has more people entering the prime earning age (30–60 years) than any other country, and this advantage should last until around 2060. The second factor, Jugaad, reflects India’s positive, problem-solving attitude, which is often lacking elsewhere.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What’s your view on gold and silver?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tGold, historically, has returned about 5 per cent per year in dollars and serves as a hedge against inflation. Recent price increases are not unusual, they’re partly due to geopolitical tensions and the confiscation of Russian assets, which has undermined trust in Western financial systems.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI expect gold to correct modestly to around $3,500 per ounce before rising to $4,500 within a year. Some optimistic projections even see it reaching $6,600 eventually, and yes, I think that’s possible.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>For investors looking to enter India now, is this the right time, or should they look elsewhere?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia is fairly priced. Earnings growth looks solid for next year. India is the only essential emerging market for global portfolios — you don’t need Brazil, Indonesia, or Turkey, but you do need India, which has consistently delivered strong returns and should continue to do so.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
