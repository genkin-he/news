This reflects a pickup in credit demand from Indian corporates — a trend evident in Q2 FY26, during which major banks reported stronger growth in their corporate loan portfolios.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, credit growth to industries during this period remained lower than the same time last year, when it had expanded by nearly 9 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Retail credit growth moderates year-on-year</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, retail credit continued to moderate, growing 11.7 per cent during the period ended September 19, compared with 13.4 per cent a year earlier. The slowdown was mainly due to weaker growth in vehicle loans and credit card outstandings.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) sectoral deployment of credit data, within industries, credit to ‘micro and small’ and ‘medium’ industries continued to grow in double digits.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Among major industries, outstanding credit to ‘all engineering’, ‘infrastructure’, ‘textiles’, and ‘vehicles, vehicle parts and transport equipment’ recorded buoyant year-on-year growth,” the RBI said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Services sector and agriculture credit see slower expansion</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring this period, non-food bank credit grew by 10.2 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y), compared with 13 per cent a year ago.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCredit to the services sector registered a growth rate of 10.2 per cent Y-o-Y, compared with 13.7 per cent in the same period last year, mainly because credit to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) grew 4 per cent Y-o-Y, compared with nearly 10 per cent earlier. Segments such as ‘tourism, hotels and restaurants’, ‘computer software’, and ‘commercial real estate’ witnessed robust growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, credit to agriculture and allied activities registered 9 per cent Y-o-Y growth, compared with 16.4 per cent in the year-ago period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
