We cannot comment on a breakup by geography or business or levels. We cannot comment on the specifics of our severance package but are committed to supporting our team members throughout the process. We can confirm that our separation package is over and above legal requirements.\"</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe layoffs come even as Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is also looking to reduce its headcount in India by 1,000-1,500. Those layoffs impacted multiple business units including AWS, Prime Video teams and retail business unit.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTarget, which opened one of the first GCCs in India, more than two decades ago, will also close 800 open positions globally. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCompanies globally, and especially in the US, are trying to reduce staff cost by citing a sluggish macroeconomic environment, high tariffs, impact of automation, and shifting consumer habits. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRetail GCCs were among the first to flourish in India and Bengaluru is the home to a host of such centres. Rarely anywhere in the world would one come across a place where companies like Walmart, Lowe’s, JCPenney, Hudson Bay, L Brands, Ikea, Falabella, Tesco, and Albertsons most of which have no stores in India, are all developing new technology to make the shopping experience more pleasant for its customers.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSuch capability centres now have product ownership, drive core business functions and outcomes, and also build new capabilities to make their parent a future-ready enterprise.

There are more and more instances globally in the last two or three months, where non-customer-centric businesses have been hacked.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about customer awareness, Mahavir Jindal, chief operating officer (COO), Amazon Pay India, said it is not easy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that educating customers is going to be a long journey. “It is a journey that we need to start now. We are still at the base layer, where we are still talking about phishing and how to safeguard against this.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMalcolm Gomes, COO at IDfy, also said that there is still a highly vulnerable population which includes the elderly and some who don’t understand mainstream languages.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The basics have been done, but there is a lot more that needs to be done through video and Whatsapp channels. Everyone is doing their fair share. The RBI does, banks do. I still feel it has not got to perhaps the most vulnerable sections of society. That is also where a lot of the source problems are,” Gomes said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAll the three experts also agreed on the urgent need for a zero-trust approach — a model now seen as essential for securing digital ecosystems as regulators demand greater operational transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA zero-trust model treats every user and device as untrusted, requiring continuous verification before granting access to systems or data.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGomes said that zero trust has existed for a while, “It started with the NIST in the US, and the thought process came from there. At this point, regulators have not mandated it, but it has crept into the thought process of organisations.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said it doesn’t help that AI tools are getting much more sophisticated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJindal, too, said, “If someone is in a financial services business, he has to operate in a zero-trust environment,” adding that for him, zero trust is “all-pervasive.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about the threat vectors, which are evolving rapidly, he said zero-trust capabilities must advance in tandem.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that at Amazon Pay, “any data exchange, whether with an external partner or an internal one, happens in a zero-trust environment — implying an exchange of keys.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he believes the industry is doing a decent job implementing zero-trust systems, Jindal warned that the pace of cyber threats continues to accelerate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“While we have a good foundation, there is a long way to go to address the emerging threat vectors,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about cyber security becoming a priority for organisations, Mukherjee said, “For any organisation, there are multiple competing priorities. Needless to say that cyber for most organisations is among the top.”</div></div>",

They submitted end-user certificates required under Beijing’s export control regime, ensuring the materials will not be diverted to the United States (US) or used for defence production.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn his media briefing, Jaiswal also noted that the US has granted India a six-month waiver, effective October 29, from sanctions on the Chabahar port project in Iran, where India has played a central role in development.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn trade negotiations, he said New Delhi remains “engaged with the US on finalising the trade deal”. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met earlier this week on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur, where discussions are believed to have touched on the pending trade deal. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tJaiswal also told reporters India is assessing how Thursday's understanding between Washington and Beijing on rare earths might affect its own interests. These comments came hours after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, where Beijing agreed to delay by a year the introduction of its latest round of rare earth export restrictions, originally slated to take effect on November 8.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe four aforementioned firms granted import licences are key suppliers to the Indian automobile industry, which has been hit hard by China’s curbs on exports of rare earth materials -- essential components in electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, aircraft and weapons systems.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tNew Delhi had raised the issue during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to India in August, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Xi in Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit. China had then promised to resume exports of rare earths and fertilisers, later seeking end-use certification from Indian buyers.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tJaiswal said the government is also examining the implications of recent US sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft. “Our decisions naturally take into account the evolving dynamics of the global market,” he said, adding that India’s energy policy is driven by the need to “secure affordable energy from diverse sources to meet the energy security needs of our 1.4 billion people.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn a related comment, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that India had been “very good” on reducing oil imports from Russia, while noting that China continues to purchase large volumes. Trump said Xi has been “buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China. And, you know, I can say India's been very good on that front.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn the Chabahar port waiver, Jaiswal confirmed that India’s exemption from US sanctions will run for six months. The US had earlier indicated that activities linked to the Iranian port could attract penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act, revoking a waiver granted in 2018. Chabahar forms a key node in the International North–South Transport Corridor connecting India with Central Asia and Europe.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tWith the Quad Summit unlikely to be held this year, Jaiswal said the grouping -- comprising India, Japan, the US, and Australia -- “remains a valuable forum for discussions on shared interests,” adding that any leaders’ summit is arranged “through diplomatic consultations among the four partners.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAmid renewed tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the MEA reiterated India’s support for Kabul. “Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories,” Jaiswal said. “It seems to think it has the right to practise cross-border terrorism with impunity. Its neighbours find it unacceptable. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
