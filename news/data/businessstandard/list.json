There is no problem of capital availability. Both banks and corporates are doing very well, their balance sheets are in good shape,” Dev said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe was delivering the inaugural Distinguished Person Lecture organised by the Institute for Studies in Industrial Development (ISID).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Viksit Bharat is not just about achieving growth.

Umang Vohra, MD and global chief executive officer (CEO) of Cipla said in the company’s earnings call, “The latest USFDA guidance is a significant positive for the industry as it sharply lowers development costs and accelerates timelines for biosimilars. Companies will no longer need to invest $40–90 million to secure an approvable package. This substantially reduces the burden of proving similarity.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis shift is likely to attract more players, spur investments, and fast-track market entry.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We will likely see an explosion in the number of players targeting biosimilars. Cipla operates in several categories that require $15–20 million in spending, which, while lower than biosimilars, still poses a high entry barrier. So, I don’t think this move will lead to the same level of competition as seen in the chemical side of the business,” Vohra said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe biosimilar market remains compelling with individual product opportunities still valued at $3–5 billion.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith the regulatory environment becoming more supportive, India has a strong opportunity to broaden participation in biosimilars, much like it did in small-molecule generics, pharma industry executives felt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe draft guidance removes the need for most comparative efficacy trials — the most expensive and time-consuming part of biosimilar development. Instead, it permits companies to rely on advanced analytical and functional studies to establish similarity with reference biologics.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also aims to simplify the pathway for granting “interchangeability” with original biologics, allowing pharmacists and patients to more easily opt for lower-cost substitutes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe USFDA has issued draft guidance aimed at streamlining the regulatory pathway for biosimilars, marking a potential shift in how these products are evaluated and approved.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/industry/news/godrej-consumer-products-signs-pact-to-acquire-muuchstac-in-all-cash-deal-125103101323_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Godrej Consumer Products signs pact to acquire Muuchstac in all-cash deal</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe draft recommends that a comparative analytical assessment (CAA), supported by human pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity data, will often be sufficient to demonstrate similarity with the reference biologic.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis approach seeks to eliminate routine comparative efficacy studies (CES) — the most time-consuming and expensive component of biosimilar development. But the CES may still be required for select products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSponsors will be responsible for determining the appropriate study design and are encouraged to discuss their plans with the agency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts estimate that if finalised, the new framework could significantly reduce trial requirements, compress development timelines from the current 8–9 years, and materially lower overall costs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama analysts felt the proposed model is expected to intensify competition and broaden participation in the US biosimilar market, where US and European companies currently dominate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndian manufacturers — benefiting from lower operating costs — stand to gain meaningfully as the market opens up.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to IQVIA, 118 biologics are set to lose patent protection between 2025 and 2034, representing a $232-billion opportunity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKey beneficiaries over the long term include Biocon, DRL, Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin, with Biocon particularly well-positioned due to its fully integrated biosimilar capabilities, they felt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe draft guidance will remain under discussion for the next few months.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary general Sudarshan Jain said the simplification of interchangeability guidelines and approval pathways will create a more enabling environment for the industry to diversify into the large-molecule space.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India already has nearly 130 approved biosimilars, and over the next seven years, more than 55 blockbuster drugs are expected to lose exclusivity in the US. India has long been a trusted partner in ensuring access to quality-assured, affordable medicines for American patients. These reforms will further strengthen the US–India partnership and our shared goal of improving healthcare access and affordability,” Jain added. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US biologics market is estimated to be around $100 billion, and the USFDA’s initiative is expected to encourage more Indian pharma players to tap it.</div></div>",
