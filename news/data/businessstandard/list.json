In a conversation with <strong>Nivedita Mookerji</strong> at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Summit 2025, she warns that no organisation can survive without a robust information-technology (IT) backbone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you look at the world of technology after coming from SBI, and it has been five years at Salesforce now?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven at the bank, I strongly believed that any organisation not taking IT seriously will not sustain itself. Whether you’re a small family-run shop or in HR, logistics, manufacturing, or services — a strong IT backbone is essential. Technology is evolving at an unprecedented speed. We are now working with Agentic AI, and in just 13 months we have covered enormous ground, enabling Agentic enterprises. The pace of change is extraordinary, even within tech.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>From the world of SBI to this speed of technology, how has the transition been?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSBI teaches you to lead while learning. Because you’re transferred often — to different locations and across verticals and teams — you learn on your feet. I used to say that once I found a good hairdresser and tailor for my saree blouses, it was time to be transferred! This environment prepares you to add value immediately, which helped me in transitioning from 40 years in banking to working with people five generations younger.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>If you were to describe your journey as a woman leader, how would you put it?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI never thought of it in a precise way. For a woman in India with a career, it’s a constant calibration between family responsibilities and work. There are moments when you wonder if it’s worth it, but you must accept the reality and still move forward. Many women ask if I faced difficulty getting junior male colleagues to listen. I didn’t. Either I was lucky or any comments never reached me. I think what worked was my ability to communicate in a way that excited them as much as it did me. When people are convinced and energised, the gender of the leader doesn’t matter.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you share a few things you did for your women colleagues, apart from allowing sabbaticals?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe sabbatical was one, and I hoped other public-sector banks would follow, though they haven’t yet. I still hope they do, because it’s very helpful. I noticed many women were in platform roles, not in branch operations like their male colleagues. To qualify for the next promotion, they needed two years in an independent role and two years in rural service. Yet, in rural areas, landlords wouldn’t rent premises to single women. So, we identified rural branches women could commute to, or we rented accommodation in the bank’s name with multiple rooms for women branch managers. Many opted for these roles, and some told me those shared years were the best of their lives.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe also implemented cervical-cancer vaccination for all women staffers and their wards. And I tried to ensure that in major centres, we had at least one lady doctor — a gynaecologist or paediatrician — so women didn’t have to spend time outside arranging appointments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>There was a time when we had many woman CEOs across banks. Not any longer. What happened?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen I left, I left behind a strong pipeline of women, many of whom have achieved a lot. My former chief financial officer (CFO) is now CFO of the World Bank. Another headed Indian Bank and later NSDL. Women who were deputy managing director then have gone on to lead in several places. The glass ceiling still exists and takes time and effort to break. We were fortunate to have a strong cohort across PSBs, private and foreign banks. I recall a reception hosted by Raghuram Rajan (who was Reserve Bank of India governor from 2013 to 2016) — there were more sarees than suits in the room!</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>As a banker earlier, how do you look at the banking universe today from the outside?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator plays a significant role. The sector’s challenges today are different. One of the biggest now is technology — how banks use it to deliver better services, and how they reconcile the fact that work done by people can now be done by digital agents that can think, generate, and act. Banks must leverage tech to reach the last mile — to 600,000 villages where financial literacy is still lacking but crucial for unlocking India’s potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBFSI is the most digitally mature sector, so it must absorb new technology and use it daily to deliver the best to customers and show the way for other industries.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>During your SBI tenure, you took steps to bring in technology. SBI was called a “Smart Bank”. Looking back, could you have done more?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe did what we could at that time. Many things available today weren’t available then. When YONO launched, it was far ahead of private or foreign banks. The risk-management techniques we put in place, tech for credit underwriting, reaching the right customers through inclusion efforts, and the range of products — we pushed the envelope. With hindsight, perhaps we could have focused more on agility. You can’t be agile and nimble when you are working with systems that are very stodgy and are rooted in the past, which are a lot of legacy. You can’t write off all technical debt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Other than technology, was there any other unfinished business?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCustomer service will always remain a work in progress because expectations keep rising. Take technology: Customers want safety, but if we add multiple login layers, they complain; if login is easier, they worry about risk. We could have done better with customer literacy — explaining safety measures while retaining convenience. Every stakeholder, including the regulator, has a role.</div></div>",

Just as mutual funds and insurance became household names, alternatives are following suit.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Jain, the next phase of growth will hinge on domestic capital pools connecting India’s deep savings ecosystem with private equity and venture capital. “Every large economy eventually funds itself domestically. India is reaching that stage,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tMarket-beating returns</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra, partner at Samara Capital, highlighted that private equity has consistently outperformed public markets globally, and India’s story mirrors that trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Globally, PE has outperformed public markets by about 6–7 per cent on a 10-year rolling basis,” he said. “In India, deal flow has picked up sharply. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices are increasing allocations to alternative funds — from 7–8 per cent now to a projected 15–16 per cent.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe identified three pillars driving mainstreaming: fundraising, deal flow, and exits. “We now have vibrant opportunities in growth capital, buyouts, and even secondary exits. IPOs, domestic M&amp;As, SME listings — all of these complete a healthy investment cycle,” Kabra added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExits and buyouts mark a new phase</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKedaara Capital’s founder and managing partner Kejriwal said India’s “sweet spot” stems from improved exit markets and a cultural shift among family-owned businesses. “Fifteen years ago, India was good at attracting capital but not returning it,” he said. “That’s changed. We’ve had robust IPOs, sponsor-to-sponsor sales, and rising acceptance among business families to sell strategic stakes. Selling is no longer seen as a mark of shame,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuyouts, once rare, now account for half of all private equity deals, noted Gopalakrishnan. “In 2013, buyouts made up just 20 per cent of the market. With succession planning more common and the economy larger, both the pool of opportunities and transaction sizes have risen.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s scale advantage</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India becomes the world’s fifth-largest economy, global investors are paying closer attention. “Private equity works in large and sophisticated economies,” said Gaja Capital’s Jain. “Until recently, India was neither large nor sophisticated enough. That’s changed. We now have the scale, entrepreneurs, and IPO markets to support sustained private equity growth.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKejriwal added that while India remains an “entrepreneurial country of immense depth”, the PE industry is still at the level of a cottage industry. “We’ve barely scratched the surface. The best years are yet to come,” he predicted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI and the next investment wave</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn whether artificial intelligence (AI) will reshape investment patterns, Kejriwal struck a cautious tone: “We’re not chasing the AI hype. For us, the focus is on how our portfolio companies adopt AI efficiently, rather than betting on untested products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra echoed the sentiment, saying India’s role in AI will be more about building supportive infrastructure than developing frontier models. “We’re investing in the ecosystem — from data structuring to chip manufacturing — to future-proof our portfolios,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is a constant game of adapting. Our job is to future-proof the businesses we invest in,” said Gopalakrishnan.</div></div>",

The development led to a drop of more than 4 per cent in the company’s share price.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Considering this is a major near-term product opportunity for the company, we expect near-term volatility in the share price,” an analysis by Nuvama stated.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to analysts, the development could delay the launch of DRL’s new semaglutide injection by at least eight to twelve months.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Though we were always cautious on this opportunity, a negative review by Health Canada reflects the worst case,” a report by market analyst Citigroup stated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Patent expiry and market opportunity for generics</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSemaglutide is the active ingredient in the popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, manufactured by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeveral drugmakers have been targeting the production of a generic version of semaglutide, as Novo’s patent on it is set to expire in several markets starting next year. Among them, the Canadian market is expected to be the first to see semaglutide lose exclusivity, with patent expiry due in January 2026.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts said Canada appears cautious about approving generic versions of semaglutide since it is a mass-market product without any approved generic from a developed-market regulator, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Due to this, we think Health Canada is cautious before it approves the first semaglutide generic. DRL has a first-to-file (FTF) for this product in Canada and this seems to be its third review,” Nuvama noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that analysts have observed a few complex products getting approved after two review cycles. “Therefore, we are still building the product approval near the patent expiry,” Nuvama said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Analysts weigh impact on DRL’s earnings outlook</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, a report from Morgan Stanley said that success in Canada for generic semaglutide is a key driver for the firm’s FY27 earnings, with timely approval and launch crucial to staying on track.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Bank of America (BofA) stated that while the semaglutide approval may have been pushed out, it still expects the drug to be launched in the first half of FY27 (H1FY27) rather than being a lost opportunity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Dr Reddy has a filing in 87 countries and indicated confidence to sell all 12 million pens in FY27 even if Canada approval is delayed. This could offset the impact from the delay,” BofA added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>DRL confident in product quality and compliance</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn its part, DRL stated that it would submit a response to the NoN promptly and within the stipulated time frame.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We remain confident in the quality, safety and comparability of our proposed product and remain committed to making this important therapy available to patients in Canada and other markets at the earliest,” the company said in its regulatory filing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn Thursday, DRL’s shares dropped by 3.94 per cent, closing the day at ₹1,203.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</div></div>",
