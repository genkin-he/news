            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to make India’s tax system more trust-based, simpler, and technology-driven in the Union Budget 2026-27, with a focus on faster dispute resolution and easier Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rules. “India’s next leap requires a principle-based, technology-enabled, and trust-anchored tax system,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said after the industry body met the revenue secretary on Friday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCII noted that tax litigation continues to burden businesses, with more than five lakh appeals involving nearly ₹18 lakh crore pending before the commissioner (appeals). It asked the government to fast-track cases involving more than ₹100 crore and resolve them within one year through virtual hearings and close monitoring by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Penalty proceedings should be paused till the main appeal is settled, and draft orders should be shared for factual checks before being finalised, it suggested. CII also sought revival of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) under retired high court judges, “empowered to deliver binding rulings within six months”.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build taxpayer confidence, CII called for converting the existing taxpayer charter into a legal Taxpayer Rights Charter guaranteeing time-bound refunds, faceless assessments, and accountability for administrative delays. It also flagged issues in the Central Processing Centre (CPC) system for return processing and asked for “improved protocols ensuring that only apparent mistakes are adjusted automatically and that taxpayers can request virtual hearings when required”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn direct tax simplification, CII said the TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework — with more than 35 categories and multiple rates — has become too complex and affects business liquidity. It recommended reducing the framework to two or three broad rates, exempting transactions between Goods and Services Tax (GST)-registered entities, and clarifying that no TDS should apply to the GST portion of a payment. “Tax simplification is not a concession; it is an investment in governance efficiency,” Banerjee said. “When rules are clear and systems are digital, compliance becomes automatic and disputes become exceptional.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn indirect taxes and customs, CII pitched a one-time settlement scheme for old disputes, longer validity for advance rulings, and full digital processing of customs through Application Programming Interface (API)-based systems. It suggested a roadmap for “paper-free customs by 2028” with e-refunds, e-adjudication, and e-appeals. CII also called for rationalising tariffs by consolidating exemption notifications and permitting a single appeal for multiple bills of entry (BoE) where issues are common, along with automatic release of bonds once export obligations are met.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo improve predictability, CII suggested a multi-year corporate tax roadmap and removal of prosecution for minor and unintentional errors under both direct and indirect tax laws. “CII’s proposals are not about cutting taxes, but they are about cutting friction,” Banerjee said, adding that a trust-based compliance system can boost revenues without hurting the exchequer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India has already shown the world that large-scale reforms like GST 2.0 can succeed,” he said. “If we now make our tax systems as simple and predictable as they are digital and fair, we will not only raise revenues more efficiently but also build the foundations of an economy that inspires confidence — both at home and abroad.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

His takeaway? That economic sanity lies not in extremes but in acknowledging trade-offs, that moderation itself is revolutionary in polarised times.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThen there’s <strong>Devangshu Datta’s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/grandmaster-danya-s-death-exposes-cyberbullying-threat-in-online-chess-125103101562_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">piece </a><a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/grandmaster-danya-s-death-exposes-cyberbullying-threat-in-online-chess-125103101562_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">on Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky</a>, whose brilliance on the chessboard was overshadowed by online torment. Accused without evidence, the 29-year-old champion’s tragic death has shaken the chess world and exposed how digital witch-hunts blur the line between vigilance and cruelty. The board, once a space of intellect and respect, now mirrors the chaos of comment threads.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar, alongside Uttar Pradesh, has long been a never-ending source of cheap labour for other Indian states, especially those that have industrial jobs to offer. Its politicians, on the other hand, have only been a source of empty promises of jobs that have rarely come to fruition, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/the-job-promises-bihar-continues-to-fuel-india-s-migrant-labour-force-125103101590_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">a chimera that has re-manifested itself ahead of the Assembly elections next week</a>, writes <strong>Mihir S Sharma</strong>. But with other states increasingly saying they would rather hire their own, out-migration from Bihar might slow down despite the government's failures in creating an employment-friendly ecosystem. The fantastical promises about job creation from all parties, however, proves one thing: the incumbent government has failed to do so in the past. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUS President Donald Trump earlier this week dropped a shockingly dangerous post, saying his country would resume nuclear testing. But it was likely a red herring, says <strong>Shekhar Gupta</strong>, <a href=\"https://mybs.in/2er11Wr?1761939146\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a show of braggadocio before he capitulated to China on trade</a>. The larger message, though, was that for all his leveraging America's buying power (read consumerism), China is the one with a hand on both sides of the trade scale - as buyer and seller. And this is where India has fallen woefully short with its miniscule trade numbers, thanks to a protectionist mindset, barely qualifying as a strategic weapon. Indeed, protectionism itself has become a strategic liability. This, he writes, could be India's second 1991 moment: reform by compulsion. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd finally, <strong>Kumar Abishek</strong> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/night-stolen-by-light-how-our-love-of-brightness-became-overexposure-125103101581_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">looks up, or rather, mourns that we no longer can</a>. Once, the Milky Way stretched over small-town rooftops like a promise. Today, it’s been erased by a sleepless orange haze. Light, once a symbol of hope, has turned into a pollutant, confusing birds, disorienting turtles, draining human health, and devouring $800 million a year in wasted energy. Abishek calls it “planetary insomnia,” cities too wired to rest, too proud of their glow to notice what they’ve lost. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStay tuned!</div></div>",
