At the heart of it stood Jemimah Rodrigues, who played the innings of her life — a breathtaking, unbeaten 127 off 134 balls that turned dreams into destiny on Thursday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen the pressure was at its peak and the shadows of Australia’s dominance loomed large, Rodrigues’ composure and poise stood out. Her masterful innings, supported by captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s authoritative 89 off 88 balls, ensured India not only chased down the mammoth target but did so with nine balls to spare.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/icc-women-s-world-cup-2025-final-schedule-teams-venue-live-streaming-125102901554_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">ICC Women's World Cup 2025 final schedule, teams, venue, live streaming</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis victory, soaked in emotion and redemption, will go down as one of the defining moments in Indian cricket’s history.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why this story matters</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHistoric chase: India’s successful pursuit of 339 is the highest-ever chase in women’s One-Day Internationals, rewriting the record books.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBreaking the Australian jinx: After years of heartbreak at the hands of Australia, India finally flipped the script — and in the grandest of settings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRise of a new generation: Rodrigues’ maturity and confidence symbolise a fearless new era for Indian women’s cricket.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInspiration beyond sport: The win reflects the growing strength, resilience, and ambition of India’s women athletes, resonating far beyond the boundary lines.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Australia’s power start, India’s stronger response</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier, Phoebe Litchfield’s commanding 119 off 93 balls, Ellyse Perry’s steady 77, and Ashleigh Gardner’s explosive 65 powered Australia to an imposing 338. It was a daunting total, built on dominance — but India had other plans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite losing Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana early, Rodrigues and Harmanpreet steadied the innings with a match-defining partnership. The duo’s calculated aggression and calm under pressure sapped the Australian bowlers’ confidence. Even as Kim Garth (2/46) and Annabel Sutherland (2/69) tried to claw back momentum, the pair refused to yield.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs the run rate climbed, Rodrigues shifted gears effortlessly, finding gaps and boundaries with surgical precision. Deepti Sharma (24) and Richa Ghosh (26) added crucial support in the chase, ensuring India stayed on course.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The winning moment</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen Amanjot Kaur pierced the field with the winning shot, the floodgates of emotion burst open. Jemimah sprinted towards her partner, arms wide, eyes glistening — and soon, the entire Indian team enveloped them in a jubilant embrace. Smriti Mandhana reached them first, laughter and tears blending in a moment that captured what years of toil and heartbreak had built toward.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe stands erupted.

For years, Australia had been the immovable mountain. Tonight, that mountain moved.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRodrigues’ innings will be remembered alongside the greats — not just for its beauty and precision, but for its context. This was her first ODI World Cup, and she carried India to their first-ever World Cup final berth with an innings of rare grace and grit.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHarmanpreet’s leadership, calm and commanding, underpinned a side that no longer plays with fear or deference. The young guns — Charani, Ghosh, Deepti — all played their parts in a team that now exudes belief.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis match may well be remembered as the turning point — when Indian women’s cricket stopped chasing dreams and began living them.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Brief Scores</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAustralia: 338 in 50 overs (Phoebe Litchfield 119, Ellyse Perry 77, Ashleigh Gardner 65; Deepti Sharma 2/73, Shree Charani 2/49).</div>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia: 341/5 in 48.3 overs (Jemimah Rodrigues 127 not out, Harmanpreet Kaur 89; Kim Garth 2/46).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The road ahead</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia now face South Africa in the final — a clash that could deliver the country’s first Women’s World Cup crown. But even before the final ball is bowled, this semifinal will be remembered as the night when Indian women’s cricket found its heartbeat — and showed the world its fire.</div></div>",

In preliminary discussions, the company has looked at raising $60 billion at the low end and likely more, the people said. They cautioned that talks are early and plans - including the figures and timing - could change depending on business growth and market conditions.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tChief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing, the people said. But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said. \"We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.\"<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe IPO preparations signal a new urgency inside the ChatGPT maker to tap public markets now that a complex restructuring is complete that reduces its reliance on Microsoft. An IPO would open the door to more efficient capital raising and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping to finance CEO Sam Altman's plans to pour trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWith an annualized revenue run rate expected to reach about $20 billion by year-end, losses are also mounting inside the $500 billion company, the people said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring a livestream on Tuesday, Altman addressed the possibility of going public. \"I think it's fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we'll have,\" he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIPO PREPARATIONS FOLLOW MAJOR RESTRUCTURING<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tOpenAI started out as a nonprofit in 2015. A few years later, the company overhauled its structure again so that the nonprofit would have oversight and control over the for-profit arm. The main goal of the nonprofit was to ensure that OpenAI developed AI technology safely, rather than prioritizing profits like a traditional company.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis week, OpenAI revamped itself yet again. It is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but the nonprofit has a 26 per cent stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. This change makes the nonprofit a significant stakeholder in OpenAI's financial success.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tA successful offering would mark a major win for investors such as SoftBank, Thrive Capital and Abu Dhabi's MGX. Microsoft, one of its biggest backers, now owns about 27 per cent of the company after investing $13 billion.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe deliberations come as AI is driving a surge in public markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud company CoreWeave went public at a $23 billion valuation and has roughly tripled since. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value, powered by a rally that has cemented its role at the center of the global AI boom.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the possibility of OpenAI going public as early as 2027.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) has sought a series of direct tax measures aimed at boosting investor confidence, particularly in digital infrastructure, and called for simplifying compliance and reducing litigation, in its pre-Budget submission to the revenue secretary.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA key demand relates to tax certainty for global data centre players looking to invest in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe chamber said the government should ensure that foreign entities availing data centre services from India are not treated as having a business connection, significant economic presence (SEP) or permanent establishment in the country.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Setting up an approved data centre requires significant long-term investment. Given the size and scale, availability of land/necessary resources, there is a huge opportunity for India to attract investments from large digital players to set up data centres in India through their subsidiaries/affiliates,” it said, warning that lack of clarity could deter multinational investment.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that Indian subsidiaries providing such services should get a safe harbour regime with prescribed margins, given the long gestation period for data centre projects.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSafe harbour should be effective from the date of operationalisation and applicable for at least 15 years, the chamber argued. It added that costs related to foreign affiliates’ technology or data stored in India should be excluded while computing margins.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn easing business rules for digital firms, Assocham sought removal of non-digital transactions such as import of goods from the scope of SEP.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt said the provision currently could force Indian businesses to deduct tax even where the non-resident has no physical or digital presence in India.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt urged the government to issue attribution guidelines and exempt taxpayers eligible for treaty benefits from SEP reporting.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAssocham stated that “consequently, any Indian resident who makes payments to non-residents who have SEP in India may be obligated to withhold tax prior to making payment, to such non-residents” which creates uncertainty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo support domestic reorganisation, the chamber said fast-track mergers and demergers under the Companies Act be granted tax neutrality.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that a blanket denial compels companies to avail the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) route only and the fast-track route will be futile.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also pushed for expanding tax-neutral treatment to all forms of entity conversions and for allowing loss carry-forward under such restructurings.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThese should be simplified and expanded so as to enable businesses and investors to optimise their operations and holdings without facing tax costs, it said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn manufacturing, Assocham urged the government to revive the 15 per cent concessional corporate tax regime for new units to sustain investments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis will enable India to remain attractive for making fresh capital investment, provide a boost to the domestic economy and also encourage exports, it argued.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAddressing stressed-asset resolutions, the chamber sought exemption for loan waivers granted under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), stressing that taxing waived debt “goes contrary to the purpose behind the IBC.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also requested clarity on depreciation for assets partly used for business.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAssocham asked that write-off of receivables be excluded from TDS under Section 194R, stating that requiring tax deduction on irrecoverable amounts is “doubly onerous” for creditors.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor small entrepreneurs and the agriculture ecosystem, Assocham argued that farmers and farmer-producer organisations should be exempt from TDS on e-commerce transactions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt said the current rule imposes an undue burden on farmers, especially where platforms do not handle billing or collection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe chamber also sought alignment of tax treatment of government subsidies with actual cash receipt to ease liquidity pressure on companies, observing that “actual receipt generally takes two to three years.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo spur hiring, it proposed raising the salary threshold for claiming deduction on new employees to ₹50,000 per month and extending the incentive to contractual workers, saying employment generation is a key issue for the country and the limits fixed in 2016 are outdated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn transfer pricing, Assocham urged restoration of the earlier definition of associated enterprises, warning that the current language could trigger disputes merely on account of participation in management or capital.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFinally, the chamber made a strong pitch for speeding up dispute adjudication and widening safe harbours. Advance rulings should be delivered within defined timelines, it said, while seeking broader coverage for safe harbours and raising the limit for the dispute resolution committee from ₹10 lakh to ₹50 lakh to encourage more small taxpayers to opt for it.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
