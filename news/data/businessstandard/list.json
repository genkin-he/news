That’s where the concept of heart age comes in.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDeveloped from research published in the British Heart Journal, VitaLyfe’s algorithm calculates a user’s “heart age” using clinical markers such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits, helping users quantify and reduce their “heart age gap.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Corporate-first model for affordable wellness</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAvailable initially through employers, insurers, and brokers, the platform follows a B2B2C model, with corporate health plans serving as the primary entry point. “The need is highest among corporate employees. HR heads are genuinely concerned about young professionals in their 30s and 40s facing sudden cardiac events,” Srinivasan noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEmployers are willing to allocate ₹5,000–₹8,000 per employee for wellness programmes, while VitaLyfe is priced under ₹1,000, making it accessible and scalable.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOnce onboarded, users undergo a “risk stratification” process that translates raw health data into insights such as heart age, gap contributors, and lifestyle risks. The app then sets measurable goals — such as lowering heart age by two years or losing five kilos — and deploys AI-driven interventions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKey features include photo-based meal tracking, camera-guided exercise correction, guided meditation routines, and gamified challenges that encourage team participation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve already tested VitaLyfe with around 5,000 employees in beta, and engagement has been very strong,” Srinivasan said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Backed by Lupin’s clinical and digital expertise</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRajeev Sibal, President, India Region Formulations at Lupin, said, “With VitaLyfe, we are enabling insurers and employers to combine clinical expertise with AI-driven technology to deliver scalable, measurable wellness outcomes for millions of working Indians.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe platform, compliant with India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act and ISO 27001-certified, stores all user data securely within India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Expanding beyond cardiac care into preventive wellness</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor LDH, VitaLyfe marks a strategic expansion beyond post-discharge cardiac care into preventive wellness. The company, which partners with over 50 hospitals, currently derives 60–70 per cent of its revenue from digital therapeutics for cardiac patients.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the immediate focus is adoption, Srinivasan sees significant growth potential. “Look at India’s white-collar workforce and the growing burden of cardiometabolic diseases. The sky’s the limit,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVitaLyfe is expected to gain strong traction as employers renew group insurance plans for 2025. Looking ahead, LDH plans to extend its digital therapeutics model to metabolic disorders and oncology, supported by clinical validation.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We don’t launch anything without scientific evidence,” Srinivasan said. “Preventive wellness is still underinvested in India, but through employers and insurers, we can make it engaging and free for users.”</div></div>",

In a conversation with <strong>Nivedita Mookerji</strong> at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Summit 2025, she warns that no organisation can survive without a robust information-technology (IT) backbone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you look at the world of technology after coming from SBI, and it has been five years at Salesforce now?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven at the bank, I strongly believed that any organisation not taking IT seriously will not sustain itself. Whether you’re a small family-run shop or in HR, logistics, manufacturing, or services — a strong IT backbone is essential. Technology is evolving at an unprecedented speed. We are now working with Agentic AI, and in just 13 months we have covered enormous ground, enabling Agentic enterprises. The pace of change is extraordinary, even within tech.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>From the world of SBI to this speed of technology, how has the transition been?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSBI teaches you to lead while learning. Because you’re transferred often — to different locations and across verticals and teams — you learn on your feet. I used to say that once I found a good hairdresser and tailor for my saree blouses, it was time to be transferred! This environment prepares you to add value immediately, which helped me in transitioning from 40 years in banking to working with people five generations younger.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>If you were to describe your journey as a woman leader, how would you put it?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI never thought of it in a precise way. For a woman in India with a career, it’s a constant calibration between family responsibilities and work. There are moments when you wonder if it’s worth it, but you must accept the reality and still move forward. Many women ask if I faced difficulty getting junior male colleagues to listen. I didn’t. Either I was lucky or any comments never reached me. I think what worked was my ability to communicate in a way that excited them as much as it did me. When people are convinced and energised, the gender of the leader doesn’t matter.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you share a few things you did for your women colleagues, apart from allowing sabbaticals?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe sabbatical was one, and I hoped other public-sector banks would follow, though they haven’t yet. I still hope they do, because it’s very helpful. I noticed many women were in platform roles, not in branch operations like their male colleagues. To qualify for the next promotion, they needed two years in an independent role and two years in rural service. Yet, in rural areas, landlords wouldn’t rent premises to single women. So, we identified rural branches women could commute to, or we rented accommodation in the bank’s name with multiple rooms for women branch managers. Many opted for these roles, and some told me those shared years were the best of their lives.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe also implemented cervical-cancer vaccination for all women staffers and their wards. And I tried to ensure that in major centres, we had at least one lady doctor — a gynaecologist or paediatrician — so women didn’t have to spend time outside arranging appointments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>There was a time when we had many woman CEOs across banks. Not any longer. What happened?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen I left, I left behind a strong pipeline of women, many of whom have achieved a lot. My former chief financial officer (CFO) is now CFO of the World Bank. Another headed Indian Bank and later NSDL. Women who were deputy managing director then have gone on to lead in several places. The glass ceiling still exists and takes time and effort to break. We were fortunate to have a strong cohort across PSBs, private and foreign banks. I recall a reception hosted by Raghuram Rajan (who was Reserve Bank of India governor from 2013 to 2016) — there were more sarees than suits in the room!</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>As a banker earlier, how do you look at the banking universe today from the outside?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator plays a significant role. The sector’s challenges today are different. One of the biggest now is technology — how banks use it to deliver better services, and how they reconcile the fact that work done by people can now be done by digital agents that can think, generate, and act. Banks must leverage tech to reach the last mile — to 600,000 villages where financial literacy is still lacking but crucial for unlocking India’s potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBFSI is the most digitally mature sector, so it must absorb new technology and use it daily to deliver the best to customers and show the way for other industries.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>During your SBI tenure, you took steps to bring in technology. SBI was called a “Smart Bank”. Looking back, could you have done more?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe did what we could at that time. Many things available today weren’t available then. When YONO launched, it was far ahead of private or foreign banks. The risk-management techniques we put in place, tech for credit underwriting, reaching the right customers through inclusion efforts, and the range of products — we pushed the envelope. With hindsight, perhaps we could have focused more on agility. You can’t be agile and nimble when you are working with systems that are very stodgy and are rooted in the past, which are a lot of legacy. You can’t write off all technical debt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Other than technology, was there any other unfinished business?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCustomer service will always remain a work in progress because expectations keep rising. Take technology: Customers want safety, but if we add multiple login layers, they complain; if login is easier, they worry about risk.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tIndia’s private equity (PE) story is still gathering steam, say top fund managers, who argue that unutilised capital is less a sign of caution and more a natural transition as the market matures.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt a discussion during the <em>Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025</em> in Mumbai, industry leaders including Hari Gopalakrishnan (EQT Partners), Gopal Jain (Gaja Capital), Abhishek Kabra (Samara Capital), and Manish Kejriwal (Kedaara Capital) shared insights on India’s evolving private equity ecosystem, its growing domestic capital base, and the shift towards larger, more sophisticated deals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tPrivate equity finds its stride</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPrivate equity in India has been active for over 25 years, and its role in the country’s economic transformation is undeniable, said Gopalakrishnan, partner and India head at Swedish investment group EQT PF.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India is the fastest-growing large economy in the world, and we expect it to remain a global driver for demand in private equity,” he said. “Despite decades of activity, the sector here is still underpenetrated, which leaves room for significant expansion.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tPE moves from margins to the mainstream</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tJain, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) at Gaja Capital, agreed that the industry is on the verge of mainstream acceptance. “Private equity in India punches below its weight,” he noted. “But we now have the data and momentum to show that PE and venture capital are moving from niche to mainstream. Just as mutual funds and insurance became household names, alternatives are following suit.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Jain, the next phase of growth will hinge on domestic capital pools connecting India’s deep savings ecosystem with private equity and venture capital. “Every large economy eventually funds itself domestically. India is reaching that stage,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tMarket-beating returns</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra, partner at Samara Capital, highlighted that private equity has consistently outperformed public markets globally, and India’s story mirrors that trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Globally, PE has outperformed public markets by about 6–7 per cent on a 10-year rolling basis,” he said. “In India, deal flow has picked up sharply. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices are increasing allocations to alternative funds — from 7–8 per cent now to a projected 15–16 per cent.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe identified three pillars driving mainstreaming: fundraising, deal flow, and exits. “We now have vibrant opportunities in growth capital, buyouts, and even secondary exits. IPOs, domestic M&amp;As, SME listings — all of these complete a healthy investment cycle,” Kabra added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExits and buyouts mark a new phase</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKedaara Capital’s founder and managing partner Kejriwal said India’s “sweet spot” stems from improved exit markets and a cultural shift among family-owned businesses. “Fifteen years ago, India was good at attracting capital but not returning it,” he said. “That’s changed. We’ve had robust IPOs, sponsor-to-sponsor sales, and rising acceptance among business families to sell strategic stakes. Selling is no longer seen as a mark of shame,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuyouts, once rare, now account for half of all private equity deals, noted Gopalakrishnan. “In 2013, buyouts made up just 20 per cent of the market. With succession planning more common and the economy larger, both the pool of opportunities and transaction sizes have risen.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s scale advantage</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India becomes the world’s fifth-largest economy, global investors are paying closer attention. “Private equity works in large and sophisticated economies,” said Gaja Capital’s Jain. “Until recently, India was neither large nor sophisticated enough. That’s changed. We now have the scale, entrepreneurs, and IPO markets to support sustained private equity growth.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKejriwal added that while India remains an “entrepreneurial country of immense depth”, the PE industry is still at the level of a cottage industry. “We’ve barely scratched the surface. The best years are yet to come,” he predicted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI and the next investment wave</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn whether artificial intelligence (AI) will reshape investment patterns, Kejriwal struck a cautious tone: “We’re not chasing the AI hype. For us, the focus is on how our portfolio companies adopt AI efficiently, rather than betting on untested products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra echoed the sentiment, saying India’s role in AI will be more about building supportive infrastructure than developing frontier models. “We’re investing in the ecosystem — from data structuring to chip manufacturing — to future-proof our portfolios,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is a constant game of adapting. Our job is to future-proof the businesses we invest in,” said Gopalakrishnan.</div></div>",
