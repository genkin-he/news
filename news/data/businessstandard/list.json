It ensures the safety of marine animals during their breeding and mating season, said officials, adding that the ban has been clamped in accordance with Sections 2, 7 and 4 of Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act (OMFRA), 1982 and provisions of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ban will be strictly implemented as it is done every year to save turtles, as these endangered species perish in larger numbers either by getting entangled in fishing nets or being hit by fishing trawler propellers, an official said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAs per the arrangements, a multi-layered patrolling exercise will be done involving the forest, fisheries, and marine police, besides the coast guard personnel.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo ensure effective patrolling, 61 on-shore camps and five off-shore camps have been set up in the state's four wildlife divisions - Bhadrak, Rajnagar, Puri and Berhampur.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe armed police force will flank the forest and fisheries patrolling teams. Five high-speed boats, 13 trawlers and support boats are pressed into service to intercept illegal marine fishing in prohibited zones, said Sudrashan Gopinath Yadav, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (wildlife) Forest Division.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAround 11,000 fishermen families will be affected due to the ban. To compensate for the loss of income avenues, the state government has decided to extend one-time livelihood assistance of Rs 15,000 to the affected fishermen families, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOdisha Traditional Fish Workers Union (OTFWU), an organisation of fishermen, however, demanded that the amount be enhanced to Rs 30,000 and include all families depending on fishing-related works, including small-time fish traders under the scheme.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tK Yellayya, general secretary of the union, said they demand a reduction of the ban period from seven months to five months and from 20 km from the coast to 5 km and provide alternative livelihood support to all affected families, depending on fishing and its related activities<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe female turtles virtually invade the nesting beaches usually at the dead of the night for laying eggs, the phenomenon otherwise described as 'Arribada'. After laying eggs, the turtles leave the nesting ground and enter the sea. Hatchlings emerge from these eggs after 45-60 days. It is a rare natural phenomenon where the babies grow without their mother.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Once in orbit, CMS-03 will provide multi-band communication services over a wide region that includes the Indian landmass and nearby ocean areas.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe CMS-03 satellite is designed to improve telecom, television broadcasting, and broadband services across India and its surrounding oceans. It will replace older satellites and help strengthen connectivity for remote regions, ships, and aircraft over the Indian Ocean.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How does the rocket work?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rocket works in three stages. In the first stage, two giant boosters called S200 solid boosters fire up together to lift the rocket off the ground. These boosters are packed with solid fuel that burns very quickly, producing a strong thrust to overcome the earth’s gravity. They burn for about 134 seconds (a little over two minutes) before separating and falling away once their fuel is used up.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the second stage, known as the L110 liquid core stage, the main liquid engine starts working while the solid boosters are still burning — about 113 seconds into the flight. It uses liquid fuel, which allows more precise control over the rocket’s movement. As the rocket climbs higher, about 115 km above the earth, the payload fairing (the top cover that protects the satellite during launch) opens and drops off since there’s no more air resistance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFinally, the third stage, called the C25 cryogenic stage, takes over after the liquid stage completes its job at around 313 seconds. “Cryogenic” means it runs on super-cold fuel stored at extremely low temperatures. This stage gives the final, powerful push needed to place the satellite into space. It continues burning until the satellite reaches its target — the GTO, a very high orbit roughly 36,000 km above the earth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why is the launch important?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIf the launch is successful, it will become the heaviest satellite ever launched from the Indian soil. It will reaffirm LVM3’s capability to let India launch heavy satellites independently, without depending on foreign launchers. Meanwhile, the CMS-03 will support digital connectivity, disaster management, and secure communication services, marking another major step forward in India’s space journey.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n</div>",

Our approach is not transactional, but rather long-term and principle-driven,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We believe that the Indo-Pacific should remain open, inclusive, and free from any form of coercion,\" he noted.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ADMM-Plus is a platform comprising 11-nation Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its eight dialogue partners -- India, China, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Let us all together reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding and strengthening the Asean-led, inclusive regional security architecture, which has served our region so admirably,\" Singh said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Let us all move forward together so that the Indo-Pacific remains a region of peace, stability, and shared prosperity for generations to come,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSingh said India is ready to enhance cooperation in all areas of mutual interests, promote dialogue, and ensure peace and stability through robust regional mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"The experience of the past 15 years teaches us some things in a clear manner, namely that inclusive cooperation is effective; regional ownership brings legitimacy, and collective security strengthens everyone's individual sovereignty,\" he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"In the coming years, these same principles will continue to guide India's approach towards ADMM-Plus and Asean,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said India is ready to continue making constructive contributions in this endeavour in the spirit of its vision MAHASAGAR or Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth across Regions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"India sees its defence cooperation with Asean and Plus countries as a contribution to regional peace, stability, and capacity-building,\" Singh said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe defence minister noted that the ADMM-Plus have proven in the last 15 years that cooperation based on trust, inclusivity, and respect for sovereignty is not only necessary but also possible.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Now, its next phase must adapt itself to emerging realities in accordance with these foundations,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"The evolution of ADMM-Plus reflects the changing security realities of our region. Now this platform is also active in new areas such as cyber threats, maritime domain awareness, and critical infrastructure protection,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This platform has proven that non-traditional security cooperation can be an effective medium for building trust between nations.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe defence minister said the ADMM-Plus for India is an integral part of its 'Act East Policy' and broader Indo-Pacific vision.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ADMM-Plus is a key platform under the overarching framework of Asean.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIndia became the dialogue partner of Asean in 1992, and the inaugural ADMM-Plus was convened in Hanoi in October 2010.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"India has always emphasised the need to integrate climate resilience into defence cooperation. The relationship between environmental stress, resource scarcity, and conflict makes this subject an essential component of the regional security agenda,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSingh said India's Indo-Pacific security vision links defence cooperation with economic development, technology sharing, and human resource advancement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This strong connection between the interlinkages of Security, Growth, and sustainability is the true spirit of the partnership between India and Asean,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSingh said the emphasis placed on \"inclusivity and sustainability\" under Malaysia's chairmanship of Asean is both timely and highly relevant.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"In the context of security, inclusivity means that all countries, regardless of their size or capacity, become equal partners in building the regional order and benefit from it,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Sustainability means creating such security architectures that are resilient to shocks, can adapt to new challenges, and are based on long-term cooperation rather than short-term alignment,\" he said.</p><p></p></div>",
