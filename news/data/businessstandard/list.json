            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tFor <strong>Tuhin Kanta Pandey, chairman</strong>, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), trust is the cornerstone of India’s fast-expanding capital markets — and it must be earned every day through action, not announcement.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a candid conversation with <strong>Tamal Bandyopadhyay</strong>, he talks of how Sebi is sharpening surveillance, using technology to protect investors, recalibrating rules on initial public offering (IPO) and futures &amp; options (F&amp;Os), responding to concerns of foreign investors, and why the regulator is focused on simplification rather than arming itself with more powers. Edited excerpts.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>At your very first board meeting, you spoke about building public trust and sorting out conflict of interest. How do you settle issues and conflicts — not just in the market but also within Sebi? Where are we today on these issues?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIt’s important to understand that Sebi is an institution. It has been nurtured and developed by several of my predecessors, along with industry and market participants, through collaboration. Today, Sebi has a strong reputation not only in India but also overseas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tTrust is critical, both internally and externally. It does not come from a single measure — there is no magic wand. It stems from a series of actions: Our language, how we communicate, our regulatory framework, and a fair and judicious application of regulations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier there was concern over whether we had a robust internal framework on managing conflict of interest. We had set up a high-level committee on this aspect. The committee has been deliberating on the matter and engaging with several internal and external stakeholders. I expect its report to be submitted in a few days, possibly by November 10. We will take the next steps, based on its recommendations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>We have never had any five-year period during which foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sold so much. Is it only about valuation, or is there something else?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the basis of my interaction with FPIs and other participants in foreign markets, I find their confidence in India remains high. They believe in India’s long-term growth story and also see short-term opportunities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFPIs’ market capitalisation in India is about $900 billion. They allocate across global markets and assess where they can get the best returns. So, an outflow of $45 billion in the past year — with some months of positive flows and some negative — must be seen in proportion. The outflow of $45 billion on a base of $900 billion is not very significant.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, FPIs have given feedback on improving access, simplifying processes, and addressing pain points. We are working on those. We have simplified and digitised FPI registration.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India has one of the largest primary markets, but you recently reduced the size of a minimum public offer (MPO) in an IPO and the minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirement for listed companies. Is there a disconnect?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLet me clarify: We have not diluted the norms on MPS. MPS remains at 25 per cent — unchanged. What we examined was the MPO and the time allowed for companies to achieve MPS.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe markets have expanded. After the IPO of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), we began discussing companies with a ₹6 trillion market cap coming to the market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStrict timelines on MPS can act like a Damocles’ sword, potentially hurting minority shareholders due to price volatility. So, we took a realistic view of what the market can absorb. After extensive consultations and excellent feedback, we introduced multiple pathways to achieving compliance on MPS and MPO, without compromising on investor protection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>MFs enjoy a tax advantage over portfolio management services and alternative investment funds. That's one side of the story. On the other hand, while the Reserve Bank of India is paving the way for banks to lend more to earn more interest income, Sebi is limiting the sources of MF income. Yes, I am referring to the new discussion paper on the expense ratio ...</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs are critical for retail participation. We have 56 million unique investors. The industry has grown rapidly but is still 20-25 per cent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP). In advanced economies, MFs’ assets under management are 80-85 per cent of GDP.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs must grow faster because they provide a safer way for retail investors to enter the market and promote long-term investing. Their tax status is aligned with that structure — it is a pass-through model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MF industry has grown significantly and become more professional. We cannot constrain it. That is why we introduced options like specialised investment funds and other reforms, allowing more activities with appropriate risk segregation. Simplifying regulations has been a key objective. Some proposals on the fee structure stem from the need for greater clarity, fairness, and transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi research shows 90-93 per cent of individual investors lose money in F&amp;Os. There has been so much discussion on easing out weekly F&amp;Os. When will we see that?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a sensitive subject and requires thoughtful handling. We adopted a calibrated approach and implemented a series of measures to improve the market after five rounds of consultation. Initially, we received diverse views, which we reconciled.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome measures have taken effect; others will kick in as late as December 1. Some began in October, some in July, and more are scheduled for May 2026. We have introduced guardrails — limiting expiries to only two days a week and one index per day — to curb irrational exuberance among retail investors less aware of the workings of the market. Statutory warnings have also been included on the trading screen.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the same time, many market participants actively use derivatives products. We cannot abruptly shut down the market. Therefore, any further steps will be released for public consultation. Stakeholders can evaluate the data and provide feedback before we proceed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will the IPO of the National Stock Exchange see the light of day during your tenure?</strong></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> Of course, unless you want my tenure to be very short.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you take us through Sebi’s “30-second cyber-security check”?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is an important initiative by Sebi. With support from market participants, banks, and others, we have developed a unique system — the first of its kind globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia is a global leader in Unified Payments Interface and digital public infrastructure. With 45-50 per cent of the world’s digital transactions happening in India, convenience is high, but that also enables fraudsters. Our objective is to end the ease of doing fraud. We must protect millions of investors at scale.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMany people spend time choosing vegetables or comparing products, but not even 30 seconds checking if their securities account is secure. The “30-Second Check” on Sebi’s Saarthi app enables users to quickly verify bank-account linkage, demat-account security, MF statements, the validity of the advisor or intermediary, and whether any unauthorised transfer or pledge has taken place.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a systemic, preventive effort — unique globally. The aim is for current and potential investors to be aware so that they do not lose money. Market risk is understood — but fraud risk must be avoided.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the latest on finfluencers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe are doing around 5,000 takedowns every month, and have taken down over 100,000 pieces of content from platforms with support from Google, Meta, and others. With better tools and platforms deploying artificial intelligence more effectively, we should be able to act even more forcefully.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi has gained more teeth over the years. Do you need additional powers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have adequate powers. We must use them judiciously, sensibly, and consistently. We also need to keep upgrading our surveillance tools — which we are doing. If we have done well, we must do even better. If we keep exercising these powers responsibly, we will continue to maintain public trust in the capital markets — because as a watchdog, that is our duty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You recently launched an e-office in Sebi. Is that correct?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat’s correct. Sebi was, I admit, late in adopting it. This will strengthen efficiency in the organisation. I can say we are fortunate to have some of the finest minds at Sebi.</div></div>",

All of us are gearing up with the hope that the demand generated will build self-reliance in commercial shipbuilding. The demand will come from both public and private sectors as their commercial vessels were being built outside India — now these will come to India,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSDHI recently partnered with South Korean shipbuilding giant Samsung Heavy Industries for technical assistance. The company will tap the latter’s expertise for large specialised orders as it plans global foray.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the brownfield expansion programme of the scheme, existing shipyards can avail an assistance of 25 per cent of the capital expenditure undertaken.

The second, apparently favorite, son of Queen Elizabeth II has not only lost his many titles but also his home.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tHe’s been kicked out of his lavish grace-and-favor mansion in the grounds of Windsor Castle after elder brother King Charles III’s patience finally snapped.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAn endless torrent of ugly revelations related to his closeness to pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein became unbearable for a family whose No. 1 job is to embody a dignified permanence at the heart of the British state.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tCharles has long sought a slimmed down version of “the firm,” the name by which the working royals have come to be known.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tIn stripping the former princeling of any place in public life, he’s shown a ruthlessness and moral clarity others should try.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe U.S. Congress and Trump administration need to do now what many of the president’s supporters want and open the full Epstein files to public scrutiny.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite having paid her a reported £12 million ($15.8 million) to settle a legal case and that infamous photograph showing them together, Mountbatten Windsor continues to deny having had sex with Virginia Giuffre, the woman abused by Epstein and trafficked to his powerful friends.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tHer memoir posthumously published this month describes in detail what she alleges these men, including the ex-prince, did to her.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMountbatten Windsor’s credibility suffered further damage when a tabloid published an alleged email from him suggesting he’d dissembled about the date on which he’d last had contact with Epstein.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAnother alleged message appeared to show he’d asked his taxpayer-funded protection detail to dig up dirt on his accuser. Police are investigating that potential abuse of power. The ex-prince has consistently denied all claims against him.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAs Charles’ shock statement defenestrating his brother landed on Thursday evening, Giuffre’s family made clear not only their pride in her for bravely challenging the account of a powerful prince, but that justice for the surviving victims must follow.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThey are right. Mountbatten Windsor still has questions to answer about what he saw at Epstein’s mansion. He should finally give evidence in cases pending against the billionaire’s estate. But this shameful episode goes way beyond the alleged deeds of one blue-blooded ne'er-do-well.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tGiuffre’s book is a Who’s Who of rich, powerful men, and some women, whom she encountered during the horrendous two years she traveled the world with the disgraced financier. They allegedly include dozens of politicians, business leaders and academics, whose friendship he cultivated in the vain hope it would make him look weighty and clever.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong them is an individual she refers to as the ex-minister, whom she claims was the most violent of her rapists. During one alleged assault she said she thought she would die, yet when she complained to Epstein he allegedly told her: “You’ll get that sometimes.” It was this nonchalant absence of concern that made Giuffre realize he cared little for her welfare.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThat the outrage over Epstein and his coterie hasn’t died down over the past decade suggests the public does care, viscerally. Charles’ humiliation of his own brother is living proof.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe elite figures who cozied up to the financier, lapping up the wealthy trappings without questioning his surrounding himself with very young “masseuses,” need to tell us what they saw. Though it may be a long wait, given the omerta so far.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tA few years ago, a shocking photo emerged of the model Naomi Campbell’s 31st birthday party on board a yacht, in which a child-like Giuffre can be seen in the foreground. What were the other guests thinking?<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tGiuffre names Bill Clinton, Al and Tipper Gore and many others in her book as people who saw her with Epstein (she doesn’t accuse Clinton or either Gore of abuse). It’s time for witnesses to come forward, including the many cooks, housekeepers, pilots, personal assistants and other staff retained by Epstein.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tFor the past year, Congress and the White House have obfuscated, using political tricks such as early recess and the government shutdown to prevent disclosing the hundreds of gigabytes of data plus other material held by the FBI relating to Epstein and associates, including his jailed girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe’ve already learned plenty from the limited release of the Epstein files so far, helped by my colleagues on Bloomberg News. In September, the UK ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, had to resign over revelations by Bloomberg that he kept associating with Epstein after the pedophile’s first incarceration. Now Windsor Mountbatten has been sacked by the royal family.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhy has the British establishment, not known historically for its alacrity, acted more swiftly than its US counterpart to try to cut out the Epstein cancer. UK tabloids are ferocious diggers, but public disgust at the affair and hunger for justice is no less potent in America. Quite the opposite.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to his own accounts of his sometime friendship with Epstein, Donald Trump has nothing to fear from a full release of the files. Giuffre said the president didn’t abuse or mistreat her, and she never saw him at Epstein properties. The legislative and executive branches of the US government should take their cue from the UK’s non-executive chairman, King Charles.
