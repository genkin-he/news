There is no problem of capital availability. Both banks and corporates are doing very well; their balance sheets are in good shape,” he said. Dev also pointed out that uncertainty remains a challenge for private sector investment despite improving macro indicators.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDev emphasised that exports and investment remain the key growth drivers, while multiple government stimulus measures and monetary easing are expected to spur further private investment. “Multiple stimulus measures by the government, coupled with a reduction in interest rates, will lead to further private investment,” he said, noting a revival of private capex in technology sectors such as data centres, electronics, and renewables.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn manufacturing, Dev explained that while the sector’s share in GDP might appear stagnant, its output had risen sharply — by 75 per cent between FY15 and FY25. “It’s not stagnant; services have simply grown faster,” he said. He added that employment elasticity in manufacturing had turned positive after the pandemic, reflecting renewed strength.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDrawing attention to regional disparities, Dev called for strengthening cooperative federalism to ensure balanced development. “The experience of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council shows that cooperative federalism works,” he said, urging expansion of cooperative federalism beyond GST to cover development and fiscal matters to accelerate inclusive growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDev highlighted India’s federal structure and noted that many states had announced ambitious targets for 2047, with Telangana aiming to become a $3-trillion economy. “States play an important role, but decentralisation stops with them; we also have to decentralise to panchayats and municipal councils,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStressing the importance of inclusion, Dev described quality employment as the “most important component of inclusive growth.” He underscored the need to boost women’s labour force participation and improve employability in both rural and urban areas. He also urged preparation for green industrialisation, noting that climate action and net-zero transitions must involve state- and district-level planning.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe highlighted new opportunities across traditional manufacturing, modern industries, and global value chains, and underscored the importance of rare earth production and technology sectors for India’s long-term competitiveness.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Viksit Bharat is not just about achieving growth. It must also be inclusive and sustainable,” Dev said, adding that India’s long-term success depends on moving towards a labour-intensive, high-growth manufacturing model and a society that is prosperous, inclusive, and pro-nature.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tIndia’s capital markets need a stronger presence of industry practitioners in policy roles to reduce errors and improve decision-making, said Ananth Narayan G, former whole-time member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a conversation with <em>Business Standard’s</em> Khushboo Tiwari at <em>BFSI Insight Summit</em> in Mumbai on Friday, Narayan stressed the need for what he called “a good mix of practitioners and people with common sense” within Sebi and the broader financial ecosystem. “For the ecosystem to grow, we need practitioners as policymakers in Sebi. Sebi covers a vast area. These are very niche which requires depth,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tChallenge of interpreting feedback</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan outlined the two key mistakes regulators often face. “A type 1 error is when we let bad things happen, regulators hate it. The type 2 error is when, in our zeal to prevent type 1, we come out with a 10,000-page circular that makes life tough for practitioners,” he said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that Sebi consults widely through advisory committees and industry forums, but the challenge lies in interpreting that feedback. “Not every stakeholder is adequately represented, and there are natural conflicts of interest. You need expertise at the deciding level to minimise both type 1 and type 2 errors,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tBalance between policy design and market experience<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></h3>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan argued that the quality of regulatory outcomes depends on this balance between policy design and market experience. “You have smart people at the policy and regulatory level, but you can’t become an expert just by being a smart person,” he said. “You also need checks and balances to prevent conflicts of interest. If we have a good ecosystem to manage it, that’s our best bet to minimise errors.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReferring to Sebi’s ongoing focus on the derivatives market, he said data had shown that retail investors are facing heavy losses. “Total losses by retail traders in futures and options in FY25 were ₹1 trillion,” he said. “The volume of trade, particularly on index expiry days, is simply not sustainable.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan added that the regulator’s intent was to strike a balance without being overly interventionist. “Our intent is to manage three risks: retail losses, instability in the market, and the quality of the derivative curve, without playing god in the derivatives market,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCaution on valuations and liquidity<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></h3>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the issue of valuations and market liquidity, Narayan cautioned that exuberance in equities required vigilance. “In FY25, the net demand for equities through mutual funds was ₹6.25 trillion. Including other domestic institutional investors and individuals, the total demand was ₹8.8 trillion, equivalent to $100 billion. The net supply was ₹4.6 trillion. This gap is the highest we’ve ever seen,” he said, calling for greater investor education and awareness about risk and diversification.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCiting foreign portfolio investor (FPI) reforms, Narayan said Sebi’s approach in recent years was a case of managing the balance well. “We could not create a regime so silly that FPIs would refuse to come,” he said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan added that Sebi had worked to streamline processes such as T+1 settlement and ensure FPIs received tax certificates early to avoid delays. “On capital gains tax, we must be conscious, most large jurisdictions don’t apply it to FPIs. To stand out, we must be careful.”</div></div>",

India consumes around 10–11 million tonnes of DAP annually, making it the second-largest fertiliser consumed in the country after urea.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDAP is a key crop nutrient consumed during the rabi sowing season, which begins in a few weeks, and is widely used in the production of wheat and potatoes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn FY25, India imported close to 5 million tonnes of DAP, while the balance was produced domestically.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA few months ago, Saudi Arabia’s Maaden, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of DAP, signed a long-term agreement with three Indian fertiliser companies — Indian Potash Limited (IPL), KRIBHCO, and Chambal Fertilisers (CIL) — for the supply of 3.1 million metric tonnes of DAP annually for five years starting FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe agreement also includes a provision for a five-year extension based on mutual consent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Most domestic DAP made from imported raw materials</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost of the DAP manufactured locally in India is produced from rock phosphate, while some units manufacture DAP using imported phosphoric acid.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry sources said that a majority of the raw materials used for making DAP locally, such as rock phosphate, are imported because domestic grades are unsuitable for producing high-grade DAP. However, some units have facilities to produce phosphoric acid from rock phosphate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Import costs push losses despite higher subsidy</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrade sources said that assuming the current imported price of DAP is around $780 per tonne, it would translate into a value of around Rs 69,240.6 per tonne. To this, around Rs 1,000 per tonne is added for packing and handling, and a similar amount for finance and insurance fees.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTogether, this brings the total to around Rs 71,240.6 per metric tonne, with another Rs 3,462.03 added as taxes and duties.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn total, the expenditure on importing one tonne of DAP in India is currently around Rs 74,702.63, while the subsidy plus retail price account for around Rs 56,805 (Rs 27,000 retail price per tonne plus Rs 29,805 per tonne subsidy).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis leaves a gap of about Rs 17,897.63 per tonne, translating to a loss of roughly Rs 895 per 50-kg bag of imported DAP sold in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe calculation would differ for domestic manufacturers, as though the landed prices of rock phosphate and phosphoric acid have risen in recent months, they have not increased at the same rate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
