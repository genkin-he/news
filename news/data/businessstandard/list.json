In the first tranche, GCPL will make a payment of ₹289 crore for an enterprise value of ₹380 crore, and the second tranche will be paid 12 months later for approximately ₹160 crore at an enterprise value of ₹400–500 crore, the company said in its stock exchange filing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This brand is one of India’s fastest-growing men’s grooming brands, with a strong leadership position in the men’s facewash segment.

In the 12 months ending September 2025, the business recorded revenues of approximately ₹80 crore and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) — adjusted for one-offs — of around ₹30 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Indian facewash market, estimated at ₹6,000–7,000 crore, is growing at 15–20 per cent per annum, driven by rising awareness of skincare and an ongoing shift from soaps to more specialised cleansing formats.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/swan-eyes-875-crore-govt-assistance-for-pipavav-shipyard-expansion-125103101243_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Swan eyes ₹875 crore govt assistance for Pipavav Shipyard expansion</a></strong></div></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Within this, the men’s facewash category, valued at about ₹1,000 crore, is growing at over 25 per cent annually, making it one of the fastest-growing segments in personal care. The upgradation trend from soaps to facewash, supported by higher disposable incomes and changing grooming preferences, is expected to sustain strong momentum in the coming years,” the release added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are delighted to welcome the Muuchstac brand to Godrej Consumer Products. The brand’s strong resonance among younger consumers, high profitability, and proven digital execution model make it a powerful addition to our personal care portfolio. This acquisition enhances our participation in the fast-growing men’s grooming segment and supports our vision of building a future-ready, innovation-led GCPL,” said Sudhir Sitapati, managing director and chief executive officer at GCPL, in the release.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonak Bagadia and Vishal Lohia, founders of Muuchstac, said they look forward to the business scaling up in line with their vision of redefining men’s skincare in India and added that they will work closely with the team at Godrej for the same.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the July–September quarter, GCPL’s consolidated net profit fell 6.5 per cent to ₹459.3 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts net sales grew 4.3 per cent to ₹3,825.1 crore. It reported a volume growth of 3 per cent in the domestic business during the quarter under review.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 5.8 per cent in the quarter ended September to ₹796.2 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCommenting on its results, Sitapati said, “Q2 FY26 has been a resilient quarter for Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), especially given the backdrop of the GST transition in India and continued macroeconomic challenges in Indonesia. Despite these headwinds, our India business, excluding soaps, has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth, reflecting the strength of our core portfolio and execution.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said that the recent GST rate reduction is a welcome structural reform that will strengthen long-term consumer demand.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs warned by the company ahead of its earnings, Sitapati said in the release, “However, this transition led to short-term trade disruptions as the channel adjusted to new pricing and cleared old inventory, particularly impacting soaps and hair colour. Despite this, we continue to gain market share in soaps and other key categories.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that in October, the company entered the ₹3,000-crore toilet cleaner category, which is growing at strong double digits.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our new brand, Godrej Spic, has been launched in select South Indian states, priced competitively at ₹79 for 500 ml, marking an important step in expanding our home care portfolio,” he said.</div></div>",
