The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to practice genuine multilateralism, according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xi, Lee discuss North Korea</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tChinese state media reports on the Xi-Lee meeting didn't immediately carry any North Korea-related comments by Xi.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Wi Sung-lac, Lee's national security director, said Lee during the meeting outlined his strategy for achieving denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and requested a constructive Chinese role to help realise the resumption of talks with North Korea.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tXi replied that he would continue his efforts to help resolve issues involving the Korean Peninsula and promote peace and stability here, Wi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina is North Korea's traditional ally and economic pipeline, but there are still questions about how much leverage it has on its impoverished neighbour. China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing UN sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against US influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about its daydream of realising North Korea's denuclearisation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea, said earlier Saturday he would take more active preemptive steps to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said South Korea and China also signed several agreements on jointly combating online scams, expanding a bilateral free trade deal and renewing a currency swap deal that expired last month.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders call for greater cooperation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAfter two days of talks, APEC leaders vowed greater cooperation to tackle shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by rising protectionism and trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir joint statement declared that the APEC leaders \"acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenges.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, it says.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea's National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting free and open trade, which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC's mission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It wasn't possible to leave that out entirely, said Min.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe joint declaration also said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that's free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile the summit's opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday's meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAPEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, ageing populations and accelerated urbanisation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that investing in China is investing in the future.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEstablished in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration. But the region now faces challenges such as the US-China rivalry, supply chain disruptions, ageing populations and the impact of AI on jobs.</p><p></p></div>",

Still in absolute terms, net collections remained strong at Rs 1.69 trillion, making October the third best month of FY26 after April and May. In October last year, the net GST mop-up stood at Rs 1.68 trillion, while on a month-on-month basis, it grew 5.4 per cent from Rs 1.60 trillion in September.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tGross GST receipts in October stood at ₹1.96 trillion, an increase of 4.6 per cent year-on-year, supported by strong import-linked collections, which grew 12.8 per cent. Domestic GST revenues rose 2 per cent to ₹1.45 trillion. In the first seven months of FY26, net GST revenues have risen 7.1 per cent to ₹12.07 trillion, while gross collections have increased 9 per cent to ₹13.89 trillion.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTax experts attributed the soft print to the rate cut-induced recalibration by businesses and postponement of supplies in the run-up to the revised GST slabs from September 22. October GST collections reflect transactions undertaken in September, and therefore capture only a partial impact of the GST rate rationalisation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The GST collections, while aligning with immediate expectations, reflect a muted momentum due to the rate rationalisation effect in the majority part of September month and deferred consumer spending ahead of the festival season.

But in 2025, Laura Wolvaardt and her fearless Proteas side turned history on its head. From a disastrous opening game to scripting one of the greatest semi-final wins in World Cup history, South Africa’s journey to their maiden ICC Women’s ODI World Cup final has been nothing short of cinematic.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHere’s how the Rainbow Nation’s heroes wrote a new chapter in cricketing history - </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Nightmare Beginning: England Crush South Africa (October 3, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe tournament began on the worst possible note for South Africa. Facing England in their opener, they were bundled out for a mere 65 — their lowest-ever World Cup total. Sinalo Jafta (22) was the only batter to cross double digits as the English bowlers wreaked havoc. England chased down the target without losing a wicket, inflicting a 10-wicket defeat.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut rather than breaking them, the humiliation became a turning point, a wake-up call that ignited a fire within the Proteas camp.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Redemption Begins: Clinical Win Over New Zealand (October 6, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBattered but not beaten, South Africa regrouped and produced a superb comeback in their next game against New Zealand at Indore. The bowlers, led by Nonkululeko Mlaba (4/40), dismantled the Kiwi batting order, restricting them to 231.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChasing the target, opener Tazmin Brits (101) and Sune Luus (83) combined beautifully in a steady partnership to guide South Africa home by six wickets with 55 balls to spare. The victory wasn’t just about points, it was a statement that the Proteas were back in business.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Defining the Grit: Edging Past India in a Thriller (October 9, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe clash with hosts India in Visakhapatnam turned into an instant classic. Chasing 252, Laura Wolvaardt (70) anchored the innings with her characteristic calm, while Chloe Tryon (49) provided crucial momentum. But it was Nadine de Klerk’s ice-cool unbeaten 84* that sealed the deal, steering South Africa to a three-wicket victory with seven balls remaining.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat win against a powerhouse like India gave the Proteas belief, they could now dream big.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Another Close Finish: Bangladesh Nearly Upset the Party (October 13, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBangladesh gave South Africa a real scare in Colombo. Chasing 233, South Africa stumbled early before Marizanne Kapp (56) and Tryon (62) steadied the innings. Still, it took late fireworks from Nadine de Klerk (37* off 29) and Masabata Klaas (10* off 13) to clinch a narrow three-wicket win.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt was the kind of victory that defines champions, scrappy, hard-earned, and full of character.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/shreyas-iyer-health-update-batter-discharged-from-hospital-confirms-bcci-125110100363_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Shreyas Iyer health update: Batter discharged from hospital, confirms BCCI</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Back to Dominance: Ten-Wicket Win Against Sri Lanka (October 17, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter a string of tense finishes, the Proteas found their rhythm again in a rain-shortened encounter against Sri Lanka.

Skipper Wolvaardt led from the front with a fluent 90, supported by Sune Luus (61) and Marizanne Kapp (68*).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTheir imposing total of 312 was adjusted to 234 in a rain-affected game, but Pakistan faltered badly, losing by 150 runs.

Leg-spinner Alana King tore through the Proteas lineup with a stunning 7/18, dismissing them for just 98. Australia chased the target easily, winning by seven wickets.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe defeat dropped South Africa to third in the standings, setting up a daunting semi-final clash with tournament heavyweights England.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Semifinal Masterclass: Wolvaardt’s 169 and Kapp’s Magic (October 29, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCometh the hour, cometh the captain. Laura Wolvaardt delivered a once-in-a-lifetime innings in the semi-final at Guwahati, smashing a breathtaking 169 off 143 balls, the highest individual score of the tournament. Her knock propelled South Africa to a commanding 319, leaving England chasing shadows.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThen came the finishing act, Marizanne Kapp, the heartbeat of South African cricket, produced a masterclass with the ball, taking 5 wickets and becoming the all-time leading wicket-taker in Women’s World Cup history. England crumbled for 194, and the Proteas romped into their first-ever World Cup final with a 125-run win.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Date With Destiny</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom a 10-wicket humiliation to the grandest stage in world cricket, South Africa’s rise has been extraordinary. Under Laura Wolvaardt’s composed leadership, with Kapp’s all-round brilliance and de Klerk’s fearlessness, the Proteas have shattered barriers and inspired a generation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn November 2 at the DY Patil Stadium, they face Harmanpreet Kaur’s India, two teams hungry for their maiden crown. Whatever the result, South Africa have already won something greater: the hearts of fans and a place in cricketing history.</div></div>",
