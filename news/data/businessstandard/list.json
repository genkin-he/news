The effort backed by Gov Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tObama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation's first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tVirginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Democrats need strong Black turnout</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tDemocratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats' coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBlack folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They're inspired by the way that he governed himself, said Scott, Virginia's first Black state House speaker.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tObama's campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party's base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats' lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd, Scott's protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats' usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Trump isn't on site but he's in the conversation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tTrump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said without naming Earle-Sears that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThat reflects the tightrope Republicans must walk: Trump remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSpanberger and Sherrill have tried to capitalize.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJack won't say one bad word about the president, Sherrill charged in a debate with Ciattarelli.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCiattarelli countered that no matter who sits in the White House, my job is to stand up for the 9.3 million citizens of the state, and I will. He then played up his Trump ties. It's best to have a relationship with whoever occupies the White House, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEarle-Sears aligns herself with the president, and according to AdImpact data, Spanberger's biggest advertising investment has gone to spots that try to tie Earle-Sears to Trump.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe lieutenant governor will lead GOP turnout rallies Saturday in Republican-rich small towns, first in Abingdon in the southwest corner of Virginia, then in Purceville, in the state's northernmost reaches near the Pennsylvania border.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCiattarelli has stops in Woodbridge, Westfield and Fairfield, an itinerary that puts him in the exurbs of Newark, then across the state in a considerably less densely populated, more Republican swath.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The economy and shutdown overshadow the governor's races</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tSpanberger and Sherrill, both center-left Democrats who helped the party retake the US House in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first term, have emphasized economic arguments.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThey've pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans' federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger has highlighted Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and, to a lesser degree, the ongoing federal shutdown both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the US Census Bureau.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEarle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia's Democratic US senators. Both senators have voted against the GOP's spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state to make the procedure widely accessible. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, trying to frame Spanberger as out of step with mainstream voters in the same way Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>California will have an immediate midterm impact</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact on the national landscape.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tVoters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map that is intended to send five more Democrats to Washington.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's a direct counter to neutralize Texas' plan, already approved, that was drawn to tilt five seats in that state to the Republican column. And more states have followed suit, putting the national map itself in flux in an unprecedented mid-decade scramble years after the usual post-census redistricting process.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House. That means just a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority that, if patterned after his first term, blocks his agenda, opens an investigation of his administration and considers articles of impeachment.</p><p></p></div>",

China's dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives, Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the paper, Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for the US industry, particularly in emerging markets. The forum, he said, focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US stakeholders are concerned about China's growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted that Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy- and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US underinvestment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Atlantic Council warned that these supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption. It noted that China has shown a willingness to weaponise its dominance, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe added that this uncertainty has a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profit, according to Dawn.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",
