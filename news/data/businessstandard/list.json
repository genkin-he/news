US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has advised applicants to take extra care while filling out Form I-485, warning that mistakes or omissions could lead to rejection or long processing delays.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), USCIS said, “Applicants MUST properly complete Form I-485 per the form instructions.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe agency singled out the public charge inadmissibility section in Part 9, noting that some applicants have failed to answer all required questions. “Failure to comply may result in rejection or delays,” it added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is Form I-485</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tForm I-485, officially called the “Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status,” allows eligible individuals already in the United States to apply for a green card. It is the key step in moving from a temporary visa or non-immigrant status to lawful permanent residency.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe form collects personal, background, and financial information. Part of this includes the public charge section, which helps determine whether the applicant is likely to depend on government support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tImmigration experts said errors in this section are common. “Even small mistakes or omissions can cause significant setbacks in processing,” said an immigration attorney familiar with green card applications.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Tips for applicants</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t• Read the instructions carefully before filling out the form</div>\n<div>\r\n\t• Ensure every question, including in Part 9 on public charge, is fully answered</div>\n<div>\r\n\t• Double-check all personal details for accuracy</div>\n<div>\r\n\t• Include all required supporting documents</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t• Review the form before submission to avoid omissions</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Context of wider visa changes</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe guidance comes as the broader immigration system faces upheaval. The Trump administration recently imposed a $100,000 annual fee on new H-1B visa applications. Explaining the move, President Donald Trump said, “The H-1B non-immigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour.”</div></div>",

Margins were driven by pricing, input stability, and lower advertising spends, which the analysts described as “somewhat sustainable.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report said: \"USL’s performance was ahead of our estimates, with revenue/volume growth of 11.5 per cent/7.7 per cent Y-o-Y, aided by the reopening of Andhra Pradesh and steady performance in the P&amp;A segment, partially offset by a decline in Maharashtra. Reported P&amp;A brands’ volume/revenue grew 8.0 per cent/12.4 per cent Y-o-Y, with realisation growth of 4.0 per cent Y-o-Y. Popular segment’s volume/value grew 6.1 per cent/9.0 per cent Y-o-Y, largely driven by the reopening of the AP market.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe analysts expect that in the near term, duty increases in Maharashtra could weigh on performance. Over the long term, however, they see healthy growth supported by structural premiumisation, successful relaunches of legacy brands, and prudent cost management.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tICICI Securities has marginally tweaked its estimates for FY26E/FY27E and introduced FY28 projections. The firm models revenue/Ebitda/PAT CAGR of 10 per cent/13 per cent/11 per cent over FY25–28E, driven by a focus on premiumisation. \"We maintain Add with a revised DCF-based target price of ₹1,550 (previously ₹1,450), as we roll forward to Sep’27 estimates,\" the report said. Key risks include changes in taxation, raw material price volatility, and failure to revive legacy brands.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tNuvama on United Spirits</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama Institutional Equities also maintained its Buy rating on United Spirits following the Q2FY26 results. Analysts noted that the company reported a solid set of numbers, with overall revenue up 12 per cent Y-o-Y and Ebitda up 33 per cent Y-o-Y—ahead of both their and consensus estimates.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report highlighted that strong performance was driven by Andhra Pradesh, coupled with innovation and renovation offerings and a favourable base. Overall volumes grew 7.7 per cent Y-o-Y. P&amp;A sales/volumes increased 12.4 per cent/8 per cent Y-o-Y, while Popular sales/volumes rose 9.2 per cent/6.1 per cent Y-o-Y.

Its request for additional funding sheds light on the difficulties of surviving in India's aviation market, where several carriers have exited after incurring losses. InterGlobe Aviation, which operates IndiGo, is currently the only profitable domestic airline, with over 64 per cent market share.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAir India is jointly owned by Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines. While the Tata Group has a 74.9 per cent stake in the carrier, the remaining is held by Singapore Airlines. The report suggests that any financial aid to the carrier would be proportional to ownership. However, the owners will decide if the funding will take the form of an interest-free loan or equity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAir India's decline</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe carrier's path to profitability had already begun to falter after it was forced to operate longer non-stop west-bound flights from India due to airspace restrictions imposed after India and Pakistan engaged in military confrontations in May. The Indian armed forces launched a pre-emptive, coordinated strike on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Codenamed 'Operation Sindoor', the strikes were in response to the deadly April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe financial position of the carrier worsened further after a Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet bound for London, on June 12, crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad, killing all but one on board.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the wake of the tragedy, India's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), ordered a comprehensive system-wide safety audit. The carrier also reduced its international services operated by widebody jets by 15 per cent between June and August, further denting its revenue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tAir India to incur loss of ₹4,000 cr: CEO</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier this week, Air India's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Campbell Wilson, said that while there are many uncertainties that are affecting the overall travel demand, they cannot derail the carrier.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>Nomura on Swiggy: </strong>Japan-based brokerage firm Nomura has raised its target price on Swiggy to ₹560 from ₹550 earlier while retaining its ‘Buy’ rating, pointing to strong momentum in the company’s food delivery operations, a planned fund-raise to strengthen its quick commerce business, and improving visibility on profitability. The new target implies a potential 34 per cent upside from current levels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating and raise SOTP-based TP marginally to ₹560 (from ₹550 earlier). In our view, disciplined execution and improving visibility on breakeven will be key catalysts for the stock to do well from here,” said Abhishek Bhandari and Karan Nain of Nomura, in a note dated October 31, 2025.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\n<strong><em>Meanwhile, here are the top three reasons behind the target price hike:</em></strong></h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tStrong growth in food delivery business</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwiggy’s food delivery (FD) arm continued its solid performance in the September quarter (Q2FY26), driven by sustained order growth and operational efficiency. The company’s gross order value (GOV) rose 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) and 19 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y), in line with Nomura’s expectations and ahead of Zomato’s 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth in the same period. Monthly transacting users (MTU) climbed 5.7 per cent sequentially to 17.2 million, reflecting improving engagement on the platform.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe take rate, including delivery charges, inched up 10 basis points (bps) Q-o-Q to 25.8 per cent, while contribution margin (CM) remained steady at 7.3 per cent, despite competitive pressures such as lower subscription fees and reduced minimum order values. Adjusted Ebitda margin, as a percentage of GOV, improved 44 basis points Q-o-Q to 2.8 per cent. Nomura highlighted that Swiggy’s difference between GOV and net order value (NOV) growth was only around 0.5 per cent, compared to Zomato’s ~4 per cent gap, suggesting better pricing and volume alignment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura expects Swiggy’s FD segment to maintain its momentum, projecting 19-20 per cent Y-o-Y growth in GOV over FY26–27, with contribution margins expanding modestly to 7.5-7.7 per cent. This sustained growth trajectory, coupled with operational discipline, underpins analysts’ confidence in Swiggy’s long-term value creation potential.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tFund-raising to strengthen quick commerce business</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwiggy’s management has announced plans to raise around ₹10,000 crore to bolster its quick commerce (QC) arm, a segment that continues to face heightened competition. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura noted that the company’s fund-raising efforts are timely, given the dynamic nature of the QC space and peers’ aggressive capital deployment. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRival Zepto recently secured $450 million in new funding, while Zomato’s Blinkit holds about ₹20,000 crore in cash reserves. Strengthening the balance sheet through this capital infusion will boost Swiggy’s ability to invest in growth, logistics, and technology while sustaining its competitive positioning.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tBetter visibility on profitability</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura believes disciplined execution, operational efficiency, and a clearer path toward breakeven are key catalysts for Swiggy’s stock performance in the coming quarters. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage stressed that improving contribution margins and a gradual ramp-up in QC economics provide better visibility on profitability. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Nomura also flagged risks such as intensified competition in the QC business and a potential macroeconomic slowdown that could temper order growth in the online food delivery segment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Alisha Sachdev</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord Motor Co plans to invest about ₹3,250 crore ($370 million) in India to make new engines, a person familiar with the matter said, signaling renewed confidence in the country and defying Donald Trump’s promotion of American manufacturing as it reopens a factory closed four years ago.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Maraimalai Nagar manufacturing site in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu will be retooled to make high-end engines for export markets with an annual capacity of over 200,000 units, said the person, asking not to be named as the plans are private. The engines will not be exported to the US, but it’s unclear which countries they will be sent to, the person said, adding an announcement is expected as early as this week.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US automaker, which first signaled its interest in resuming local production in India a year ago, has been preparing the investment for months against a backdrop of heightened tensions between New Delhi and Washington. Trump placed a 50 per cent tariff on Indian imports earlier this year in a trade standoff, and has lashed out at the Asian country’s purchase of Russian oil. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe move comes even as Trump made boosting manufacturing in the US — especially where the automotive industry is concerned — a signature policy goal. Ford caught flack from the president during his first term for a plan to increase output outside the US, but more recently won praise from him after announcing major investments at its domestic plants. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord declined to comment. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord’s decision reflects renewed confidence in India as a manufacturing base from Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley and comes as it pivots from a previous focus on electric vehicles. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company first set up manufacturing near Chennai in 1995 and added a second plant in Sanand, Gujarat, in 2015. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShortly after becoming CEO in 2020, Farley pulled the plug on a deal with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. that would have kept Ford vehicles on Indian roads. He abandoned the market altogether less than a year later, saying it could no longer pour capital into marginal markets like India and Brazil that provided little or no return. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBy by the time it exited, Ford racked up losses totaling over $2 billion. It ultimately sold off the Sanand vehicle plant to Tata Motors, which now builds EVs there. In 2020, Ford’s chief US rival, General Motors Co, also ceased production in India, three years after shifting to an export-only business model. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMore recently, other US companies have been building up their manufacturing presence in India, despite the political tension. Trump singled out Apple Inc. in May for its decision to manufacture in India, but the tech giant has since ramped up iPhone production across five Indian factories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTamil Nadu, where Ford plans to restart its old facility, is one of India’s largest industrialized states and a longtime automaking hub. It’s home to manufacturing facilities operated by Hyundai Motor Co., Renault SA, and BMW AG.</div></div>",

He explains that in men, subtle symptoms like low energy or mood changes are often missed, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does thyroid disease always cause weight gain?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease always causes weight gain</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Not always. While hypothyroidism (a sluggish thyroid) can slow metabolism and add a few kilos, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) can cause weight loss.

Thyroid medication controls the condition and not cure it. Stopping treatment abruptly can make symptoms worse or cause a hormonal crash. Always speak to your doctor before changing or stopping any thyroid therapy, he advised.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will iodine supplements cure thyroid problems?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Taking iodine supplements cures thyroid problems</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to Dr Majhi, most people already get enough iodine through their diet and <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/salt-myths-fact-check-daily-sodium-health-risks-125100300020_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">iodised salt</a>.

The key is regular hormone checks and medical supervision.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Is it impossible to lose weight with hypothyroidism?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You can’t lose weight if you have hypothyroidism</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Weight loss might be slower, but it is possible. Once thyroid levels are stabilised, a balanced diet, protein intake, and regular exercise work as effectively as they do for anyone else. “Blaming every stubborn kilo on the thyroid is an easy trap,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Are thyroid disorders rare in India?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disorders are rare</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>India is one of the global hotspots for thyroid disease. Recent data suggest that self-reported thyroid disorders among Indians aged 15–49 years rose to 2.9 per cent in 2019–21 (National Family Health Survey-V). Other smaller studies suggest a broader prevalence of 10–12 per cent or higher in adult populations. However, deficits in national biomarker surveys mean the true figure may be higher. Because symptoms often mimic other issues, millions remain undiagnosed, silently dealing with fatigue and mood swings they can’t explain.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will cutting out gluten cure thyroid disease?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Cutting out gluten will cure thyroid disease</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Unless you have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet helps thyroid health. It can help some autoimmune thyroid patients, but for most, it’s unnecessary and nutritionally restrictive.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does a normal TSH mean your thyroid is fine?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>If your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, your thyroid is perfectly fine</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/health-checks-for-mothers-over-40-tests-to-preventive-care-guide-125060900286_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">TSH</a> is just one piece of the puzzle. Dr Majhi says that for a full picture, doctors also look at Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibodies. A normal TSH does not always mean everything is in balance, especially if you are still feeling off.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do thyroid medicines make you dependent?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Once you start medication, you will become dependent</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to the doctors, medicines like Levothyroxine aren’t addictive and simply replace what your body can’t make. It doesn’t fix the root cause, but it keeps your metabolism and hormones stable.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can apple cider vinegar or turmeric cure thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Home remedies like apple cider vinegar or turmeric can fix thyroid issues</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>While these may support general wellness, they can’t balance thyroid hormones. They might help digestion or inflammation, but they’re no match for medical therapy. Use them as lifestyle support, not substitutes.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Should you avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You must avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Quite the opposite! Dr Majhi says exercise actually helps stabilise metabolism, improve mood, and manage weight. Unless your thyroid levels are severely uncontrolled, movement is medicine. Just tailor the intensity under your doctor’s guidance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Majhi stresses that thyroid disorders are common, treatable, and misunderstood. What makes them tricky is how they usually mimic everyday fatigue or stress. That is why periodic screening and trusted medical advice matter more than social media “cures.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The thyroid gland may be small, but its impact on overall health is enormous. Understanding the facts and not falling for myths is the first step towards control,” he says.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div></div><div><blockquote class=\"blockquoteBG styleQ1\" style=\"background-color:#FFF5EB;padding:8px;overflow:hidden\">\n<p>\n<strong>About Fact-Check Friday</strong></p>\n<p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tMisinformation in health can be more harmful than the illness itself.

Nuvama has reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating, raising the sum-of-the-parts (SOTP)-based target price to ₹413 (from ₹401 earlier).</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“NTPC remains our top pick in Power Utilities given a likely 6% EPS CAGR over FY25–27E coupled with 17 per cent core RoE (~22GW capex—50:50 thermal/hydro cum RE) while still trading at an inexpensive 1.5x FY27E P/BV. Retain ‘Buy’ with an SotP-based TP of ₹413 (earlier ₹401), at 2.5x FY27E SA book + NTPC Green at a 30 per cent discount to CMP (₹105),” said Subhadip Mitra, Vikram Datwani, Mahir Moondra and Divyam Sureka of Nuvama, in a note dated October 30, 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tSteady quarterly performance</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor the September quarter of FY26 (Q2FY26), NTPC’s standalone adjusted profit after tax (PAT) rose 7.5 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to around ₹4,500 crore, driven primarily by a sharp 66 per cent jump in other income and lower interest expenses, which are passed through in regulated tariffs. Operating performance was largely in line, though weak power demand led to a dip in plant load factor (PLF) to 66 per cent versus 72.3 per cent a year ago. This weighed on core RoE, which slipped to 14.4 per cent from 15.8 per cent Y-o-Y despite a 6 per cent rise in regulated equity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn a consolidated basis, profit remained flat Y-o-Y at ₹5,230 crore as lower dividends from subsidiaries and joint ventures offset a notable improvement in subsidiary-level profits (₹1,150 crore vs ₹840 crore last year). Management guided that fixed cost under-recovery, which stood at ₹625 crore in the first half, should decline to ₹250 crore by Q4FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tExpansion momentum intact</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNTPC’s group generation declined around 6 per cent Y-o-Y during the quarter due to subdued demand. However, capacity expansion remains on track with 33GW under construction (17.3GW thermal, 2.2GW hydro, and the rest renewable). The company has revised its commissioning guidance to 9.2GW for FY26 (2.8GW thermal, 1GW hydro, 5.4GW renewables) and about 10.5GW for FY27. Most upcoming projects are housed under subsidiaries or joint ventures, suggesting that consolidated earnings will capture most of the future growth. NTPC targets over 60GW of operational renewable capacity by FY32, up from 7.4GW as of September 2025. The company also declared an interim dividend of ₹2.75 per share for Q2FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tForay into nuclear, storage</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNTPC is expanding into nuclear power through its Ashvini JV with NPCIL, which is developing the 4×700MW Mahi Banswara project in Rajasthan. The foundation stone was laid in September 2025, with additional sites identified through state MoUs. The company’s pumped storage portfolio stands at 21.2GW, including 11GW directly under NTPC and 10.4GW through THDC and NEEPCO.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, NTPC has been allocated a 5,000MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) under the viability gap funding scheme to enhance thermal plant efficiency and ensure power supply during non-solar hours. The project, spread across 14 stations, will help optimise asset utilisation and reduce costs.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith a diversified expansion strategy, improving operational mix, and attractive valuations, NTPC remains Nuvama’s preferred bet in India’s power utilities space.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
