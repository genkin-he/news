Before that, some of the finest Indian judges came from a system in which the executive had, in theory, complete freedom to appoint judges,\" the former solicitor general said.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral \"fiercely independent judges\" were appointed by the government of the day, he said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"But then things started going wrong. We fixed it, and I was part of the legal system which fought to take away this power from the executive, but it was a band-aid. It was not a solution. And in hindsight, I think it is about time we correct the folly we made,\" the senior advocate said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSalve said India was the only country which had changed governments with the ballot, and not the bullet and that showed the success of the Constitution and the democracy.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe lawyer, however, there are still challenges which lie ahead, and there is a need for judicial reforms and restoring the independence of the civil service.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe underlined the need for \"coequal institutions\", like Parliament and the Election Commission, to be respected, and said that he was \"distressed\" to see the EC officials summoned by the apex court.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We must always remember that Parliament is a coequal institution. The Election Commission is a coequal institution. In recent times, I was distressed to see the way the Supreme Court summons the Election Commission and talks rudely towards officers,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Of course, you (Supreme Court) have the power of judicial review if you find something wrong. (But) Do not disrespect them.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"What happens when you call them (co-equal institutions) to account on the basis of a false set of facts presented to you, you let the person who has disrespected a coequal institution say, 'Oh, naughty boy, go away from here. Do not do it again.' Would you have taken the same soft approach if somebody had done the same to you as an institution? You are a high office, and double standards do not go together,\" Salve said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe cited the example of the United Kingdom's judicial reforms, where the judges were appointed by the judicial panel selected by the judicial commission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"And I am always challenged as to, well, if you have this (a judicial appointment commission), who is going to select (members of) the commission? And my answer is, if as 1.4 billion Indians, we can't find seven honest people to appoint judges, shame on us and calling us a democracy,\" Salve said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Why cannot the four or five big functionaries, the speakers of Parliament, the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister of India, members of the opposition, senior members of the opposition, constitute a panel. Who will select a panel? Can't we find seven independent Indians out of 1.4 billion, and leave it to them to select judges on merit?\" he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe process of judicial appointment must be transparent, Salve said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"How is it a transparent process? Not by saying you must publish what you discuss in that little Collegium of yours and destroy reputations of your own and those of those whom you select and do not select. But in the UK, for example, it is by invitation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"So, whenever there is a vacancy, you advertise you receive. What you have received is in the public domain. How you select is not, because that then becomes a criticism of why you have not chosen. One over the other. This is one of the biggest challenges to our judiciary,\" the lawyer, who represented India at the International Court of Justice at the Hague in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the overreach of the judiciary, the senior advocate said, \"Judicial nudges are good. Do not let it become a judicial sledgehammer.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Salve said he was worried about the judiciary's \"control\" over the elected executive under the veil of accountability, by entertaining ill-conceived public interest litigations against people in public life, devastating their careers.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"That is not what the Supreme Court was meant for. It was not meant to do a magistrate's job to oversee investigations,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSalve said the 1975 Emergency was the only time in the history of India when the rule of law was \"seriously threatened.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> He said that the day the citizenry developed apathy, it created a crisis, a kind that he said he has been witnessing in the current Europe.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Europe today is going through a crisis because I have seen the generation of a successful, hard-working post-World War II generation who built Europe into a powerhouse, give way to a generation which was well-fed, well-nurtured and without a fire in their belly. Europe has to reinvent itself. We in India are much ahead in the race,\" Salve said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe asked the students to embrace globalisation as it would open opportunities to conquer the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I have faith in Indians. I have faith in your minds. I have the privilege of working in so many jurisdictions, and I dare say, and yes, of course, I am biased in favour of India, but I say India has amongst the finest minds,\" Salve said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

The Y-o-Y decline in margin was attributed to increased investments in training and audits, user acquisition, faster fulfilment, customer support, and team expansion, aimed at positioning the business for long-term sustainable growth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Native business recorded strong momentum, with NTV rising 164 per cent  Y-o-Y to ₹97 crore, led by significant growth in water purifiers and electronic door locks portfolios.

Within just eight months of the launch, Insta Help scaled rapidly to 468,000 orders in October, despite limited geographic coverage. Customer retention and repeat usage have been strong, though steady-state behaviour is expected to evolve over time. Insta Help reported an adjusted Ebitda loss of ₹44 crore in Q2FY26, reflecting early-phase investments in supply onboarding, training, and network densification.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹2,136 crore, providing a strong foundation for continued investment and growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to practice genuine multilateralism, according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xi, Lee discuss North Korea</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tChinese state media reports on the Xi-Lee meeting didn't immediately carry any North Korea-related comments by Xi.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Wi Sung-lac, Lee's national security director, said Lee during the meeting outlined his strategy for achieving denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and requested a constructive Chinese role to help realise the resumption of talks with North Korea.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tXi replied that he would continue his efforts to help resolve issues involving the Korean Peninsula and promote peace and stability here, Wi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina is North Korea's traditional ally and economic pipeline, but there are still questions about how much leverage it has on its impoverished neighbour. China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing UN sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against US influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about its daydream of realising North Korea's denuclearisation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea, said earlier Saturday he would take more active preemptive steps to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said South Korea and China also signed several agreements on jointly combating online scams, expanding a bilateral free trade deal and renewing a currency swap deal that expired last month.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders call for greater cooperation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAfter two days of talks, APEC leaders vowed greater cooperation to tackle shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by rising protectionism and trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir joint statement declared that the APEC leaders \"acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenges.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, it says.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea's National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting free and open trade, which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC's mission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It wasn't possible to leave that out entirely, said Min.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe joint declaration also said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that's free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile the summit's opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday's meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAPEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, ageing populations and accelerated urbanisation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that investing in China is investing in the future.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEstablished in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration.
