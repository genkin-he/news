            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to make India’s tax system more trust-based, simpler, and technology-driven in the Union Budget 2026-27, with a focus on faster dispute resolution and easier Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rules. “India’s next leap requires a principle-based, technology-enabled, and trust-anchored tax system,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said after the industry body met the revenue secretary on Thursday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCII noted that tax litigation continues to burden businesses, with more than five lakh appeals involving nearly ₹18 lakh crore pending before the commissioner (appeals). It asked the government to fast-track cases involving more than ₹100 crore and resolve them within one year through virtual hearings and close monitoring by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Penalty proceedings should be paused till the main appeal is settled, and draft orders should be shared for factual checks before being finalised, it suggested. CII also sought revival of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) under retired high court judges, “empowered to deliver binding rulings within six months”.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build taxpayer confidence, CII called for converting the existing taxpayer charter into a legal Taxpayer Rights Charter guaranteeing time-bound refunds, faceless assessments, and accountability for administrative delays. It also flagged issues in the Central Processing Centre (CPC) system for return processing and asked for “improved protocols ensuring that only apparent mistakes are adjusted automatically and that taxpayers can request virtual hearings when required”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn direct tax simplification, CII said the TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework — with more than 35 categories and multiple rates — has become too complex and affects business liquidity. It recommended reducing the framework to two or three broad rates, exempting transactions between Goods and Services Tax (GST)-registered entities, and clarifying that no TDS should apply to the GST portion of a payment. “Tax simplification is not a concession; it is an investment in governance efficiency,” Banerjee said. “When rules are clear and systems are digital, compliance becomes automatic and disputes become exceptional.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn indirect taxes and customs, CII pitched a one-time settlement scheme for old disputes, longer validity for advance rulings, and full digital processing of customs through Application Programming Interface (API)-based systems. It suggested a roadmap for “paper-free customs by 2028” with e-refunds, e-adjudication, and e-appeals. CII also called for rationalising tariffs by consolidating exemption notifications and permitting a single appeal for multiple bills of entry (BoE) where issues are common, along with automatic release of bonds once export obligations are met.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo improve predictability, CII suggested a multi-year corporate tax roadmap and removal of prosecution for minor and unintentional errors under both direct and indirect tax laws. “CII’s proposals are not about cutting taxes, but they are about cutting friction,” Banerjee said, adding that a trust-based compliance system can boost revenues without hurting the exchequer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India has already shown the world that large-scale reforms like GST 2.0 can succeed,” he said. “If we now make our tax systems as simple and predictable as they are digital and fair, we will not only raise revenues more efficiently but also build the foundations of an economy that inspires confidence — both at home and abroad.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

There is no problem of capital availability. Both banks and corporates are doing very well; their balance sheets are in good shape,” he said. Dev also pointed out that uncertainty remains a challenge for private sector investment despite improving macro indicators.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDev emphasised that exports and investment remain the key growth drivers, while multiple government stimulus measures and monetary easing are expected to spur further private investment. “Multiple stimulus measures by the government, coupled with a reduction in interest rates, will lead to further private investment,” he said, noting a revival of private capex in technology sectors such as data centres, electronics, and renewables.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn manufacturing, Dev explained that while the sector’s share in GDP might appear stagnant, its output had risen sharply — by 75 per cent between FY15 and FY25. “It’s not stagnant; services have simply grown faster,” he said. He added that employment elasticity in manufacturing had turned positive after the pandemic, reflecting renewed strength.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDrawing attention to regional disparities, Dev called for strengthening cooperative federalism to ensure balanced development. “The experience of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council shows that cooperative federalism works,” he said, urging expansion of cooperative federalism beyond GST to cover development and fiscal matters to accelerate inclusive growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDev highlighted India’s federal structure and noted that many states had announced ambitious targets for 2047, with Telangana aiming to become a $3-trillion economy. “States play an important role, but decentralisation stops with them; we also have to decentralise to panchayats and municipal councils,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStressing the importance of inclusion, Dev described quality employment as the “most important component of inclusive growth.” He underscored the need to boost women’s labour force participation and improve employability in both rural and urban areas. He also urged preparation for green industrialisation, noting that climate action and net-zero transitions must involve state- and district-level planning.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe highlighted new opportunities across traditional manufacturing, modern industries, and global value chains, and underscored the importance of rare earth production and technology sectors for India’s long-term competitiveness.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Viksit Bharat is not just about achieving growth. It must also be inclusive and sustainable,” Dev said, adding that India’s long-term success depends on moving towards a labour-intensive, high-growth manufacturing model and a society that is prosperous, inclusive, and pro-nature.</div></div>",

Sebi covers a vast area. These are very niche which requires depth,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tChallenge of interpreting feedback</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan outlined the two key mistakes regulators often face. “A type 1 error is when we let bad things happen, regulators hate it. The type 2 error is when, in our zeal to prevent type 1, we come out with a 10,000-page circular that makes life tough for practitioners,” he said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that Sebi consults widely through advisory committees and industry forums, but the challenge lies in interpreting that feedback. “Not every stakeholder is adequately represented, and there are natural conflicts of interest. You need expertise at the deciding level to minimise both type 1 and type 2 errors,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tBalance between policy design and market experience<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></h3>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan argued that the quality of regulatory outcomes depends on this balance between policy design and market experience. “You have smart people at the policy and regulatory level, but you can’t become an expert just by being a smart person,” he said. “You also need checks and balances to prevent conflicts of interest. If we have a good ecosystem to manage it, that’s our best bet to minimise errors.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReferring to Sebi’s ongoing focus on the derivatives market, he said data had shown that retail investors are facing heavy losses. “Total losses by retail traders in futures and options in FY25 were ₹1 trillion,” he said. “The volume of trade, particularly on index expiry days, is simply not sustainable.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNarayan added that the regulator’s intent was to strike a balance without being overly interventionist. “Our intent is to manage three risks: retail losses, instability in the market, and the quality of the derivative curve, without playing god in the derivatives market,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCaution on valuations and liquidity<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></h3>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the issue of valuations and market liquidity, Narayan cautioned that exuberance in equities required vigilance. “In FY25, the net demand for equities through mutual funds was ₹6.25 trillion. Including other domestic institutional investors and individuals, the total demand was ₹8.8 trillion, equivalent to $100 billion. The net supply was ₹4.6 trillion.
