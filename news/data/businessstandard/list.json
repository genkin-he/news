            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tInvestors should keep expectations realistic, stay invested with discipline, and focus on asset allocation as markets move through a more measured phase, chief investment officers (CIOs) of leading fund houses said in a panel discussion at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, said India’s overall position remains stable, supported by sound macroeconomic factors. “India is in a better shape than a year ago,” he said during a panel discussion moderated by Samie Modak</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have been telling investors to follow asset allocation, but we are now slightly more positive on equities than last year. We are in a moderate return situation but better than last year.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSailesh Raj Bhan, Chief Investment Officer – Equity, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said investors’ return expectations have not changed much despite recent market behaviour. “When we meet people, we realise return expectations haven’t shifted down,” he said. “Something or the other keeps working in different markets, so investors continue to look for quick gains.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said markets have become more balanced, with large caps delivering earnings-led performance. “Expectations should be moderate and aligned with earnings growth,” Bhan said. “The large-cap space is becoming more sensible, but this is not a period for very high returns.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMahesh Patil, CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, said that while valuations have eased from earlier highs, the recovery ahead will likely be gradual. “A year ago, valuations were at a premium, and growth had slowed. Now liquidity conditions are easier, and valuations are more reasonable,” he said. “With growth expected to improve, the outlook looks better than it did last year.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRajeev Thakkar, CIO, PPFAS Mutual Fund, said investors should stay focused on their investment plans and avoid expecting unusually high returns. “The past year has seen limited movement in stock prices, though earnings have grown modestly,” he said. “There are still pockets where valuations are elevated. Equities can do better than fixed income over time, but expectations should remain realistic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom the debt market perspective, Rajeev Radhakrishnan, CIO – Fixed Income, SBI Mutual Fund, said the backdrop has turned favourable. “Debt valuations look more comfortable,” he said. “Inflation is not a concern, and liquidity conditions are supportive.” He added that while some policy easing may continue, most of it has already taken place.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRadhakrishnan said hybrid and asset allocation products are likely to attract more investor interest. “Flows into short-term fixed income funds have been limited,” he said. “Given the current tax framework, allocations to debt are increasingly coming through hybrid products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeveral fund managers said a balanced investment mix helps investors handle periods of uncertainty. Naren said his fund house has been recommending hybrid and multi-asset products for the past two years. “These products help investors maintain balance during market corrections,” he said. “We have closed some small- and mid-cap funds for new subscriptions to avoid concentration risk.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBhan said maintaining clear communication with investors is also important. “Our focus is on explaining the kind of risk being taken,” he said. “We encourage investors to commit money they will not need for at least five to seven years, and to invest through systematic investment plans. Asset allocation helps manage risk better.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPatil said strong inflows can make deployment more complex in certain market segments. “When large amounts come into specific categories such as small caps, it becomes difficult to invest without affecting valuations,” he said. “We manage this by spreading investments across a wider number of stocks.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThakkar said his fund avoids being fully invested at all times if suitable opportunities are not available. “We prefer to deploy when we find reasonable valuations,” he said. “If we don’t, we wait. It’s better to stay patient than to force deployment.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn new listings, Bhan said funds need to be selective. “In any strong market, supply increases,” he said. “Our focus is on buying the right business at the right price. If that does not fit, we stay away.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNaren said that large inflows into equities shift the responsibility of allocation directly to investors. “In this cycle, most capital is being allocated through mutual funds and similar products, not banks,” he said. “If allocation goes wrong, the investor bears the risk. Many believe equities are risk-free, but that is not the case.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAcross equity and debt, the panellists emphasised discipline, diversification, and a focus on long-term goals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Investing is not arithmetic,” Naren said. “No one can predict markets, but maintaining asset allocation and a diversified approach helps investors have a steadier experience.”</div></div>",

Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, one of the smaller state-owned entities, said it paused all buying for now, citing the risk of secondary sanctions. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint venture between tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s Mittal Energy and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd, suspended further deals.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tCombined, the three accounted for about 920,000 barrels a day of Russian crude imports in the first half of the year — or 52 percent of India’s total, according to data from analytics firm Kpler. That will now likely fall to zero, though the figure could change over time as other factors, including sanctions enforcement and the evolution of India’s trade talks with the US, become clearer.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRefiners are moving to fill the gap left by Moscow.

So, putting a target of ₹100 trillion assets under management (AUM) is anybody’s guess — it will happen sooner than later,” Singh said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNavneet Munot, managing director (MD) and CEO of HDFC Mutual Fund, said India’s MF journey has been built on strong foundations but needs to go further in building investor confidence.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We take pride in being one of the most transparent industries in the world,” he said, adding: “The growth so far has come on the back of four Ts — track record, transparency, technology and training. Now we must build the fifth T, which is trust.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the industry’s assets are less than one-fifth of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), compared with over 80 per cent in the US, Munot said that only underlines the scope ahead. “Every time we have projected a number for the industry, it has done better. The long-term story remains intact,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MF industry has had a strong run in recent years, with SIP accounts growing more than three-fold in five years from about 30 million in 2020 to nearly 97 million now. Yet the average monthly contribution has inched up only modestly.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The average SIP size has moved from ₹2,300 in 2021 to about ₹3,200. If that goes up to even ₹5,000 over the next few years, it can make a huge difference to overall wealth creation,” Singh said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tB Gopkumar, MD&amp;CEO of Axis MF, said that even with such growth, India’s investor base remains small.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have only around 56 million unique investors. The headroom for expansion is huge. Digital is the new Bharat — onboarding and KYC (know your customer) are much simpler, and fintech platforms are bringing in a new set of first-time investors,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Gopkumar cautioned that fintechs will need to focus more on investor education. “Many of them are great at customer acquisition but not at building stickiness. We need to ensure that SIPs last longer and investors stay invested through market cycles,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor Vetri Subramaniam, CEO-designate of UTI Asset Management Company, the next phase of growth will come from broadening the base and improving investor discipline. “We have to reach more people with smaller ticket sizes and ensure they stay invested long enough to benefit from compounding,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSubramaniam said the industry must also focus on the underdeveloped debt fund space. “The equity side has grown rapidly, but the debt market remains underrepresented. That’s a large untapped opportunity,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestor behaviour, the panel agreed, has improved significantly. “Any fall in the market is now seen as an opportunity. Retail investors have shown remarkable maturity, and the industry has become more resilient,” Singh said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMunot said the steady rise in SIP flows despite volatility is a sign of that change. “Our SIP book has grown from ₹4,000 crore in 2017 to about ₹29,000 crore now, across several market phases. It shows how resilient Indian investors have become,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe next leg of expansion can also come from product innovation, panellists said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Gopkumar, the recently introduced specialised investment fund (SIF) gives AMCs a chance to create more flexible and customised offerings. “SIFs will be a large category and can attract investors who want personalised solutions,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSingh, whose firm was among the first to launch an SIF, said early trends are encouraging. “About 30 per cent of investors in our SIF are new to mutual funds. Many came through digital channels, which shows how innovation can expand reach,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor new entrants such as Sid Swaminathan, MD&amp;CEO of Jio BlackRock AMC, the data itself makes the opportunity obvious.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have entered this space because the potential is immense. In the last five years, assets have tripled and investors have almost tripled. Even if growth slows and we just double from here, the scale will be huge,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwaminathan said the digital ecosystem will play a central role in that journey. “About 10 per cent of our 750,000 investors are completely new to mutual funds, and nearly 40 per cent of our flows come from beyond the top 30 cities. Artificial intelligence (AI) and regional-language content will make it easier to educate and engage investors everywhere,” Swaminathan said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also expects passive investing to gain further traction. “It is not active or passive — it’s active and passive. India’s passive fund share is about 18 per cent compared with over 50 per cent in the US, so there’s plenty of room to grow,” Swaminathan said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMunot added that both approaches will co-exist. “We want to be a one-stop wealth-creation platform. Whether investors prefer active or passive, the focus is on meeting their financial goals,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite their different perspectives, the five executives agreed on what will drive the industry from here — inclusion, investor education, and transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The more open we are about what we charge and how we perform, the more trust we build. That trust will define the next phase of growth for mutual funds in India,” Gopkumar said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tEquity investors will need to rely on sound stock-picking and patience to generate superior returns in the coming years, said market experts at <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit in Mumbai.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe experts spoke at a panel discussion titled ‘Where Are The Market Opportunities — Where Should Investors Allocate?’ moderated by <em>Sundar Sethuraman</em> of <em>Business Standard</em>.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are at a stage where stock-picking becomes important. It’s very much a bottom-up market. The easy money that existed earlier is no longer available. Investors must remember that equities are a long-term asset class — requiring discipline, conviction, and a focus on fundamentals,” said Pramod Gubbi, cofounder of Marcellus Investment Managers.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the moderate equity returns seen this year, panellists noted that the market is merely adjusting after years of excessive post-pandemic gains.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We had four years of exuberance post-pandemic and are now witnessing a return to normalcy. But valuations still remain above historical averages. Between caution and optimism, it’s fair to say investors need to be cautiously optimistic. The core of equity investing is risk management — there are no obvious themes to play right now. Returns and earnings growth have both been in single digits, and valuations have time-corrected. Yet, markets are not exactly screaming buys either,” Gubbi said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManish Gunwani, head of equities at Bandhan Asset Management Company, said investors should maintain a long-term view rather than fixate on near-term valuations. “Over the long term, equities tend to deliver 5-7 per cent above inflation. Over a 10- to 20-year period, that translates into roughly 6.5-7 per cent. So investors need to be neither greedy nor fearful. While valuations may not be cheap currently, global government debt is at record highs — often a precursor to easier monetary policy. On a three- to five-year horizon, double-digit equity returns remain my base case,” Gunwani said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe experts observed that several positive policy measures — including higher income tax limits in the last Union Budget, rationalisation of the goods and services tax, and recent rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India — have created a supportive environment for an economic and earnings recovery.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve had enough policy measures introduced. Large parts of the economy should begin to pick up. Although earnings growth has been patchy lately, it is likely to improve. Earnings estimates for the next two years may settle at mid-single digits after some revisions, still suggesting healthy equity returns compared to other asset classes,” said Gaurav Misra, head of equity at Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHari Shyamsunder, vice-president and senior client portfolio manager — emerging markets equity (India), Franklin Templeton, said the extent of disappointment in earnings was narrowing as catalysts for recovery gain traction. “Fiscal and monetary policy support has been tremendous, setting the stage for a strong rebound next financial year. Current earnings estimates are healthy. Even if we see some downward revisions, they may be limited this time, setting the market up well for the year ahead,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGubbi added that the market appears to be near the bottom of its earnings downgrade cycle. “For six to seven quarters now, companies have consistently fallen short of analyst expectations, leading to earnings downgrades. This could be the first quarter where we see fewer downgrades. While earnings growth hasn’t improved dramatically, expectations have been reset lower. Looking to 2026-27, mid-teens earnings growth appears achievable. Markets move on expectations. With expectations beaten down, there’s room for positivity,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe further said that consumption-focused policy measures were well-timed, coinciding with the improvement in household balance sheets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked how reform measures would impact the equity markets, Misra said investors must identify companies that can leverage these reforms to enhance profitability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve seen some signs of improvement on the discretionary side, especially in automobile sales. When you add up the direct and indirect tax breaks, households will have more disposable income, and residential equated monthly instalments will become more affordable as rates come down. The India opportunity is structural and decadal, and it will be spread across market capitalisations. There will be winners across the board,” said Misra.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tArtificial intelligence, or AI, has had an influence in the way we invest in stocks. While it helps you narrow the list of opportunities, it has not reached a point where it can replace wealth managers, points out <strong>Shankar Sharma</strong>, founder, GQuants, in a fireside chat with <strong>A K Bhattacharya</strong>.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>To what extent is your investment philosophy data- and AI-driven?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMy needle of investing has moved from being very traditional to becoming 80-90 per cent data- and AI- driven. That has been my transformation as an investor.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, I was an early adopter of AI and quant-driven thinking. And again, to clarify, it’s not that I use only AI but where it comes into play. It is giving me a breadth and scale of opportunity seeking, which I would not be able to do humanly, or even with a team.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, in a sea of 10,000 companies, for example, how do you find five, 10, 15, or 20 good ones? AI is giving me that today. Now, after that, the human part of me kicks in to further refine it down to the best five, or the best eight, or the best 10. But getting to that, it was a needle in a haystack. Now, the haystack has become much easier for me to understand. That's how I am using AI. Thus, my investment philosophy is simply that instead of taking a small number of large bets, as I would when I was a human being, because of AI, I can take a large number of small bets and a small number of large bets simultaneously.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will AI replace humans in investing or in financial services?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think it will not happen because we human beings will prevent AI from becoming that important because it will take away our jobs. For example, if a mutual fund chief investment officer gets too much AI into his firm, tomorrow his job is in danger.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAI will have a natural check because of our vested interests and balance embedded in it. It will have a role, but to expect that everything will go from human beings and go to AI … I don't think that will happen.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You are perceived as a contrarian. Will that change with the advent of AI?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI don’t think AI will change who you intrinsically are. But here is where the danger lies and I am mindful of that. And I try to limit the use of AI in my day-to-day life.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter using AI tools in the past one or two years, I have realised that for getting perspectives or getting data, I find you can but it (AI) will learn what you want the answer to be. So, on a topic it will start giving you answers that it senses you want.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt reads your mind on that topic and then starts feeding you answers that support your thesis. This is exactly what you don't want when you are trying to think differently and be a contrarian.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>We have not been able to get that right mix of AI and our intelligence to help navigate this difficult, complex world. How should the financial sector use AI?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAI is too new for us to form conclusions on whether it will reshape financial services in a big way. I mean, computers came and they reshaped it. AI will also reshape it. How much we have no idea, nobody can tell.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhat I do know is that AI is reshaping itself. Even AI doesn’t know where it will go five years from now. There are many flaws in it. It gives you wrong information and sometimes fabricates it. This destroys confidence.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhy were we looking at AI? Because it is better than a human in giving me correct data. But I find it gives me rubbish most of the time. So, now the process I follow is I check the same information on four different platforms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think it is imperfect right now. In fact, vastly imperfect. In some cases, dangerously imperfect.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>In addition to how one should deal with AI, what are the other things investors should bear in mind?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReturns in global markets this year have been off the charts. It’s been one of the best years of my life as an investor because I invest globally. And I have been spoilt for choice this year, which is, on a policy basis, supposedly the most tumultuous year. So, clearly there is something markets are reading and I think markets are reading it right.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier, in investing, America was the only game in town. If you missed the American bull market, you were pretty much dead. Today, that’s not the case.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI am happy that America is slowing a bit because of its policies. The rest of the world is restructuring, reshaping. It is opening up more opportunities for me as an investor.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI do not see that as a negative at all. If anything, it is better from a portfolio management standpoint to have 15-20 good markets rather than have just one.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Any other learning from this world of uncertainty?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think the biggest uncertainty for an investor today should be the fact that if you (the investor) are exposed only to a single market and that market for whatever reason might have a very uncertain situation, you then have a genuine problem. Therefore, diversify your investment beyond just the comfort zone. Fortunately, tools, including AI, are available to help you do that.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The Indian economy is still predominantly dependent on oil import. What’s your view on how oil will impact the Indian financial sector, Indian stocks, and Indian markets?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExploration can reshape our oil and gas situation over the long term. In the interim, I don't think it’s in anybody’s interests, not even producers’, to have high oil prices. I think there is a consensus in the producing world that this is a good, happy price that generally keeps the world satisfied. We love bull markets in equities, gold, silver, and real estate. What is the bull market we hate? A bull market in oil. Only seven or 10 countries love it. But even at $60, I think they are pretty well prepared.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What are the reasons for the bull market in gold and silver and your advice for investors?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe can attribute and ascribe reasons to the bull market in gold. But as regards silver, I don’t think there are good reasons. Now people say that it is for industrial use. But that has always been the case. Gold is in a good place right now. But I am not saying the reason for that is people are de-dollarising and moving away. I think the opposite is true.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs gold is going up, people are moving from the dollar to gold. It’s not the other way around. That’s my view.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOther than oil, I am generally bullish on commodities. And I think there are plenty of reasons. But the reasons will change at some point in time. So, I am not a big believer in making long-term forecasts on commodities.</div></div>",
