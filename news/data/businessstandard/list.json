According to IQVIA, around 118 biologics worth $232 billion are set to lose patent protection between 2025 and 2034.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKey beneficiaries include Biocon, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma, and Lupin, with Biocon particularly well placed due to its fully integrated biosimilar capabilities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama analysts estimate that if finalised, the new framework could reduce development timelines from 8–9 years to as little as 4–5 years, materially lowering costs and enabling quicker product launches.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Indian industry welcomes FDA reforms</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), said the new guidelines will simplify interchangeability rules and open new pathways for Indian firms to expand into the large-molecule biologics space.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India already has nearly 130 approved biosimilars, and over the next seven years, more than 55 blockbuster drugs are expected to lose exclusivity in the US,” Jain said. “These reforms will strengthen the US–India partnership in improving healthcare access and affordability.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A $100-billion opportunity</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US biologics market, estimated at around $100 billion, remains the largest in the world. With the FDA’s draft guidance now open for industry discussion, analysts expect heightened investments and faster market entry by Indian players.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf finalised, the guidelines could position India as a key global hub for biosimilar innovation — much like it became for generic pharmaceuticals two decades ago.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The newly appointed Fed governor, Stephen Miran, dissented once again as he called for a 50-bps cut, while Jeffery Schmid, the Kansas Fed President, dissented against the rate cut, which was a hawkish surprise. The Fed said that it will end the asset runoff (reduction of its securities holdings) beginning on December 1. The Fed Chair Powell warned in his presser that the December rate cut was not a done deal as the Fed faces a lack of data due to the ongoing US government partial shutdown.  Hawkish FOMC decision weighed on commodities as the US Dollar Index and yields shot up.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn October 29, the Central Bank of Canada cut its interest rate by 25 bps to 2.25 per cent amid tariff wars, though it signalled that its borrowing costs have reached the right level as long as its forecasts hold good.</div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn yet another key decision, as expected, on October 30, the European Central Bank left key interest rates unchanged for a third meeting as inflation is around the Bank's goal of 2 per cent and the economy continues to grow. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Euro area economy grew 0.2 per cent (forecast 0.1 per cent) on a Q-o-Q basis in Q3.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tUS Dollar and yields</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US Dollar Index, boosted by hawkish FOMC rate cut, gained nearly 0.5 per cent on October 29.

Currently only City sedan has variants featuring the hybrid technology.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe company will have products with multiple powertrains including ICE, hybrid and full electric to cater to varied set of customer requirements in India, it stated.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen asked about market share aspirations, Nakajima said that efforts to streamline the model range in the country has impacted the company's volume and now the focus would be to make Honda stronger in the Indian market.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India has seen its market share dip considerably over the last few years amidst enhanced competition.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAbout expanding production capacity at Tapukara plant in Rajasthan and also possibility of utilising the Greater Noida plant, he noted that nothing is finalised as yet but the automaker is considering various \"options flexibly\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2023, Honda Cars India formally announced closure of manufacturing operations at its Greater Noida facility in Uttar Pradesh.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe automaker said the decision to cease production at the plant, which came up in 1997, has been taken as part of realignment of manufacturing operations with the goal of improving business efficiency.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWith the closure of the Greater Noida facility, HCIL also discontinued CR-V and Civic models in the country. Both the models were being manufactured at the plant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Greater Noida plant had an installed production capacity of one lakh units per annum. On the other hand, Tapukara facility can roll out 1.8 lakh units per year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tReplying to a query on the deployment of flex fuel technologies in its product range, Mibe said Honda has been offering flex fuel vehicles in the Brazilian market for many years and if required can introduce it in India as well.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India registered a cumulative growth of 20 per cent in its total sales with 1,31,871 units sold during calendar year 2024.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDomestic sales of the company stood at 68,650 units and exports at 63,221 units last year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe maker of City and Amaze sedans and Elevate midsize SUV sold a total of 1,10,143 units in 2023 with domestic volume of 84,289 units.</p><p></p></div>",

Through shadow fleets, third-country intermediaries, and non-dollar trades, Russia is likely to maintain 80–90 per cent of its export volumes, mitigating impacts on Rosneft (3.5 million bpd, 40 per cent of Russia's production) and Lukoil (0.9 million bpd, 10 per cent share).<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile sanctions have reduced revenues by over 20 per cent to $297 billion in 2024 and exports by 20 per cent since 2022, they fail to cripple the sector due to Europe's dependency, Russia's adaptability, and enforcement gaps, keeping oil under pressure. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tLatest sanction impact</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRosneft and Lukoil are blocked from US financial systems, complicating dollar trades and shipping, potentially disrupting 1–1.5 million bpd short-term. This could shift the market from a 0.5 million bpd surplus to a deficit by 2026, with a 1 million bpd swing roughly pushing prices $6–$7/bbl higher.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tIndia and China avoid russian oil</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia and China, absorbing 3.7 million bpd (25 per cent of Russia's exports), face challenges, with Indian refiners pausing shipments and China suspending new seaborne purchases, redirecting to Middle East/US sources. India's state refiners cut Russian buys by 45 per cent in Q3, maintaining volumes at 1.7 mb/d (34 per cent share).</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tUS &amp; OPEC+ keeping market in surplus</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tUS output hit a record 13.642 million bpd in the week ending October 24, 2025, up 0.1 per cent w-o-w and 5.4 per cent y-o-y, with the Permian Basin at 6.6 million bpd (48 per cent of US total). EIA forecasts 13.53 million bpd for 2025 (+2 per cent y-o-y) and 13.51 million bpd in 2026, leading non-OPEC growth of 1.6 million bpd in 2025 and 1.2 million bpd in 2026, outpacing demand at 740,000 bpd. OPEC+ is expected to add 137,000 bpd from December, bringing total restoration to 2.85 million bpd from April onward. a negative development for long term price outlook.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMacro development</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US-China trade agreement is a tactical pause, extending the 90-day truce beyond November 10 without resolving core issues like intellectual property, technology transfers, and structural reforms. While the US suspended broader software export curbs on laptops and jet engines, reducing tariffs to 47 per cent on Chinese goods and 30 per cent on US imports, this limited scope focusing on temporary measures like fentanyl cooperation and supply chain adjustments underscores ongoing economic competition, with both sides retaining leverage for future talks. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tOutlook</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tGlobal crude oil supplies are poised for a deepening glut, with prices likely to decline toward $50 per barrel by mid-2026 amid sluggish demand growth and robust production. Oil prices are projected to trade in a broader $56–$63 range in the coming weeks, with markets closely watching global manufacturing activities in the coming week.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em><strong>(Disclaimer: This article is by Mohammed Imran, research analyst, Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

As the APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said Nvidia will supply around 260,000 GPUs to support South Korea's AI computing capabilities. The company will also work with Samsung and other South Korean technology firms, including SK Hynix and Hyundai, to improve manufacturing processes using AI and to accelerate the development of new technologies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSanta Clara-based Nvidia, whose GPU chips power much of the global AI industry, featured in talks Thursday between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Gyeongju, where the leaders agreed to take steps to ease their escalating trade war.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFollowing the meeting, Trump said he discussed sales of computer chips to China. Trump and former President Joe Biden have imposed restrictions on China's access to the most advanced chips, including those used for AI. Trump said China will speak with Nvidia about purchasing its chips, but not the company's latest Blackwell AI chips.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15 per cent cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut there are also concerns over a potential AI bubble.
