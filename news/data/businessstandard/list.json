Police are investigating that potential abuse of power. The ex-prince has consistently denied all claims against him.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAs Charles’ shock statement defenestrating his brother landed on Thursday evening, Giuffre’s family made clear not only their pride in her for bravely challenging the account of a powerful prince, but that justice for the surviving victims must follow.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThey are right. Mountbatten Windsor still has questions to answer about what he saw at Epstein’s mansion. He should finally give evidence in cases pending against the billionaire’s estate.

They allegedly include dozens of politicians, business leaders and academics, whose friendship he cultivated in the vain hope it would make him look weighty and clever.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong them is an individual she refers to as the ex-minister, whom she claims was the most violent of her rapists. During one alleged assault she said she thought she would die, yet when she complained to Epstein he allegedly told her: “You’ll get that sometimes.” It was this nonchalant absence of concern that made Giuffre realize he cared little for her welfare.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThat the outrage over Epstein and his coterie hasn’t died down over the past decade suggests the public does care, viscerally. Charles’ humiliation of his own brother is living proof.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe elite figures who cozied up to the financier, lapping up the wealthy trappings without questioning his surrounding himself with very young “masseuses,” need to tell us what they saw. Though it may be a long wait, given the omerta so far.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tA few years ago, a shocking photo emerged of the model Naomi Campbell’s 31st birthday party on board a yacht, in which a child-like Giuffre can be seen in the foreground.

It’s time for witnesses to come forward, including the many cooks, housekeepers, pilots, personal assistants and other staff retained by Epstein.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tFor the past year, Congress and the White House have obfuscated, using political tricks such as early recess and the government shutdown to prevent disclosing the hundreds of gigabytes of data plus other material held by the FBI relating to Epstein and associates, including his jailed girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe’ve already learned plenty from the limited release of the Epstein files so far, helped by my colleagues on Bloomberg News. In September, the UK ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, had to resign over revelations by Bloomberg that he kept associating with Epstein after the pedophile’s first incarceration. Now Windsor Mountbatten has been sacked by the royal family.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhy has the British establishment, not known historically for its alacrity, acted more swiftly than its US counterpart to try to cut out the Epstein cancer. UK tabloids are ferocious diggers, but public disgust at the affair and hunger for justice is no less potent in America. Quite the opposite.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to his own accounts of his sometime friendship with Epstein, Donald Trump has nothing to fear from a full release of the files. Giuffre said the president didn’t abuse or mistreat her, and she never saw him at Epstein properties.

We always see H2 (in terms of FY26) performance-wise quite tilted towards being 30 to 40 per cent better than H1. We will see higher volumes in H2, and typically with higher volumes and longer run hours, you have less expenditure for shutdown and other one-time expenditures that go into the plant, which results in a lower cost of operation.

Our earlier commitment for the demerger to conclude by the end of March 2026; that timeline does not change,” he said, adding that the company’s guidance on profitability for the full financial year remains at about $6 billion, or around ₹53,000 crore.
