It ensures the safety of marine animals during their breeding and mating season, said officials, adding that the ban has been clamped in accordance with Sections 2, 7 and 4 of Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act (OMFRA), 1982 and provisions of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ban will be strictly implemented as it is done every year to save turtles, as these endangered species perish in larger numbers either by getting entangled in fishing nets or being hit by fishing trawler propellers, an official said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAs per the arrangements, a multi-layered patrolling exercise will be done involving the forest, fisheries, and marine police, besides the coast guard personnel.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo ensure effective patrolling, 61 on-shore camps and five off-shore camps have been set up in the state's four wildlife divisions - Bhadrak, Rajnagar, Puri and Berhampur.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe armed police force will flank the forest and fisheries patrolling teams. Five high-speed boats, 13 trawlers and support boats are pressed into service to intercept illegal marine fishing in prohibited zones, said Sudrashan Gopinath Yadav, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (wildlife) Forest Division.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAround 11,000 fishermen families will be affected due to the ban. To compensate for the loss of income avenues, the state government has decided to extend one-time livelihood assistance of Rs 15,000 to the affected fishermen families, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOdisha Traditional Fish Workers Union (OTFWU), an organisation of fishermen, however, demanded that the amount be enhanced to Rs 30,000 and include all families depending on fishing-related works, including small-time fish traders under the scheme.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tK Yellayya, general secretary of the union, said they demand a reduction of the ban period from seven months to five months and from 20 km from the coast to 5 km and provide alternative livelihood support to all affected families, depending on fishing and its related activities<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe female turtles virtually invade the nesting beaches usually at the dead of the night for laying eggs, the phenomenon otherwise described as 'Arribada'. After laying eggs, the turtles leave the nesting ground and enter the sea. Hatchlings emerge from these eggs after 45-60 days. It is a rare natural phenomenon where the babies grow without their mother.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

The forum, he said, focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US stakeholders are concerned about China's growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted that Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy- and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US underinvestment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Atlantic Council warned that these supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption. It noted that China has shown a willingness to weaponise its dominance, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe added that this uncertainty has a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profit, according to Dawn.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

He is accused of hiding the fact that the Dwarapalaka (guardian deity) idols were gold-plated, and falsely recording them as copper sheets in the temple’s official documents.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Third arrest in the case</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKumar is the third person arrested in the case, after Potty, who sponsored the electroplating of the Dwarapalaka idol plates in 2019, and former administrative officer B Murari Babu. Officials said he will be presented before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court. The SIT has also questioned Vasudevan, a close aide of Potty, who allegedly kept an additional gold-plated pedestal from the idol, later found at a relative’s house in Thiruvananthapuram.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How did the gold go missing?</strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the report, investigators said Kumar had been associated with Sabarimala since the 1990s and knew the idols were covered in gold. In 2019, when the Dwarapalaka plates were handed over to the main accused, Unnikrishnan Potty, for gold plating, Kumar allegedly listed them as copper. This allowed Potty to remove the existing gold plating without raising suspicion.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Gold recovered from Karnataka</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn October, the SIT recovered about 400 grams of stolen gold from a jewellery shop in Bellari, Karnataka. The gold had been handed over by Potty to his associate Govardhan, whose shop was raided by the police. Investigators also found gold coins and ₹2 lakh in cash at Potty’s home in Pulimath, Thiruvananthapuram.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sabarimala temple gold theft</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 2019, copper plates clad in gold that adorned the Dwarapalaka idols and other sacred panels at the temple were removed for re-plating. The initial weight of the gold-clad plates was approximately 42.8 kg. However, when they were handed over to a firm in Chennai, their weight dropped to about 38.26 kg, leaving an unexplained shortfall of around 4.54 kg.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(With inputs from PTI)</em></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
