            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to make India’s tax system more trust-based, simpler, and technology-driven in the Union Budget 2026-27, with a focus on faster dispute resolution and easier Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rules. “India’s next leap requires a principle-based, technology-enabled, and trust-anchored tax system,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said after the industry body met the revenue secretary on Friday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCII noted that tax litigation continues to burden businesses, with more than five lakh appeals involving nearly ₹18 lakh crore pending before the commissioner (appeals). It asked the government to fast-track cases involving more than ₹100 crore and resolve them within one year through virtual hearings and close monitoring by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Penalty proceedings should be paused till the main appeal is settled, and draft orders should be shared for factual checks before being finalised, it suggested. CII also sought revival of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) under retired high court judges, “empowered to deliver binding rulings within six months”.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build taxpayer confidence, CII called for converting the existing taxpayer charter into a legal Taxpayer Rights Charter guaranteeing time-bound refunds, faceless assessments, and accountability for administrative delays. It also flagged issues in the Central Processing Centre (CPC) system for return processing and asked for “improved protocols ensuring that only apparent mistakes are adjusted automatically and that taxpayers can request virtual hearings when required”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn direct tax simplification, CII said the TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework — with more than 35 categories and multiple rates — has become too complex and affects business liquidity. It recommended reducing the framework to two or three broad rates, exempting transactions between Goods and Services Tax (GST)-registered entities, and clarifying that no TDS should apply to the GST portion of a payment. “Tax simplification is not a concession; it is an investment in governance efficiency,” Banerjee said. “When rules are clear and systems are digital, compliance becomes automatic and disputes become exceptional.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn indirect taxes and customs, CII pitched a one-time settlement scheme for old disputes, longer validity for advance rulings, and full digital processing of customs through Application Programming Interface (API)-based systems. It suggested a roadmap for “paper-free customs by 2028” with e-refunds, e-adjudication, and e-appeals. CII also called for rationalising tariffs by consolidating exemption notifications and permitting a single appeal for multiple bills of entry (BoE) where issues are common, along with automatic release of bonds once export obligations are met.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo improve predictability, CII suggested a multi-year corporate tax roadmap and removal of prosecution for minor and unintentional errors under both direct and indirect tax laws. “CII’s proposals are not about cutting taxes, but they are about cutting friction,” Banerjee said, adding that a trust-based compliance system can boost revenues without hurting the exchequer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India has already shown the world that large-scale reforms like GST 2.0 can succeed,” he said. “If we now make our tax systems as simple and predictable as they are digital and fair, we will not only raise revenues more efficiently but also build the foundations of an economy that inspires confidence — both at home and abroad.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Given that the seven-year is an illiquid bond, mainly held by banks, bidders sought a higher yield,” said the treasury head at a private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If the RBI had accepted those bids, it would have sent the wrong signal to the market and pushed yields even higher. That’s why the RBI rejected them,” the treasury head added.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the time of the auction, the seven-year bond was trading at 6.46 per cent, later easing to 6.43 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMarket participants said public-sector banks (PSBs) were completely absent from the auction. Dealers said that bidding weakened after a technical breakout at 6.56 per cent, with many PSBs already sitting on large mark-to-market losses, making them reluctant to take on additional risk. Some expect yields to breach 6.6 per cent and possibly retest 6.65 per cent, prompting state-run banks to remain on the sidelines.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“PSBs were completely absent from the seven-year paper. The bidding was weak after the technical breakout at 6.56 per cent. They’re already holding large loss positions, so it’s riskier for them to buy more,” said a dealer at a primary dealership.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother market participant noted that banks are not adding bonds to their held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“After the change in investment portfolio norms came into effect on April 1, 2024, banks are reluctant to add bonds to their HTM portfolios. The seven-year bond is usually kept in the HTM book of PSBs, but with yields rising, nobody wants to take that risk,” said the treasury head at another private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the RBI’s revised framework, banks must categorise their entire bond investment portfolio into three buckets —HTM, available-for-sale (AFS), and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The new rules merge the earlier held-for-trading sub-category into FVTPL.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBanks are no longer allowed to reclassify investments between HTM, AFS, and FVTPL without board and regulatory approval. Securities under the held-for-trading sub-category within FVTPL must be fair-valued daily, while other FVTPL securities are to be valued at least quarterly, or more frequently if required.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the new norms, bonds classified as HTM must remain there permanently, except for up to 5 per cent of the portfolio that can be shifted during the year.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n<!-- -->\n<div style=\"float:left;clear:both;font-style:italic;padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;width:615px\">\r\n\t\t\ta</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
