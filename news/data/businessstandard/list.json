The return of the Palestinian remains was confirmed by a doctor at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, where medical workers were striving to identify them.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Gaza and Israel grapple with latest exchange of bodies</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tPhotos showed the remains, in white body bags, arranged in rows inside the grounds of Nasser Hospital. Health officials have struggled to identify bodies without access to DNA kits.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe handover brings the number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel to 225, only 75 of which have been identified by families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe bodies returned had been torn apart and exhumed, Munir al-Bursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, said in a post on X.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir flesh had melted, their faces erased by fire, leaving behind only bones and teeth, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Israeli military has previously told The Associated Press that all bodies returned so far are those of combatants, a claim the AP was unable to verify. The military has said it operates in accordance with international law.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAl-Bursh said recently that many of the bodies handed over appear to be fighters or others killed during the 2023 attack. Several relatives who have identified the bodies of family members said they weren't fighters.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late Thursday that the remains returned by Palestinian militants had been confirmed as those of Sahar Baruch and Amiram Cooper, both taken hostage during the 2023 attack.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHamas has now returned the remains of 17 hostages since the start of the ceasefire, with 11 others still in Gaza and set to be turned over under the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday a small crowd of Israelis gathered in the plaza known as Hostages Square, praying together for the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe cannot give up until everybody, all the bodies, will be here,\" said Rimona Velner, a Tel Aviv resident who joined the gathering. It's very important to the families and for us ... to close this circle.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Warning to Hamas</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tA senior US official and a second source familiar with negotiations said that in messages passed to Hamas by mediators on Wednesday, Israel warned the militant group that its fighters had 24 hours to leave the yellow zone or face strikes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat deadline passed Thursday evening, after which the senior US official said Israel will enforce the ceasefire and engage Hamas targets behind the yellow line. Hamas did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Shifa hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said that one person had been killed by Israeli gunfire in northern Gaza. Israel's military said its troops had fired after the person approached troops in a way that posed a threat.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a new assessment released Friday, the United Nations said satellite photos taken in early October show that 81 percent of all buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or otherwise damaged in the conflict.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGovernment officials from eight Arab and Muslim nations will gather in Istanbul on Monday to discuss the next steps for Gaza, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe talks follow a meeting between the countries' leaders and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations Security Council, preceding the ceasefire agreement. They mark the latest effort to create an International Stabilization Force in Gaza, outlined in a 20-point US plan.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ceasefire, which began October 10, is aimed at winding down a war that is by far the deadliest and most destructive of those ever fought between Israel and Hamas.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the October 2023 attack on Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the two years since, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 68,600 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and is staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIsrael, which some international critics have accused of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the figures without providing its own tally.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Israeli fire kills teen in West Bank</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tIn the central West Bank town of Silwad on Friday, mourners thronged the streets for the funeral of Yamen Hamed, 15, who Palestinian health officials say was shot by an Israeli soldier overnight. Samed Yousef Hamed kissed his son goodbye.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSamed said his son left home Thursday to hang out with friends. Soon after, he learned the teen had been injured and Israel's army was preventing an ambulance from reaching him. Ahed Smirat, the ambulance driver who tried to reach Hamed following the shooting, told the AP that troops held him up multiple times. By the time they let him through, troops told him the teen had died, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIsrael's military called the teen a terrorist and said troops had fired believing that he was holding an explosive, but did not provide any evidence to support that characterization. Hamed's funeral was Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe shooting is the latest in a surge of military killings of Palestinian children in the West Bank that has accompanied a general upswing in violence in the territory since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Some were killed during Israeli military raids in dense neighbourhoods, others by sniper fire in peaceful areas.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe killings have risen as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in the occupied West Bank since the war's onset in what it calls a crackdown on militants.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR INITIATE THE NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER, Trump said in a late night social media post Thursday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump's sudden decision to assert himself into the shutdown now in its 31st day bringing the highly charged demand to end the filibuster is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators toward their own compromise or send the chamber spiralling toward a new sense of crisis.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, the president few have dared to counter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSenate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules to end the shutdown, arguing that it is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe leader's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged, Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged. And former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump's filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding it's not my call, from his chamber across the Capitol.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster, Johnson said, adding that Trump's comments are the president's anger at the situation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Broad GOP support for filibuster</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tEven if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate, Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah posted on X Friday morning, responding to Trump's comments and echoing the sentiments of many of his Senate Republican colleagues. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn't. I'm a firm no on eliminating it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDebate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago. But they ultimately didn't have the votes after enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Little progress on shutdown</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tTrump's demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to becoming the longest in history.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said in his post that he gave a great deal of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why powerful Republicans allow the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut later Friday he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved. Democrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the health care subsidies. The Republicans say they won't negotiate until the government is reopened.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrom coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the centre of the stalemate.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tPeople are stressing, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe are well past time to have this behind us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Money for military, but not food aid</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's big, beautiful bill signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the programme.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday the agency cannot release contingency funds to keep SNAP running, an issue now facing a legal challenge in court.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWe are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care, said Rev. Ryan Stoess during a prayer with religious leaders at the US Capitol.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGod help us, he said, when the cruelty is the point.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Deadlines shift to next week</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe House remains closed under Johnson with no plans to resume the session, and senators left for the weekend and are due back Monday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIf the shutdown continues into next week, it would surpass the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the US-Mexico border wall.</p><p></p></div>",

He and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe adminstration's policies have faced pushback in the courts as trans troops and their supporters say they have proven their worth to the military, but the US Supreme Court in May allowed the ban to be enforced while legal challenges proceed.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new memo, which advocates say was only made available to troops last week, also sets up an additional hurdle of requiring that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth and if they fail to do so, their absence can be used against them.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe policy and specifically the uniform mandate will force a lot of people not to be able to attend their separation board hearings, according to Emily Starbuck Gerson, a spokeswoman for SPARTA Pride, an advocacy group for transgender troops and veterans.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey're already essentially being rigged with a predetermined outcome and then now you're further penalizing someone for not showing up because they can't wear the wrong uniform, Gerson added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen asked about the memo, Pentagon assistant press secretary Riley Podleski said that as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe policy follows an Air Force directive reported by The Associated Press in August, which said separation boards could not independently decide whether to keep or discharge transgender troops and instead must recommend separation of the member if they have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria when a person's biological sex does not match up with their gender identity.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerson said the new policy that applies to all the services feels very similar to what the Air Force rolled out but noted that some of the additional hurdles like the uniform mandate were alarming.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe October memo says, should the Service member not conform to uniform and grooming standards, board proceedings will continue with the Service member in absentia and may, as appropriate, take the Service member's failure to comply with standards intro consideration when determining whether the basis for separation has been established.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMany transgender troops have been serving for years and likely don't own uniforms in the gender assigned to them at birth. And they say forcing them into those uniforms would feel wrong.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLogan Ireland, a master sergeant in the Air Force with 15 years of service, said he has been seen as a man for most of his adult life and for almost 13 years of his military service.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt would be a betrayal of what the military has seen me as, he said, adding that it would be like a costume-like effect.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIreland, like almost all other transgender troops, is on administrative leave, and he is sporting a long beard.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCan I put on a skirt or wear the female dress uniform? Sure, yes. ... But does that reflect who I am and what I appear to be on a daily basis? No, and it just creates a lot of confusion, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerson, the advocate, says the new policy seems to run counter to the ideal of a merit-based military that Hegseth has touted.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It does not account for the service member's career history, accomplishments, training and the necessity to their field, she said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIreland also noted that the policy \"denies us the dignity and respect we were promised as we are forced out of a service that once honoured our contributions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe boards traditionally offer troops who are facing separation from the military a chance at a quasi-legal hearing to determine if that service member still has value to the military and should stay on. Fellow service members hear evidence of whatever wrongdoing occurred and about the person's character, fitness and performance.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile not a formal court hearing, it has much the same structure. Service members are often represented by lawyers, they can present evidence in their defense and they can appeal the board's findings to a federal court.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Pentagon's policy on separating officers notes that they are entitled to fair and impartial hearings that should be a forum for the officer concerned to present reasons the contemplated action should not be taken.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis impartial nature means that the boards can sometimes reach surprising conclusions. For example, the commanding officer of the USS McCain, a destroyer that collided with an oil tanker in the Pacific in 2017, killing 10, was not recommended for separation in 2019.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMore recently, the three active duty Marines who were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, were also retained.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPriya Rashid, a military lawyer who has represented service members before hundreds of separation boards, said the fact that commanders can override this process for trans troops subverts justice.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tService members who are accused of serious misconduct, violent misconduct, sex-based misconduct ... are being afforded more due process protections and more rights and entitlements than this group of people solely based on the administrative label of gender dysphoria, she said.</p><p></p></div>",

But political rivals and lawmakers hostile to Milei's agenda considered him a confidant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrancos was appointed chief of staff last year as the irascible political outsider sought help from the seasoned negotiator in persuading Congress to pass wide-ranging economic overhaul measures to trim the fiscal budget and spur foreign investment.

To show his openness to dialogue, Milei welcomed 20 of Argentina's 24 governors to the presidential headquarters on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe four governors excluded from the meeting represented Peronism, the populist opposition movement widely blamed for delivering the economic shambles that Milei inherited in the 2023.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a TV interview with a local channel late Thursday, Mieli defended his decision to leave out the Peronist governors, saying, It's very hard to have a reasonable dialogue.

The achievement is the result of a well-planned research and survey, meticulous implementation, community participation and coordinated efforts of various departments. Kerala’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan speaks about the journey so far in an interview to the media today.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The government is all set to declare Kerala as Extreme Poverty Free State in November this year. What we communicate to the world while doing this?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt gives the world a strong message that, with collective efforts and cooperation of the Local Self Governments, society, and various government departments, poverty and even extreme poverty can be completely wiped out from a region. Kerala becomes the first state in the country to fully achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals of 'No Poverty' and 'Zero Hunger'. This achievement reminds us that the development leaving no one left out is possible. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The extreme poverty eradication programme was one of the major decisions of the first Cabinet of the Second LDF government led by you. How has been the journey towards this since last four years? </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Government has launched this project in 2021 with an aim to find out the families who live in extreme poverty and to help them to get out of this condition. A detailed survey was conducted by the Local Self Government. The survey identified 64,006 families as extremely poor based on the factors such as income, health, food, and housing. Subsequently, a comprehensive action plan was prepared for each family.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThese micro plans were implemented with the support of local self-government institutions, Kudumbashree, LIFE Mission, and Health and other government departments. In the first year of the project, 47.89 per cent of the population from the surveyed list was lifted out of poverty. As of September 16 this year, from the families covered by the programme, 53,699 families (84 per cent) have been lifted out of extreme poverty. From the list those who were included in the extreme poverty line at the time of extreme poverty identification and later died, those who were migrated to other states, whom appeared twice in the list, and those who did not need a micro-plan, were excluded. Thus, 55861 families (96.13 per cent) have been freed from extreme poverty. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the first year, the Government focused more on the most essential and inevitable factors; that is, food and health care. In addition to this, under the Avakasham Athivegam campaign, 21263 poor people were provided with entitlements including Voter Id, Aadhar, ration card, Health insurance, identity cards for differently abled, Bank accounts, employment card and emergency services. Through the dedicated and collective works of the State Government, the social security institutions and Local Self Governments those families who were in need of continuous support for food and health services were taken care of. The needy families were supported by social security pension, and the homeless families by LIFE Mission, the housing scheme. Through the Ujjeevanam Scheme implemented by Kudumbashree, a livelihood and regular income were ensured. Mostly, the beneficiaries were in need of land and house, only house or renovation of house.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUntil now, 4677 families who were in need of only houses were given financial support to construct houses which have been completed. There were 2713 families who needed both a house and land have had their houses built. 5646 houses have been renovated and financial support have been provided to families who needed house renovation. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The UN has set to achieve its Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030 and the Goal 1 is to end poverty and deprivation in all forms while making development economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Why Kerala focused on the eradication of extreme poverty instead of poverty eradication?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKerala has made great strides in eradicating poverty. Poverty was 59.8 per cent in 1973-74. It has come down to 0.55 per cent in 2019-21. Therefore, in the next phase, the government has focused on uplifting the poorest sections of the society and helping them to escape from extreme poverty. This has led to the goal of ‘Eradicating Extreme Poverty’. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What are the preparations as a whole to achieve this?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPreparations for the eradication of extreme poverty were carried out in various stages. First, a detailed survey was conducted by the Local Self Governments to identify the people living in extreme poverty. In the first stage information gathering was conducted locally by evaluating the conditions of food, health, income, housing needs for each family. In the second stage shortterm, interim and long-term micro plans were prepared based on the needs of each family. The third stage was project implementation. The project is being implemented by the Local Self-Government Department with the support of the Local Self-Government Institutions, Kudumbashree, LIFE Mission, various government departments including Health department, NGOs, resident associations. Major component of the project was funding. The government has allocated Rs. 50-crore each for the years 2023-24 and 2024-25 for this project. These funds have been utilised for health, housing and livelihood. This year, Rs. 60-crore has been allocated.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What are the strategies for the government for balancing governance between the infrastructure development and welfare measures? </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the Extreme Poverty Eradication Project, you can see that infrastructure such as housing through the LIFE Mission and welfare schemes such as health care, food distribution, educational assistance, and employment opportunities through the 'Ujjivanam' scheme have been given equal importance. This indicates the government's priority to include infrastructure and welfare side by side. Along with this the government has prioritised development of road networks, water metro, renovation of KSRTC etc. We have a holistic approach towards development.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Dharmadam has become the first extreme poverty free constituency in India. How do you foresee this achievement as the MLA of the constituency? </strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDharmadam is the first constituency in the country to be declared an extreme poverty free constituency. As the MLA of the constituency, I must say that it is not a personal achievement but the result of a collective effort from all walks of the society. The most important aspect of this success is collective efforts by the LSGD Department with the support of LSGD Institutions,</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Kerala scored No 1 in the country in terms of Human Development and many development priorities. But we see many campaigns disregarding data, for eg- the movie Kerala Story and the support it received in terms of national recognition. Do you think Kerala is less understood in the country? </strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt is a fact that Kerala ranks first in the country in the Human Development Index and other development priorities. Kerala has achieved heights in areas such as literacy, improved healthcare, low infant mortality, etc. However, some campaigns like movie The Kerala Story that are gaining national attention may be part of an attempt to spread certain perceptions unrelated to these development achievements of Kerala. There may be two reasons for this. First one is different perspectives on the development model. While some section of people accepts Kerala’s development model another section may try to see it from a different political or social perspective rather than its development angle. Another reason is the impact of propaganda strategies. The influence of social media and art forms like cinema in the society is very much. The stories spread through these mediums often influence people’s emotions rather than factual reality. Such attempts may create a different picture of Kerala at the national level which is far from the reality. I cannot give a definite answer to the question whether Kerala is not understood properly in the country. However, this situation gives an indication of how certain narratives influence society beyond development and reality.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Kudumbashree is a national model. What is the role of Kudumbashree in achieving the goal of extreme poverty eradication? </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCM: Kudumbashree played a crucial role in the efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. With the support of Kudumbashree, a campaign named 'Ujjeevanam' was launched. Through this project, Families experiencing extreme poverty were provided with job training, microfinance and entrepreneurship assistance. Kudumbashree distributed food through 'Janakiya Hotels'. 4394 families were able to provide a source of income through the Kudumbashree Ujjeevanam project.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Extreme poverty is invisible poverty, which is difficult to identify. How important for a government to uplift their invisible poor who are nowhere documented? </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCM: Identifying those living in extreme poverty is a challenge. That is why the government adopted a unique method household-level data collection to identify the vulnerable people. This has been done based on the factors leading to extreme poverty such as health problems, malnutrition, lack of income, and homelessness. The campaign Avakasam Athivegam has been designed to speedy issue entitlements such as essential identity cards such as ration cards, Aadhar cards, health cards etc. This helped them to avail other welfare services easily. This is the way the government addressed the invisible poverty</div></div>",
