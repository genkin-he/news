            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tColdplay played in January and Guns N’ Roses performed in May: India wants more live concerts, so musicians David Guetta, Jacob Collier and rock band The Script will be among artists touring the country later this year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLive events were once a smaller part of India’s media and entertainment sector, but the segment now comprises up to 30 per cent of ticketing platforms’ total revenue. The segment in FY25 contributed around Rs 10,500 crore to the media and entertainment sector’s revenue of Rs 1.45 trillion, according to PwC India. The amount is almost 7 per cent of the industry’s overall spending. While movie ticket sales are a larger source of ticketing platforms’ revenue, live events became crucial after Ahmedabad in January became the venue for Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres World Tour biggest concert.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRahul Ganjoo, chief executive officer (CEO) of going-out platform District by Zomato, said that movie tickets will continue anchoring ticketing revenue due to its volume and frequency, while live events will grow disproportionately. The platform’s October-December lineup includes Rolling Loud, the world’s largest hip-hop festival featuring over 30 international and homegrown artists; footballer Lionel Messi’s GOAT India Tour, and tours by Spanish singer-songwriter Enrique Iglesias and Senegalese-American musician Akon, who featured in Hindi song Chammak Challo.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBookMyShow, a ticketing and entertainment platform which was the partner for the Coldplay and Guns N’ Roses concerts, expects demand for live events to continue. Naman Pugalia, chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, said Linkin Park, Playboi Carti and The Lumineers will perform in Delhi NCR next year. Mumbai will host Sunburn 2025 and later Lollapalooza India 2026, and Bandland 2026.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ticket sales for live events in India now make up for almost 25 to 30 per cent of total ticketing revenue, with spending on live events growing at a much faster rate than on movies,” said Rajesh Sethi, partner and leader, media, entertainment and sports, PwC India.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This shift is because more people want real experiences like concerts and sports rather than just watching only films. For ticketing platforms, live-event ticketing has become a key growth area and is nearly equal to or even ahead of movie ticket sales in terms of strategic importance. What was once a niche is now turning into a key revenue stream, joining digital media, OTT [over-the-top media], and gaming. Live entertainment segment’s ability to deliver memorable experiences, connect emotionally with audiences, and attract brands makes it a valuable and growing part of the entertainment mix” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSethi, however, noted that growth could be constrained due to limited venues, regulatory permissions, high costs, and poor transport infrastructure. Earlier in October, Sanjay Jaju, secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said that the government is looking at doubling India’s concert economy. He also announced that the government is revamping the India Cine Hub website to create a single-window platform for concerts, streamlining the process of securing the various permissions required.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Deloitte India, the live events industry is by various estimates valued between Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore. Recognising its potential, the government in August formed a joint working group dedicated to promoting and supporting the live events industry, said Chandrashekar Mantha, partner, media and entertainment sector leader, Deloitte India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“[Music band] Passenger’s intimate three-city tour is set to strike a soulful chord with fans, while Jon Batiste’s India debut will bring a touch of Grammy-winning brilliance to the mix. Guitar legend Tom Morello’s highly anticipated arrival as part of Bandland on Tour will further amplify the excitement, alongside Post Malone’s first-ever show in the Northeast (Guwahati), marking an expansion of India’s live music footprint beyond traditional metros,” said Pugalia, adding that its recent partnership with RuPay marks a significant step in reimagining access and engagement for today’s culture-forward consumer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDistrict by Zomato has recorded year-on-year growth in live events, driven by an expanding portfolio of ticketed intellectual property and curated experiences.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ticket sales have surged in parallel, signalling strong consumer appetite for premium entertainment and world-class production. While Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi NCR remain key markets, tier-II cities are emerging as significant growth drivers. This momentum stems from a richer event calendar featuring more international artists and festivals, coupled with a clear premiumisation trend: audiences are increasingly willing to pay for top-tier talent and venues,” Ganjoo noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSethi and Ganjoo both emphasised that the segment is seeing a notable shift from passive sponsorship and branding to immersive collaborations starting from pre-media buzz to interactive promotions for concert attendees, which is beyond just logo visibility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Brand participation in live events has surged, driven by their cultural relevance and unmatched experiential impact. Categories like beverages and FMCG are leading this charge, alongside a notable influx of fintech players like HSBC, who are heavily investing in live entertainment as a key engagement channel. These brands recognise live events as powerful storytelling platforms that foster authentic consumer connections, particularly with younger, affluent audiences,” Ganjoo said.</div></div>",

This is because it is a mass product without any approved generic by any developed market regulatory agency, especially the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Due to this, we think Health Canada is cautious before it approves the first semaglutide generic. DRL has a first-to-file (FTF) for this product in Canada and this seems to be its third review,” Nuvama said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that analysts have observed a couple of complex products getting approved after two review cycles. “Therefore, we are still building the product approval near the patent expiry,” Nuvama added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, a report from Morgan Stanley adds that success in Canada for generic semaglutide is a key driver for the firm’s FY27 earnings, with timely approval and launch key to staying on that track.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Bank of America (BofA) stated that while the semaglutide approval may have been pushed out, it still sees the drug being launched in the first half of FY27 (H1FY27) rather than a lost opportunity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Dr Reddy’s has a filing in 87 countries and indicated confidence to sell all 12 million pens in FY27 even if Canada approval is delayed. This could offset impact from delay,” BofA added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn its part, DRL stated that it will submit a response to the NoN promptly and within the stipulated time frame.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We remain confident in the quality, safety and comparability of our proposed product and remain committed to making this important therapy available to patients in Canada and other markets at the earliest,” the drug major said in its regulatory filing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn Thursday, DRL’s shares dropped by 3.94 per cent, closing the day at ₹1.203.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</div></div>",
