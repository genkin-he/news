Building such capability, both within Sebi and across market institutions, will remain our key priority,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Sebi chief said India’s capital markets had become a key pillar of economic growth, underpinned by reforms that had made them more efficient, inclusive, and resilient. India’s financial system, he noted, now functions as an interconnected ecosystem linking banks, corporates, mutual funds, insurers, pension funds, and fintechs through a web of transactions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“These linkages bring efficiency and expand access to capital, but they also make the system more complex. A disruption in one segment can transmit rapidly to another,” he cautioned, stressing the need for coordination through the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite global challenges such as shifting trade policies, rising debt, and geopolitical tensions, Pandey said India’s financial system had remained stable. This resilience, he added, reflects the shared commitment of regulators and market participants to safeguard stability while enabling growth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe highlighted the widening reach of India’s capital markets, with the number of unique investors rising from about 40 million in FY19 to over 135 million. Market capitalisation has increased from 69 per cent of GDP in FY16 to around 129 per cent, while companies have raised nearly ₹7 trillion through equity and debt issuances in the current financial year till September. Investor participation from smaller towns is also growing, with about 18 per cent of mutual fund assets now originating from beyond the top 30 cities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey outlined several reforms aimed at strengthening market structure and investor protection. These include stronger governance frameworks for exchanges and clearing corporations, tighter liquidity norms and stress testing for mutual funds, and improved transparency in the corporate bond market. Sebi has also revised norms for SME IPOs and equity derivatives to ensure market integrity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo enhance ease of doing business, Sebi has simplified IPO and listing processes, digitised filings, streamlined KYC norms, and proposed relaxed requirements for NRIs. It has also set clear approval timelines and improved grievance redressal.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey said Sebi continues to foster market innovation. The regulator has expanded the scope of strategic investors in REITs and InvITs, reclassified REITs as equity for mutual fund investments, and introduced put options in non-convertible securities to enhance liquidity.
