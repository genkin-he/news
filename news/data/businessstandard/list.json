Narayana Health will also gain control over Practice Plus Group’s 330 in-patient and outpatient beds.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe deal further extends Narayana Health’s international footprint, building on its earlier foray into the Caribbean through Health City Cayman Islands, the company said in a filing to the BSE.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDevi Prasad Shetty, founder and chairman of Narayana Health, said, “The acquisition of Practice Plus Group Hospitals and surgical centres is an incredibly exciting step for Narayana Health. Like us, Practice Plus Group recognised that while the majority of patients struggle to access healthcare, only a minority can afford costly private care.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“We have both been working to serve those in between, to offer a new choice of more accessible private healthcare. Together, we are a perfect fit, and I look forward to welcoming Practice Plus Group to Narayana Health and helping many more patients get the care they need,” Shetty added.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tPractice Plus Group is the fifth-largest private hospital network in the UK, the company said in a release. Through this acquisition, Narayana Health gains access to a market where demand for surgeries—especially in the private sector—is projected to rise sharply in the coming years.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tJim Easton, chief executive of Practice Plus Group, praised Narayana Health’s reputation for high-quality, efficient care delivered with a human touch, saying he is “excited about what our hospitals and surgical centres can achieve with the commitment and expertise of Narayana Health behind us”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn September, UK-based development finance institution CDC Group invested $48 million (₹300 crore) for a minority stake in Devi Shetty-led Narayana Hrudayalaya, the operator of the Narayana Health chain.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
