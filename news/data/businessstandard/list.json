It is a structural defect in the skull that affects how the brain sits and functions. Doctors have described the case as extremely unusual, given that such clustering in one family is exceptionally rare.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat is Chiari malformation?</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, Chiari malformation (CM) occurs when part of the brain, known as the cerebellum, extends into the spinal canal through an opening at the base of the skull (foramen magnum). As per Dr David Harter, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone, this happens when the lower portion of the brain doesn’t fit properly within the skull. This can block the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid and put pressure on the brain as well as the spinal cord.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe condition is often congenital (condition or trait that is present at birth) but may not show symptoms until later in life. Common signs include:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\t Severe headaches – especially when coughing or straining</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDizziness</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tBalance problems</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tMuscle weakness</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tNumbness in the limbs</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tHeart palpitations</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDifficulty falling asleep and chronic fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome cases also involve tethered spinal cords, where the spinal cord is abnormally attached, causing restricted movement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tHigginbotham sisters’ story</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe family’s journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, started showing worrying symptoms as a baby such as constant crying, poor sleep, tremors, and developmental delays. At 18 months, she was diagnosed with Chiari malformation and spinal compression, requiring surgery to relieve pressure and restore fluid flow.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSoon after, her sister Amelia, aged three, was diagnosed with the same condition and a tethered spinal cord. She underwent two surgeries in October 2023. Then, Aubrey, aged seven, developed similar symptoms and had surgery a month later, in November 2023. The eldest affected sister, Adalee aged 11, had struggled with leg pain and mobility issues for years before being diagnosed. Her surgery was performed in March 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe girls have since recovered well, with their mother noting that Austyn “was trying to walk, smiling, full of energy” shortly after surgery. The two elder kids were also tested, and did not have the condition.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Jeffrey Greenfield, pediatric neurosurgeon at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, who treated the sisters, described the occurrence as “extraordinary”, noting that only about 10 per cent of Chiari cases have a known genetic link, and it is even rarer for several siblings within the same family to be affected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tThe road to recovery</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTreatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the level of pressure on the brain and spine. In serious cases, decompression surgery is performed to remove a small portion of bone at the skull base, helping normalise fluid flow. According to US-based Cleveland Clinic, many patients experience significant relief post-surgery, though some may need follow-up procedures.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAll four Higginbotham sisters are now recovering under regular medical supervision. Early detection and intervention have been crucial in improving their outcomes. Without treatment, Chiari malformation can lead to chronic pain, nerve damage, or paralysis.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhy this case matters</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThis rare case underscores the importance of awareness and early diagnosis. Multiple siblings being diagnosed with the same structural brain defect highlights the potential genetic factors behind Chiari malformation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDoctors recommend that families with one diagnosed child consider screening siblings if symptoms appear. Recognising early warning signs such as persistent headaches, neck pain, or motor issues can make a life-changing difference.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Higginbotham family’s experience serves as both a medical mystery and a hopeful reminder: with timely diagnosis and specialist care, children with Chiari malformation can recover and live normal lives.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe INDIA bloc’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/elections/bihar-elections\" target=\"_blank\">Bihar election</a></strong> manifesto has set off a heated debate with its ambitious pledge -- a government job for one member of every family. Unveiled by <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rashtriya-janata-dal\" target=\"_blank\">Rashtriya Janata Dal</a></strong> (RJD) leader <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tejashwi-yadav\" target=\"_blank\">Tejashwi Yadav</a></strong> in Patna on October 28, the promise, if implemented, would mark one of the most sweeping welfare commitments in India’s political history.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut can Bihar’s finances and its administrative system afford it?</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tHow many families are in Bihar?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar’s projected population is about 130.7 million, and the 2023 caste survey identifies around 27.6 million families. With an average household size of 4.9 persons, this aligns with official estimates of 26–27 million households.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf taken literally, Tejashwi’s promise would mean creating 27 million new government jobs -- a number that dwarfs India’s total central and state government workforce combined.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhat would it cost the state?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven a conservative calculation shows the enormity of the challenge. Covering 25.6 million uncovered families with an average salary of ₹2.5 lakh per year, which is roughly the starting pay of an entry-level teacher, would cost ₹6.75 trillion annually, nearly double Bihar’s FY26 budget outlay.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar’s total FY26 outlay stands at ₹3.17 trillion, with expenditure (excluding debt repayment) of ₹2.94 trillion and receipts (excluding borrowings) of ₹2.61 trillion. Committed expenses, such as salaries, pensions, and interest payments, already consume 42 per cent of revenue receipts.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, Bihar’s fiscal deficit cannot exceed 3 per cent of GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product), which is about ₹32,718 crore for FY26. So any additional salary burden of this magnitude would shatter that ceiling.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWho are Bihar’s biggest employers now?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgriculture remains Bihar’s largest employer, followed by education, health, and policing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\tEducation: Over 6,00,000 teachers and staff, including contractual workers</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tPolice: Around 1,10,000 lakh personnel, with 64,000 more posts planned</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tHealth: Around 66,000 positions, including doctors, nurses, and ASHA workers</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTogether, education, police, and health account for most of Bihar’s 2.65 million government employees, far from the tens of millions implied by the manifesto.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBesides this, there is Panchayati Raj Department, under which 8053 Gram Panchayats, 533 Panchayat Samitis, and 38 Zila Parishads together employ thousands, with 942 Junior Engineers and several thousand others recruited through the BSSC.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhere could the promised jobs come from?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut if we were to assume that Tejashwi's promise does get fulfilled, where would the jobs be created? If implemented, the jobs could, in theory, come from multiple channels like direct state recruitment in education, healthcare, local administration, and public works. Yet Bihar’s sanctioned strength and vacancies suggest limited capacity without major restructuring.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar has identified food processing, IT/ITES, textiles, and dairy as priority sectors, but historically, turning such investments into millions of formal jobs has proven extremely difficult.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tStructural and social constraints</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBeyond the fiscal math, social realities further narrow feasibility. According to the 2023 caste survey, educational capacity further narrows the eligible pool. While Bihar’s overall literacy rate is 79.7 per cent, only 9.2 per cent have completed higher secondary education, and 7.46 per cent hold a graduate or higher degree. Among marginalised groups, the share is even lower at 3.44 per cent for SCs, 4.95 per cent for EBCs, and 3.87 per cent for STs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, most government posts demand at least matriculation, and clerical or technical roles often require graduation or professional training. At current education levels, only about one in four households may even have a member eligible for recruitment without large-scale skilling efforts.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the fiscal side, Bihar’s own-tax revenue stands at 5.4 per cent of GSDP, well below the levels of states with stronger tax bases. It contributes less than 1 per cent of India’s total income-tax collections and has one of the country’s lowest credit–deposit ratios, signalling weak private investment. Expanding government rolls without matching infrastructure like schools, hospitals, or offices could result in underutilised staff and falling service quality.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe bottom line</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe numbers make the arithmetic clear: a government job for every family would transform Bihar’s fiscal and labour landscape beyond recognition. Whether parties redefine “government job” to include contractual or time-bound roles, or stagger implementation over years, will determine how much of this pledge can move from political rhetoric to administrative reality.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor now, the data make one thing clear -- the scale of the government job promise dwarfs Bihar’s financial and structural capacity.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue to take a measured approach in developing its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), prioritising careful assessment over speed, even as it maintains a firm position against private cryptocurrencies, Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said on Thursday (October 30) at <em>Business Standard’s</em> annual <strong>BFSI Summit</strong> in Mumbai.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tResponding to a question on the pace of CBDC adoption, Sankar said India was technologically and operationally prepared to expand its digital currency pilots but would refrain from rushing into a full-scale launch. “Many countries are experimenting with CBDC. We do not want to rush or launch it full scale because everyone globally is just starting off. The use cases are still very different and limited,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe deputy governor emphasised that central banks worldwide were still analysing the broader macroeconomic and policy implications of CBDCs. “Everyone is waiting to see the impact of CBDC on the economy, so they can calibrate it with their policies. From the start, we have been saying we are in no hurry. Tech-wise, use case, programmability, we are by and large ready,” Sankar said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCross-border payments and CBDC’s potential</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankar highlighted cross-border payments as a key area where CBDCs could have a transformative effect. “In the cross-border space, there is absolutely no improvement as such. It still takes four to five days for settlement and five to six per cent cost of transaction. To solve this problem, we believe CBDC is the answer,” he noted.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCBDCs, he added, have “certain unique use cases where bank money can’t solve the problem of transactions.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tRBI reiterates tough stance on cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn cryptocurrencies, Sankar reiterated the RBI’s longstanding view that private digital tokens serve no useful purpose and pose systemic risks, especially for emerging economies. “Our stance on crypto is decided entirely by the way we have analysed and looked at the basic character of cryptos and the purpose they can serve,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Sankar, unbacked cryptocurrencies “have no underlying cash flow, no issuer, therefore no value” and cannot be considered financial assets. On stablecoins, which are backed by underlying reserves, he warned of risks to monetary sovereignty. “Stablecoins carry a huge risk of replacing your currency and policy sovereignty. They do not serve a purpose that can’t be done better with CBDC,” he said, adding that their introduction “will create a lot of policy concerns.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tRupee internationalisation and capital liberalisation</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDrawing a parallel between CBDC development and the internationalisation of the rupee, Sankar said both were long-term strategic goals requiring patient execution. “We want to be a developed country in a very short time. Can you imagine a developed country when your currency is not commonly acceptable for global cross-border trades? We have to build those things now. We have to start the processes now,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There is no element of panic,” he said when asked about the pace of liberalisation in external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and foreign exchange transactions. “Capital account convertibility is a process, not an event. In this spirit, we have been gradually liberalising capital accounts. Most of inward capital flows are by and large liberalised. What remains under control is what goes out.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankar said the RBI’s upcoming proposals on ECBs aim to allow broader access to overseas borrowing while linking limits to leverage ratios instead of blanket cost caps. “Earlier, only financially strong entities could go out and borrow. That affects the cost for everyone else if one of them fails. To address that risk, we are trying to link the amount you can borrow abroad to your leverage. Once we have it, we don’t need to see a cost cap,” he said, adding that a new framework could be announced “in the next couple of months.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMultiple currencies for a stable global system</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that a diversified global monetary system where multiple currencies are used in trade would help reduce global instability. “Many crises happen because of overdependence on one or two currencies. Multiple currencies can ensure a more stable global financial system,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tPayments innovation and regulatory balance</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankar also touched on payments innovation and foreign exchange management, noting that the RBI’s intervention on two-factor authentication was intended as guidance rather than regulation. “Technology evolves, so authentication must also evolve. We said you don’t need to rely only on OTP; you can evolve new factors,” he said.</div></div>",

According to <em>The Guardian</em>, leaked documents reveal that the deal included an extraordinary request from Israel: to use a coded “winking mechanism” to secretly notify officials whenever the companies complied with foreign legal demands for Israeli data.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tSecret alert system for data transfers</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe documents show that the Israeli government wanted the companies to embed hidden signals into payment transactions as covert alerts when data was shared with foreign law enforcement. The system was designed to bypass gag orders that legally prevented the companies from naming the countries involved.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLike other cloud providers, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) regularly cooperate with law enforcement agencies worldwide, providing customer data for investigations. Such exchanges are typically confidential, restricted by court or agency-imposed secrecy rules.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tGoogle, Amazon agreed to Israel’s terms</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBoth Google and Amazon reportedly accepted the “winking mechanism” condition to secure the lucrative Nimbus deal. Israel had long feared losing control over sensitive national data to foreign jurisdictions, prompting officials to mandate this coded system.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAn investigation by <em>The Guardian</em>, in collaboration with Israeli-Palestinian outlet +972 Magazine and Local Call, revealed that the companies accepted “strict and unusual controls” imposed by Israel. However, both firms have denied violating any international legal obligations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tHow the ‘winking mechanism’ worked</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe leaked final version of the Nimbus agreement outlines that the code would take the form of “special compensation” payments to Israel within 24 hours of a data transfer. Each payment corresponded to the telephone dialling code of the requesting foreign country — ranging from 1,000 to 9,999 shekels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor example:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf US authorities requested data, the companies would pay 1,000 shekels (for +1).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor Italy (+39), they would transfer 3,900 shekels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf no hint could legally be given about the country, a flat payment of 100,000 shekels (about $30,000) was to be made.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe Nimbus agreement: Israel’s data sovereignty project</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNamed after towering cloud formations, Project Nimbus is a cornerstone of Israel’s cloud modernisation strategy. It aims to migrate public sector and military data into privately operated data centres within Israel.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe seven-year deal, with an option for renewal, bars Google and Amazon from limiting or revoking Israeli access to their cloud infrastructure, even if the government’s actions conflict with company policies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOfficials inserted such clauses fearing that the companies might withdraw services under employee or shareholder pressure, especially over alleged human rights violations in Palestinian territories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tSafeguards against foreign and corporate interference</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsraeli officials also feared potential vulnerabilities to foreign legal actions tied to how their data or AI systems were used during military operations in the West Bank or Gaza.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Nimbus contract thus prevents unilateral suspension of services, a clause that gained renewed attention after Microsoft recently cut off an Israeli military system used for surveillance of Palestinian communications. Microsoft had competed for the Nimbus contract but reportedly refused certain government demands.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tTech giants under scrutiny amid Gaza war</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSince the Gaza conflict escalated, Google and Amazon’s role in Project Nimbus has come under sharp scrutiny.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring Israel’s military operations, UN investigators accused Israel of potential war crimes, noting that its defence forces relied heavily on advanced cloud computing for data analysis and surveillance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOne intelligence database, containing intercepted Palestinian phone calls, was reportedly hosted on Microsoft Azure until August 2024, when data began shifting to Amazon Web Services.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

A key demand relates to tax certainty for global data-centre players looking to invest in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTax certainty for data-centre investors</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe chamber said the government should ensure that foreign entities availing data-centre services from India are not treated as having a business connection, significant economic presence (SEP), or permanent establishment in the country.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Setting up an approved data centre requires significant long-term investment. Given the size and scale, availability of land and necessary resources, there is a huge opportunity for India to attract investments from large digital players to set up DCs in India through their subsidiaries or affiliates,” it noted, warning that lack of clarity could deter multinational investment.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that Indian subsidiaries providing such services should get a safe-harbour regime with prescribed margins, given the long gestation period for data-centre projects. Safe-harbour should be effective from the date of operationalisation and applicable for at least 15 years, the chamber argued, adding that costs related to foreign affiliates’ technology or data stored in India should be excluded while computing margins.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSEP relief and easing of business rules</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn easing business rules for digital firms, Assocham sought removal of non-digital transactions such as import of goods from the scope of SEP, saying the provision currently casts too wide a net and could force Indian businesses to deduct tax even where the non-resident has no physical or digital presence in India.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt urged the government to issue attribution guidelines and exempt taxpayers eligible for treaty benefits from SEP reporting, stating that “consequently, any Indian resident who makes payments to non-residents who have SEP in India may be obligated to withhold tax prior to making payment to such non-residents,” which creates uncertainty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTax-neutral reorganisation and mergers</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo support domestic reorganisation, the chamber asked that fast-track mergers and demergers under the Companies Act be granted tax neutrality, arguing that a blanket denial compels companies to avail the NCLT route only and renders the fast-track route futile.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also pushed for expanding tax-neutral treatment to all forms of entity conversions and for allowing loss carry-forward under such restructurings. These should be simplified and expanded to enable businesses and investors to optimise their operations and holdings without facing tax costs, it said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRevival of concessional corporate tax rate</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn manufacturing, Assocham urged the government to revive the 15 per cent concessional corporate tax regime for new units to sustain investments. This, it said, will enable India to remain attractive for new capital investment, boost the domestic economy, and encourage exports.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTax exemption for IBC loan waivers</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAddressing stressed-asset resolutions, the chamber sought exemption for loan waivers granted under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), stressing that taxing waived debt “goes contrary to the purpose behind the IBC.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also requested clarity on depreciation for assets partly used for business and asked that write-offs of receivables be excluded from TDS under Section 194R, stating that requiring tax deduction on irrecoverable amounts is “doubly onerous” for creditors.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRelief for farmers and small entrepreneurs</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor small entrepreneurs and the agriculture ecosystem, Assocham argued that farmers and farmer-producer organisations should be exempt from TDS on e-commerce transactions, and platforms merely facilitating trades should not face a levy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt said the current rule imposes an undue burden on farmers, especially where platforms do not handle billing or collection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSubsidy alignment and employment incentives</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe chamber also sought alignment of tax treatment of government subsidies with actual cash receipt to ease liquidity pressure on companies, observing that “actual receipt generally takes two to three years.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo spur hiring, it proposed raising the salary threshold for claiming deduction on new employees to ₹50,000 per month and extending the incentive to contractual workers, saying employment generation is a key issue for the country and the limits fixed in 2016 are outdated.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTransfer pricing and dispute resolution</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn transfer pricing, Assocham urged restoration of the earlier definition of associated enterprises, warning that the current language could trigger disputes merely on account of participation in management or capital.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFinally, the chamber made a strong pitch for speeding up dispute adjudication and widening safe harbours. Advance rulings should be delivered within defined timelines, it said, while seeking broader coverage for safe harbours and raising the limit for the Dispute Resolution Committee from ₹10 lakh to ₹50 lakh to encourage more small taxpayers to opt for it.</div></div>",

Nearly 90–95 per cent are oestrogen receptor-positive and usually human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, because men’s breast tissue is smaller, cancers tend to grow centrally and are noticed later. “These factors favour good treatment response,” Dr Zamre explains, “but late presentation worsens survival.
