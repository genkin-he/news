The three astronauts on Shenzhou 21 will enter the Tianhe core module of the space station.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe crew includes pilot and mission commander Zhang Lu, who also was on the Shenzhou 15 mission to the space station two years ago.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe other two are flying for the first time. Wu Fei, 32, an engineer, is the country's youngest astronaut to join a spaceflight. Zhang Hongzhang is a payload specialist who was a researcher focusing on new energy and new materials before becoming an astronaut.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tZhang said the team would turn the space station into a utopia by doing tai-chi, gardening and appreciating poetry on the Tiangong space station. Like those before them, they will stay at the station for roughly six months.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile in space, the astronauts planned to conduct 27 scientific and applied projects in biotechnology, aerospace medicine, materials science and other areas.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFor the first time, China is sending mice to its space station. Four in total, two males and two females, will be monitored to study how weightlessness and confinement affect their behavioral patterns, said Han Pei, an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This will help us master key technologies for the breeding and monitoring of small mammals in space and make a preliminary assessment of the mice's emergency responses and adaptive changes in space environments, Han said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe space mice were selected from 300 candidates after more than 60 days of intensive training, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency. State media China National Radio reported that the mice are expected to stay five to seven days in the space station and hitch a ride in Shenzhou 20 coming back to Earth.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina's space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of the nation's technological advances over the past two decades. China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tZhang Jingbo, a spokesperson for the China Manned Space Agency, said the research and development work is progressing smoothly for the agency's plans to send an astronaut to the moon.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOur fixed goal of China landing a person on the moon by 2030 is firm, Zhang said at a news conference a day ahead of the launch.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace, space station has helped make China a major player in space. It was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over US national security concerns.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina's space programme is controlled by the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a collaboration with Pakistan, China is in the process of choosing two Pakistani astronauts to come to China for training. The space agency's plan is to send one of them on a short-term mission as a payload expert, in what would be the first visit to the space station by a foreign astronaut.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Trump was interviewed by CBS' Norah O'Donnell Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine. But he has signalled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place.

He hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tParamount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss reportedly had a role in booking the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and aide Steve Witkoff for a 60 Minutes interview two weeks ago, talking about the peace deal in Gaza.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFlying back from the Middle East on Oct 12, Trump told reporters that Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great.

He and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe adminstration's policies have faced pushback in the courts as trans troops and their supporters say they have proven their worth to the military, but the US Supreme Court in May allowed the ban to be enforced while legal challenges proceed.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new memo, which advocates say was only made available to troops last week, also sets up an additional hurdle of requiring that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth and if they fail to do so, their absence can be used against them.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe policy and specifically the uniform mandate will force a lot of people not to be able to attend their separation board hearings, according to Emily Starbuck Gerson, a spokeswoman for SPARTA Pride, an advocacy group for transgender troops and veterans.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey're already essentially being rigged with a predetermined outcome and then now you're further penalizing someone for not showing up because they can't wear the wrong uniform, Gerson added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen asked about the memo, Pentagon assistant press secretary Riley Podleski said that as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe policy follows an Air Force directive reported by The Associated Press in August, which said separation boards could not independently decide whether to keep or discharge transgender troops and instead must recommend separation of the member if they have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria when a person's biological sex does not match up with their gender identity.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerson said the new policy that applies to all the services feels very similar to what the Air Force rolled out but noted that some of the additional hurdles like the uniform mandate were alarming.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe October memo says, should the Service member not conform to uniform and grooming standards, board proceedings will continue with the Service member in absentia and may, as appropriate, take the Service member's failure to comply with standards intro consideration when determining whether the basis for separation has been established.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMany transgender troops have been serving for years and likely don't own uniforms in the gender assigned to them at birth. And they say forcing them into those uniforms would feel wrong.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLogan Ireland, a master sergeant in the Air Force with 15 years of service, said he has been seen as a man for most of his adult life and for almost 13 years of his military service.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt would be a betrayal of what the military has seen me as, he said, adding that it would be like a costume-like effect.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIreland, like almost all other transgender troops, is on administrative leave, and he is sporting a long beard.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCan I put on a skirt or wear the female dress uniform? Sure, yes. ... But does that reflect who I am and what I appear to be on a daily basis? No, and it just creates a lot of confusion, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerson, the advocate, says the new policy seems to run counter to the ideal of a merit-based military that Hegseth has touted.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It does not account for the service member's career history, accomplishments, training and the necessity to their field, she said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIreland also noted that the policy \"denies us the dignity and respect we were promised as we are forced out of a service that once honoured our contributions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe boards traditionally offer troops who are facing separation from the military a chance at a quasi-legal hearing to determine if that service member still has value to the military and should stay on. Fellow service members hear evidence of whatever wrongdoing occurred and about the person's character, fitness and performance.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile not a formal court hearing, it has much the same structure. Service members are often represented by lawyers, they can present evidence in their defense and they can appeal the board's findings to a federal court.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Pentagon's policy on separating officers notes that they are entitled to fair and impartial hearings that should be a forum for the officer concerned to present reasons the contemplated action should not be taken.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis impartial nature means that the boards can sometimes reach surprising conclusions. For example, the commanding officer of the USS McCain, a destroyer that collided with an oil tanker in the Pacific in 2017, killing 10, was not recommended for separation in 2019.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMore recently, the three active duty Marines who were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, were also retained.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPriya Rashid, a military lawyer who has represented service members before hundreds of separation boards, said the fact that commanders can override this process for trans troops subverts justice.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tService members who are accused of serious misconduct, violent misconduct, sex-based misconduct ... are being afforded more due process protections and more rights and entitlements than this group of people solely based on the administrative label of gender dysphoria, she said.</p><p></p></div>",

Interior Minister Guillermo Cataln followed suit on Friday.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRiding high off his party's surprise landslide win in Sunday's legislative elections and $40 billion in pledged funds from a friendly Trump administration, Milei announced that his main spokesperson, Manuel Adorni an ideological defender of the president's agenda known for his combative press conferences littered with sarcastic one-liners would replace the even-tempered Francos as Cabinet chief.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMany far-right supporters of Milei's anti-establishment platform viewed Francos, who hails from Argentina's traditional political elite, with suspicion. But political rivals and lawmakers hostile to Milei's agenda considered him a confidant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrancos was appointed chief of staff last year as the irascible political outsider sought help from the seasoned negotiator in persuading Congress to pass wide-ranging economic overhaul measures to trim the fiscal budget and spur foreign investment. Before his promotion, Francos served as interior minister, charged with managing Milei's tense relations with provinces opposed to the government's budget cuts.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMilei thanked Francos in a statement for his service to the nation during these last two years of profound reforms that required continuous dialogue with various political forces.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said that, starting on Monday, Adorni would assume the role of chief of staff in response to their party's resounding victory that surpassed pollsters' expectations, injected energy into faltering reforms and gave their scrappy libertarian party the numbers it needed in Congress to defend presidential vetoes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis change responds to the election results, the need to renew political dialogue and the beginning of this second phase, Milei said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough Milei's La Libertad Avanza bloc has boosted its numbers in Congress enough to prevent the left-leaning opposition from passing spending measures that undermine fiscal austerity, the party still lacks a majority.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTo see through his free-market overhaul of Argentina's economy, Milei has acknowledged the need to build alliances with centrist parties and win over influential provincial governors.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTop of the agenda will be liberalizing Argentina's labour market and simplifying its byzantine tax system big goals that have vexed right-wing governments before. To show his openness to dialogue, Milei welcomed 20 of Argentina's 24 governors to the presidential headquarters on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe four governors excluded from the meeting represented Peronism, the populist opposition movement widely blamed for delivering the economic shambles that Milei inherited in the 2023.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a TV interview with a local channel late Thursday, Mieli defended his decision to leave out the Peronist governors, saying, It's very hard to have a reasonable dialogue.

His ventures operated across the US, Europe, and Asia, projecting themselves as reliable intermediaries in global telecom infrastructure.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBefore the scandal, Brahmbhatt was regarded as a successful non-resident Indian (NRI) businessman with offices in Garden City, New York, and links to investment entities Carriox Capital II and BB Capital SPV.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tAllegations of a multi-year fraud</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to court filings by HPS and other lenders, Brahmbhatt and his companies created fake invoices, forged emails, and fabricated contracts to obtain loans. The fraud involved asset-based financing, where future customer payments are pledged as collateral.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestigators allege that the companies even built fake websites resembling legitimate telecom clients to mislead auditors and lenders. Further checks revealed that every email used to verify invoices in the past two years was fake, and falsified documents dated back to 2018.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tHow the scheme was uncovered</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe fraud came to light in July 2024, when an HPS employee spotted irregularities in customer email addresses during an audit. Upon cross-verification, major Belgian telecom company BICS confirmed it had no dealings with Bridgevoice, describing the emails as a “confirmed fraud attempt.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSubsequent investigation by Deloitte and CBIZ confirmed that the customer data, invoices, and contracts were fabricated, exposing a sophisticated, multi-year deception.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tBrahmbhatt files for bankruptcy</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter being confronted by lenders, Brahmbhatt reportedly stopped responding to calls and emails. Investigators visiting his New York offices found them locked and deserted, with his home abandoned and several luxury cars left outside.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSources cited by<em> The Wall Street Journal </em>said Brahmbhatt may have relocated to India or Mauritius.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBy August 2024, his companies — Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, Carriox Capital II, and BB Capital SPV — had all filed for bankruptcy, followed by Brahmbhatt’s personal bankruptcy on August 12, 2024.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHPS’s exposure reportedly rose from $385 million in 2021 to $430 million by the time of the collapse. BNP Paribas, a co-financier, is said to have set aside $220 million in provisions linked to the case.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBrahmbhatt’s lawyer has denied wrongdoing, calling the allegations “misplaced” and maintaining that the business was legitimate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFallout for BlackRock and lenders</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAlthough the alleged fraud involves over half a billion dollars, the impact on BlackRock’s balance sheet is considered limited. HPS manages about $179 billion in assets, making the potential loss “manageable,” the report said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the incident has triggered a review of due diligence and verification processes across BlackRock’s private-credit portfolio, as lenders reassess safeguards around asset-backed loans.</div></div>",
