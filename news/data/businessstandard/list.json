The sources did not say who the sellers were.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside working hours.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe refiner had previously cancelled seven or eight cargoes of Russian oil after the announcement of the latest US sanctions as they were supplied by subsidiaries of sanctioned entities, two sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore the latest US sanctions, Rosneft was a major seller of ESPO oil.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMost Russian ESPO crude from the Pacific port of Kozmino has typically gone to China. However, demand from China has dropped after state refiners suspended purchases following US sanctions, while Chinese independent refineries have exhausted their import quotas. As a result, the price of ESPO crude has declined, making it attractive for Indian buyers.</p><p></p></div>",

The brokerage noted that over the past decade, the company has built a sustainable moat through full-spectrum capabilities across multiple dosage forms and a track record of successful speciality projects. Additionally, the company has developed robust manufacturing capacities, maintained a consistent compliance record in supplying to US markets, and focused on commercial success.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tConsidering a strong earnings CAGR of 43 per cent over FY25-28 and over 30 per cent RoE (adjusted for recent fresh issue), analysts at MOFSL believe Rubicon should command a premium valuation. \"Rubicon scores well ahead of peers in pharma space on ROE*earnings CAGR matrix,\" the brokerage said. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL values Rubicon Research at a 35x multiple (30 per cent premium to the sector multiple of 27x) on 12-month forward earnings, arriving at a target price of ₹740. The target implies a 21 per cent upside from Friday's closing price of ₹609.8. </div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\tAt 10:45 AM on Friday, the Rubicon Research stock was trading at ₹624, up over 2.3 per cent compared to the previous session's close of ₹609.8 on the NSE. The recently listed company's total market capitalisation stood at ₹10,232 crore.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHere's why Motilal Oswal holds a positive outlook on Rubicon Research:</h3>\n<h3>\r\n\tRubicon scales despite US generics headwinds </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL noted that despite challenges in the US generics market, including consolidation of buyers, faster ANDA approvals, increasing competition, and rising adverse inspection outcomes, Rubicon has scaled its business significantly, growing revenue from ₹390 million in FY15 to ₹12.8 billion in FY25, supported by focused R&amp;D, streamlined manufacturing, and strong compliance.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tScaled up portfolio with faster launches</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage further highlighted that Rubicon has rapidly expanded its commercial product portfolio from 18 in FY22 to 70 by June 2025, achieving an 86.4 per cent conversion rate from approvals to launches in Q1FY26. The company’s offerings span oral solids, oral liquids, nasal sprays, and topicals, with oral solids revenue growing at a 57 per cent CAGR to ₹11 billion over FY22–25, and oral liquids scaling from ₹43 million to ₹1.3 billion. In Q1FY26, OS/OL revenue rose 7 per cent/25 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹3 billion/₹355 million, while nasal spray revenue reached ₹124 million/₹80 million in FY25/Q1FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, Rubicon’s ₹2.8 billion R&amp;D spend over FY24–Q1FY26 supports ongoing product filings, including six ANDAs filed and six approvals in Q1FY26, underpinning strong revenue visibility through FY25–28.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNasal sprays are emerging as a key growth driver for Rubicon, contributing 2.3 per cent of revenue in Q1FY26, supported by its Ambernath facility. The US nasal spray market is set to grow at a 9.5 per cent CAGR through 2030, and Rubicon stands out with four of the 25 approvals granted between CY23 and June 2025.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRubicon’s CNS playbook</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to MOFSL, Rubicon is expanding its CNS business with three branded products - Equetro, Raldesy, and Lopressor OS—that have no AB-rated generic competitors as of July 2025. Equetro is FDA-approved for bipolar I disorder, Raldesy offers a novel oral liquid formulation of Trazodone for depression, and Lopressor OS provides flexible dosing for heart conditions. Increased focus on marketing to drive better business prospects in this segment for Rubicon.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tEnhanced focus on R&amp;D</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tRubicon’s R&amp;D spending stands at 11 per cent of revenue, significantly higher than the industry median of 6 per cent, highlighting its strategy to develop a broad product portfolio. The company also shows strong efficiency, generating one of the highest R&amp;D turnovers among peers, with US revenues from R&amp;D investments made two years ago. \"With FY25 US revenue nearly 6x its FY22-23 R&amp;D expenditure, Rubicon’s disciplined product selection and development approach is delivering solid results,\" MOFSL said.</div></div>",

He described it as \"the cherry on the icing of the cake\", adding that Tesla’s main focus is on products with a broader impact on sustainable energy.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMusk said the Roadster’s design was nearing completion and promised it would be \"something spectacular\", indicating that production was planned for 2025.

Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015 but left the company in 2018, has often criticised both OpenAI and Altman, saying they have moved away from the group’s original goal of keeping research open to everyone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn recent months, the two have exchanged several sharp remarks. Musk has also filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI. According to Bloomberg, Musk’s lawyer recently said they plan to continue the legal fight, criticising officials in California and Delaware for not stopping OpenAI’s shift into a for-profit company.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

The lineup remains the company’s biggest moneymaker, accounting for roughly half of its revenue. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/industry/news/apple-india-all-time-revenue-record-september-quarter-2025-125103100266_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple India hits record revenue in September quarter on strong iPhone sales</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tApple shares gained more than 4 per cent in late trading. They had been up 8.4 per cent this year through the close.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 27, sales rose 7.9 per cent to $102.5 billion. That slightly beat the $102.2 billion average estimate. Earnings rose to $1.85 a share, topping the average estimate of $1.77.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Cupertino, California-based company benefited from stronger-than-expected services growth in the period, helping offset a slowdown in China. The Mac and wearables division also performed better than anticipated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTariffs added $1.1 billion in expenses during the quarter, in line with Apple’s expectations. The company expects $1.4 billion in tariff costs in the December period. Operating expenses will range from $18.1 billion to $18.5 billion. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRevenue from greater China fell 3.6 per cent to $14.5 billion last quarter, well short of the $16.4 billion that analysts projected. The company faces mounting competition from local smartphone providers and has struggled to offer artificial intelligence features in the country. Still, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said he believes Apple will return to growth in the region during the current quarter. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRevenue from the iPhone gained 6.1 per cent to $49 billion in the September period, helped by the new models. Still, that was just short of the $49.3 billion that analysts projected. Apple said it faced supply constraints, which may have limited growth. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe quarter included roughly two weeks of iPhone 17 availability, and initial demand appeared strong — with sellouts reported across Apple retail stores and third-party channels. Most buyers opted for higher-end iPhone 17 Pro models, helping boost Apple’s average selling price. The $999 iPhone Air — more expensive than the model it replaced — also helped on this front.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tServices remained Apple’s fastest-growing segment last quarter, with revenue rising 15 per cent to $28.8 billion. Analysts had anticipated $28.2 billion.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tDespite the healthy growth, the services business continues to face challenges from regulators seeking to change App Store policies, which could affect software and subscription revenue. However, Apple secured a recent legal victory when a judge declined to dismantle its $20 billion-a-year search deal with Alphabet Inc.’s Google.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tMac revenue increased 13 per cent to $8.73 billion, topping the $8.6 billion average projection. The company refreshed its MacBook Air and Mac Studio lines in March and released a new entry-level MacBook Pro earlier this month.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tThe iPad business, meanwhile, introduced new low-end and Air models in March and updated a Pro version this month.
