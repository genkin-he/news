Before that, some of the finest Indian judges came from a system in which the executive had, in theory, complete freedom to appoint judges,\" the former solicitor general said.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral \"fiercely independent judges\" were appointed by the government of the day, he said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"But then things started going wrong. We fixed it, and I was part of the legal system which fought to take away this power from the executive, but it was a band-aid. It was not a solution. And in hindsight, I think it is about time we correct the folly we made,\" the senior advocate said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSalve said India was the only country which had changed governments with the ballot, and not the bullet and that showed the success of the Constitution and the democracy.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe lawyer, however, there are still challenges which lie ahead, and there is a need for judicial reforms and restoring the independence of the civil service.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe underlined the need for \"coequal institutions\", like Parliament and the Election Commission, to be respected, and said that he was \"distressed\" to see the EC officials summoned by the apex court.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We must always remember that Parliament is a coequal institution. The Election Commission is a coequal institution. In recent times, I was distressed to see the way the Supreme Court summons the Election Commission and talks rudely towards officers,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Of course, you (Supreme Court) have the power of judicial review if you find something wrong. (But) Do not disrespect them.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"What happens when you call them (co-equal institutions) to account on the basis of a false set of facts presented to you, you let the person who has disrespected a coequal institution say, 'Oh, naughty boy, go away from here. Do not do it again.' Would you have taken the same soft approach if somebody had done the same to you as an institution? You are a high office, and double standards do not go together,\" Salve said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe cited the example of the United Kingdom's judicial reforms, where the judges were appointed by the judicial panel selected by the judicial commission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"And I am always challenged as to, well, if you have this (a judicial appointment commission), who is going to select (members of) the commission? And my answer is, if as 1.4 billion Indians, we can't find seven honest people to appoint judges, shame on us and calling us a democracy,\" Salve said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Why cannot the four or five big functionaries, the speakers of Parliament, the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister of India, members of the opposition, senior members of the opposition, constitute a panel. Who will select a panel? Can't we find seven independent Indians out of 1.4 billion, and leave it to them to select judges on merit?\" he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe process of judicial appointment must be transparent, Salve said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"How is it a transparent process? Not by saying you must publish what you discuss in that little Collegium of yours and destroy reputations of your own and those of those whom you select and do not select. But in the UK, for example, it is by invitation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"So, whenever there is a vacancy, you advertise you receive. What you have received is in the public domain. How you select is not, because that then becomes a criticism of why you have not chosen. One over the other. This is one of the biggest challenges to our judiciary,\" the lawyer, who represented India at the International Court of Justice at the Hague in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the overreach of the judiciary, the senior advocate said, \"Judicial nudges are good. Do not let it become a judicial sledgehammer.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Salve said he was worried about the judiciary's \"control\" over the elected executive under the veil of accountability, by entertaining ill-conceived public interest litigations against people in public life, devastating their careers.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"That is not what the Supreme Court was meant for. It was not meant to do a magistrate's job to oversee investigations,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSalve said the 1975 Emergency was the only time in the history of India when the rule of law was \"seriously threatened.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> He said that the day the citizenry developed apathy, it created a crisis, a kind that he said he has been witnessing in the current Europe.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Europe today is going through a crisis because I have seen the generation of a successful, hard-working post-World War II generation who built Europe into a powerhouse, give way to a generation which was well-fed, well-nurtured and without a fire in their belly. Europe has to reinvent itself. We in India are much ahead in the race,\" Salve said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe asked the students to embrace globalisation as it would open opportunities to conquer the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I have faith in Indians. I have faith in your minds. I have the privilege of working in so many jurisdictions, and I dare say, and yes, of course, I am biased in favour of India, but I say India has amongst the finest minds,\" Salve said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

The rise was driven by sustained demand for both compact cars and SUVs, aided by GST reforms that reduced prices ahead of the festive season.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRetail sales, however, outpaced wholesales as vehicles continued to move swiftly out of showrooms. While final numbers are being collated, industry insiders estimate that retail sales reached around 600,000 units in October.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMaruti Suzuki India posted its highest-ever monthly dispatches in its 40-year history at 180,675 units, including light commercial vehicles.

Other strong performers included the Ertiga (23,429 units), Dzire (28,000 units), Swift (24,348 units), WagonR (24,193 units) and Baleno (23,000 units). The Eeco, with 18,207 units, also had one of its best-ever months. Banerjee noted that Brezza sales were affected by some production constraints, with retail at 17,847 units in October.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMaruti’s overall PV dispatches rose 10.48 per cent year-on-year to 176,318 units in October.

Between Navratri and Diwali, Tata Motors delivered 100,000 vehicles, a 33 per cent increase year-on-year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHyundai Motor India reported dispatches of 53,792 units, down 3 per cent, while exports stood at 16,102 units. “October 2025 was a month driven by the festivals of Dussehra, Dhanteras and Diwali, further complemented by the positive impact of GST 2.0 reforms,” said Tarun Garg, Whole-time Director and COO, Hyundai Motor India. He added that the company achieved its second-highest ever combined monthly sales for the Creta and Venue, with 30,119 units sold.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tM&amp;M said it achieved its highest-ever monthly SUV sales in October at 71,264 units, a 31 per cent year-on-year increase. “October was a record month for us, driven by strong SUV demand,” said Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, Automotive Division, M&amp;M.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJapanese automaker Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) reported a 43 per cent year-on-year jump in sales to 40,257 units in October. “The recently introduced festive editions of the Urban Cruiser Hyryder Aero Edition and the 2025 Fortuner Leader Edition have received tremendous appreciation for their unique styling and premium value proposition,” said Varinder Wadhwa, Vice President (Sales, Service &amp; Used Car Business) at TKM.
