But one thing I will tell you, where India has a big, big advantage, is that we are built for the VUCA world. We are able to take uncertainty in our strength, and still go ahead. The biggest test of that, by the way, is something that we don't mention at all these days, it was demonetisation. It was the biggest test, and we passed it with flying colours,” said Bhattacharya.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShe was responding to a question from Prajakt Deolasee, chief technology officer, Turtlemint, on how India can wade in a global scenario when the majority of tech supply chains are controlled by US firms.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShe added: “This world is full of uncertainty. Every day there will be some uncertainty coming, but I think we are more than capable of taking that on, which is a great thing. Because there are a lot of other countries that cannot manage such uncertainty.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tResponding to a query from Puneet Asthana, executive director and CTO, Shriman Wealth and Shriram Group’s Capital Market Businesses on Large Language Model (LLMs), Bhattacharya said: “I am not seeing generation of a lot of in-house LLMs. But people are trying to make out how they can reduce the cost of using the LLMs that are currently there. So, whether it is in-house or whether they will be given by the current, established players or new players themselves, has to be seen. There is a very big effort to reduce costs, because unless you reduce it, you have too few users.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“It is not going to provide you the kind of sustenance, nor give any legs to the kind of valuations that you have at the end of the day. If you are going to justify those valuations, most people in the world use them,” Bhattacharya said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShe said that without reducing the costs, valuations of these companies cannot be justified beyond a point. “Otherwise, there is no way that those valuations can be justified beyond a point, and most people in the world won't be able to use them unless the costs come down.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn concerns raised by Mahavir Jindal, COO of Amazon Pay, about the valuation that companies are drawing, Bhattacharya said the euphoria is not warranted. “So, I will not speak about valuations. I'll leave that to the experts. I will say this much only that while there seems to be a hell of a lot of euphoria, you need to be grounded. The euphoria may not be warranted, but serious looking into it and serious partaking of it is warranted” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

In a conversation with <strong>Nivedita Mookerji</strong> at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Summit 2025, she warns that no organisation can survive without a robust information-technology (IT) backbone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you look at the world of technology after coming from SBI, and it has been five years at Salesforce now?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven at the bank, I strongly believed that any organisation not taking IT seriously will not sustain itself. Whether you’re a small family-run shop or in HR, logistics, manufacturing, or services — a strong IT backbone is essential. Technology is evolving at an unprecedented speed. We are now working with Agentic AI, and in just 13 months we have covered enormous ground, enabling Agentic enterprises. The pace of change is extraordinary, even within tech.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>From the world of SBI to this speed of technology, how has the transition been?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSBI teaches you to lead while learning. Because you’re transferred often — to different locations and across verticals and teams — you learn on your feet. I used to say that once I found a good hairdresser and tailor for my saree blouses, it was time to be transferred! This environment prepares you to add value immediately, which helped me in transitioning from 40 years in banking to working with people five generations younger.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>If you were to describe your journey as a woman leader, how would you put it?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI never thought of it in a precise way. For a woman in India with a career, it’s a constant calibration between family responsibilities and work. There are moments when you wonder if it’s worth it, but you must accept the reality and still move forward. Many women ask if I faced difficulty getting junior male colleagues to listen. I didn’t. Either I was lucky or any comments never reached me. I think what worked was my ability to communicate in a way that excited them as much as it did me. When people are convinced and energised, the gender of the leader doesn’t matter.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you share a few things you did for your women colleagues, apart from allowing sabbaticals?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe sabbatical was one, and I hoped other public-sector banks would follow, though they haven’t yet. I still hope they do, because it’s very helpful. I noticed many women were in platform roles, not in branch operations like their male colleagues. To qualify for the next promotion, they needed two years in an independent role and two years in rural service. Yet, in rural areas, landlords wouldn’t rent premises to single women. So, we identified rural branches women could commute to, or we rented accommodation in the bank’s name with multiple rooms for women branch managers. Many opted for these roles, and some told me those shared years were the best of their lives.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe also implemented cervical-cancer vaccination for all women staffers and their wards. And I tried to ensure that in major centres, we had at least one lady doctor — a gynaecologist or paediatrician — so women didn’t have to spend time outside arranging appointments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>There was a time when we had many woman CEOs across banks. Not any longer. What happened?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen I left, I left behind a strong pipeline of women, many of whom have achieved a lot. My former chief financial officer (CFO) is now CFO of the World Bank. Another headed Indian Bank and later NSDL. Women who were deputy managing director then have gone on to lead in several places. The glass ceiling still exists and takes time and effort to break. We were fortunate to have a strong cohort across PSBs, private and foreign banks. I recall a reception hosted by Raghuram Rajan (who was Reserve Bank of India governor from 2013 to 2016) — there were more sarees than suits in the room!</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>As a banker earlier, how do you look at the banking universe today from the outside?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator plays a significant role. The sector’s challenges today are different. One of the biggest now is technology — how banks use it to deliver better services, and how they reconcile the fact that work done by people can now be done by digital agents that can think, generate, and act. Banks must leverage tech to reach the last mile — to 600,000 villages where financial literacy is still lacking but crucial for unlocking India’s potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBFSI is the most digitally mature sector, so it must absorb new technology and use it daily to deliver the best to customers and show the way for other industries.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>During your SBI tenure, you took steps to bring in technology. SBI was called a “Smart Bank”. Looking back, could you have done more?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe did what we could at that time. Many things available today weren’t available then. When YONO launched, it was far ahead of private or foreign banks. The risk-management techniques we put in place, tech for credit underwriting, reaching the right customers through inclusion efforts, and the range of products — we pushed the envelope. With hindsight, perhaps we could have focused more on agility. You can’t be agile and nimble when you are working with systems that are very stodgy and are rooted in the past, which are a lot of legacy. You can’t write off all technical debt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Other than technology, was there any other unfinished business?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCustomer service will always remain a work in progress because expectations keep rising. Take technology: Customers want safety, but if we add multiple login layers, they complain; if login is easier, they worry about risk. We could have done better with customer literacy — explaining safety measures while retaining convenience. Every stakeholder, including the regulator, has a role.</div></div>",

The exemptions will help reduce insurance premiums, enhance affordability, and signal the government’s strong focus on insurance as an essential life necessity, the chiefs of four life insurance companies said at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a session moderated by <em>Manojit Saha</em> of <em>Business Standard</em>, Ratnakar Patnaik, managing director (MD) of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), said: “I agree this (GST exemption) will help insurance grow, it will become affordable. But at the same time, GST waiver alone will not help to increase penetration as such. It will surely facilitate it, but by itself is not sufficient to increase the penetration levels.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn early September, the GST Council announced a tax exemption on all individual life and health insurance policies, and their reinsurance was also exempted to boost penetration.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“It will surely help to bring down prices and increase penetration. Insurance is not a product which people will stand up tomorrow and buy. I would say for some time in September, it did happen. For a few days it did happen. That is a good indicator. But we will have to keep this alive in the mind of the customer, ensure that we take it to every household, let them know the benefits of bringing the prices down and increasing the sum insured,” said Tarun Chugh, MD &amp; CEO, Bajaj Life Insurance.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe insurers said that along with the GST waiver, they would need to educate people and inform them about improved affordability. Before the waiver, GST was a significant part of the cost, mainly for protection plans. There was a need to tell people about the enhanced affordability after the GST relief. Further, to increase penetration, there was a need for product innovation, more cross selling opportunities, and changes in distribution.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInsurers also believe that GST cuts have provided a great opportunity to boost the sale of protection products while also providing other value added services.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Mahesh Balasubramanian, MD &amp; CEO, Kotak Life Insurance, “As regards converting from a push product to a pull product, in every financial services business, there has been one lead product, which is the customer acquisition engine. I think this is the moment for term insurance. We can use this opportunity to seize the moment and make term insurance as the feeder product, where all of us acquire customers, and then see whether we can cross-sell and up-sell.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnup Bagchi, MD &amp; CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, said: “The excitement and this kind of positive discussion on life insurance with this kind of intensity is happening for the first time. The intensity has come because affordability has improved and it is a massive change...In channels which are not intermediated, which are online, where customers come in, all of us, we are certainly seeing 30-50 per cent increased traffic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFurther, while the insurers deliberated on the opportunities created by the GST waiver, they discussed several measures that have been taken to counter the impact of removal of the input tax credit (ITC). According to the companies, even as the benefits must be passed on to customers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors must bear the impact of the loss equally.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile some of the insurers are in discussions with their distributors on the same, LIC has passed the benefits to customers without making any changes in commissions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The government is sharing much of the burden as well, and so is the sector. There are basically four stakeholders. The prime and the most important is the customer, there is a manufacturer - which is the sector, then there is a distributor and the vendors are the fourth. The vendors provide a lot of services like the staffing units. The sector has shown and acted in unison: that we will not pass on anything negative to the customer. We have absorbed it. But eventually, it will have to be the three other stakeholders who will have to take on. The distributor also has to handle it and discussions are going on,” Chugh said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our priority continues to be the customer and we have passed on the entire benefit to the customer. That has been the approach even today. Secondly, as far as the GST on the commission is concerned, that also the corporation has absorbed. LIC has nearly 15,00,000 agents and many of them depend solely on income generated from life insurance,” Patnaik said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have to pass on the benefits to the customer, which all of us are committed to and already done. So, I think the productivity and efficiency of the industry has to go up. We have to look at all our costs and hope that ‘less is more’ should be the philosophy. So, we will probably take some time to reorganise. I don’t think this can change overnight. It can probably be a 6-12 month process where we look at each of the items and see how we can optimise,” Balasubramanian said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Growth of the industry is the only thing which mitigates all of this. If there is no growth in the industry, GST, no GST, nothing can get absorbed. So, the first thing we have to focus on is how do you give more to the customer. Chota premium, bada cover, turrant issuance, instant settlement. We must also understand that much of our distribution caters to the slightly more affluent part of the population. While, in other industries, growth is coming from alternate distribution. You will see in mutual funds, you know, the online distributors, they have certainly grown very large,” Bagchi said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tIn his first public conversation after taking charge as chairman of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), <strong>Ajay Seth</strong> talks to <strong>Tamal Bandopadhyay</strong> on the impact of reforms in goods and services tax (GST), foreign direct investment (FDI) in insurance, the Bima Sugam initiative, and flexibility in investment norms for insurance companies. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What are your expectations from the industry on GST cuts being passed on to customers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs a regulator, and with this being my first appearance, I would like to state that I have an open mind. Based on data, analysis, and the perspective I have, I reach conclusions. But nothing is done without consultation, discussion, and a consensus. I draw strength from what Parliament has mandated — protect policyholders’ interests and, on the other side of the coin, regulate, promote, and develop insurance in an orderly manner. Orderly development requires building a consensus on any reform. </div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\t\tOn goods and services tax (GST), what the government has signalled is that insurance firms have zero GST, and so do food products (processed). The inference I draw here is that the government is putting insurance in the same category as food, which is essential for life.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNow this is an opportunity for the sector to focus on the consumer. Are we content with serving 10 per cent of our population? No. This is a moment where the government has provided maximum possible support.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFrom the regulator’s side, the question is how we can economise our cost. We have to go from a high-cost structure to a moderate-cost structure, with good service.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn life insurance, 20 per cent of the risk pool is the cost of procuring it and managing it. And that too, a significant part of that risk pool is not really the risk pool. It has a lot of savings too. Think of any financial sector that has a cost of savings and the risk pool is 20 per cent. For non-life it is 30 per cent.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tCommissions to corporate agents vary hugely. The largest life insurer after  Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) spends 4 per cent of its premiums on them, while the second-largest spends 17 per cent despite both getting 50 per cent of their business from this channel. So, GST rationalisation is a great opportunity for the industry to make products more affordable, efficient, and attractive to consumers because unless they see value, the sector cannot grow.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>The industry has gone through multiple shocks in the past few years in the form of tax, change in policies related to expense ratios, surrender charges besides the pandemic. Can it expect some stability now?</strong></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\t\tThe sector, especially health insurance, is at an unstable equilibrium at the moment. On the life side, there is a low-efficiency equilibrium. But other sectors that manage savings of Indians are giving competition to life-insurance companies. So, is the status quo the answer? If you want to live with a low-level equilibrium or an unstable equilibrium, then it is so. But does it require shocks? No. It requires an orderly transition to a better tomorrow.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThere is a lot of improvement that has to be done on the use of capital by insurance companies. The matter that requires the highest attention is distribution.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>When can we expect 100 per cent FDI in the insurance sector?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLegislative changes for 100 per cent FDI will come in due course. But this alone cannot take care of the capital needs of the sector. The industry’s own capital is about ₹3.5 trillion. FDI is welcome. All those who have come in are welcome, and they have contributed. But the significant part is domestic capital. Of the ₹3.5 trillion, FDI is only ₹80,000 crore-90,000 crore. And all is not on the balance sheet of the insurance companies. Some of it has gone to pay previous shareholders. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the regulator looking to tweak investment norms so that long-term insurance funds flows into infrastructure? Currently, an infrastructure project must have an AAA or AA rating to attract insurance funds.</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOf the assets under management (AUM) of ₹75 trillion with the insurance sector, only ₹7.5 trillion is in infrastructure. But are the regulations coming in the way? The answer is “no”. The regulations say insurance companies can invest at least 50 per cent in government securities, and the rest can be in corporate bonds and non-fixed income securities. It is a question of whether both pull and push factors have to work. Today, the industry is looking for good-quality paper. A fair amount of work is needed in terms of the pull factor. As the insurance regulator, it is my job to work closely with the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and governor of the Reserve Bank of India on how we create conditions for a more mature bond market. And here the role of credit-rating agencies becomes important. For example, if an item is rated ‘A’ and there is a deterioration in the quality of the paper, the issue is how quickly the industry gets to know about it and whether there will be a market to make an exit … so this is the pull factor that is required. In insurance, a conversation is needed as to what kind of push can be generated. A regulator cannot say one can invest in a particular product. It is when the consumer says that with a similar kind of risk profile, somebody else can give me X+delta (risk-sensitivity measure), why can you (insurer) not provide it? So, this push is needed. If any guardrails are needed on getting into an area that is less safe, we are ready to look at them.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>How has been the progress of Bima Sugam — the UPI moment for the insurance sector — in the Bima Trinity?</strong> <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe big piece next to distribution reform is digital public infrastructure. And, we have not really made a beginning on that. As the regulator, we see Bima Sugam as an entity that is consumer-facing, and at the back end are the insurance companies. We have made a beginning. The products and services should be coming to the market in the next few quarters.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>When is the insurance industry transitioning to risk-based supervision, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and a risk-based capital framework?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMoving towards IFRS or IndAS (Indian Accounting Standards) is something we should do in about a year. It may not be 100 per cent. But the idea is to bring significant pieces around that and then provide a glide path to others, which may require time to reach there. Everybody will not be ready. Bigger companies will be while smaller ones may take some time.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndAS is one of the enablers of the composite licence. This is a prerequisite. Without transparency on the balance sheet and the P&amp;L (profit and loss) account one cannot get into composite insurance. The second piece of risk-based capital will flow from this. Risk-based capital will help a few companies but will be a challenge for others. So there we have to think about how to provide a glide path or give them a longer period to reach there. But the journey has to begin. The third piece — risk-based supervision — is one on which we have to spend time and I would like to have a conversation on this with the sector. Risk-based supervision needs solid corporate governance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Given that India took leadership in the G20 to push for global regulation — and we now have a kind of blueprint — it’s ironic that 18 G20 nations have some form of regulation, and India doesn’t. It’s time we all came together to create one. It’s not that difficult.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSumit Gupta, cofounder and chief executive officer of CoinDCX, added: “It’s high time we looked at regulations. The best time to regulate was yesterday; the next best is today. If we don’t act now, we’ll lose out. It’s a big risk if we fail to innovate in this sector.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tG Padmanabhan, former executive director of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said the financial sector is inevitably moving towards digitisation and tokenisation, making regulation essential. “The future of finance is digital. The future of finance is tokenisation,” he said. Padmanabhan also noted that while India may have missed its early opportunity in crypto, it cannot afford to ignore stablecoins. “Among International Monetary Fund member countries, nearly 70 per cent are already working on some form of regulation for stablecoins. They believe stablecoin growth will outpace that of crypto,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tS B Seker, head of Asia-Pacific at Binance, said the absence of clear regulation has kept digital assets from becoming a national focus. “India has been a standout leader in digital asset adoption over the past four years. But the country needs to decide its model — there are plenty of global examples to follow,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked whether the sector needs a separate regulatory body, panellists were divided. Seker said outcomes mattered more than structure: “There are two models — Dubai created a separate regulator, while others integrated it into existing systems. As long as there’s a constitutional mandate, a new body isn’t necessary.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPadmanabhan agreed: “Having a separate regulator won’t solve everything. What matters is having the right people with the right attitude to let innovation thrive until issues arise.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the “crypto bus” may have left the station, the panellists agreed that India cannot delay its stance on stablecoins.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChenoy said one of the RBI’s biggest concerns — dollarisation — could be mitigated by a rupee-backed stablecoin. “If you want to address that, look at what the Brics nations did — they created a trade settlement mechanism based on virtual digital assets not linked to the dollar. India didn’t participate. Since we’re the world’s largest remittance market, a rupee-backed stablecoin could cut remittance costs,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPadmanabhan added that from a monetary policy standpoint, India must study stablecoins closely.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“As we speak, around 97 per cent of stablecoins are linked to the US dollar. If that continues, two things could happen: the dollar becomes even more dominant, and our monetary policy weakens,” he warned.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that global stablecoin circulation could reach $2 trillion by 2030, Gupta said:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If we don’t act now, others will internationalise their currencies while India lags. We need to internationalise the rupee.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeker added: “As digital dollars become programmable and interoperable, their global influence will grow. India must make the rupee digitally available to stay competitive.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen it comes to crypto, India faces a peculiar problem: while crypto itself lacks regulatory support, associated technologies like blockchain and Web3 are also getting sidelined.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGupta said unclear rules are driving crypto entrepreneurs abroad. “Running an exchange in India has been a nightmare because of the uncertainty. Ninety per cent of my friends — talented Indian Institute of Technology graduates — have moved overseas. If we’re too late, it’ll be hard to bring that talent back.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChenoy agreed that regulatory delays are costing India both innovation and jobs. “By delaying regulation, we’re putting Indian companies at a disadvantage and pushing them to move overseas,” he said. “A recent study showed that 27 per cent of India’s largest crypto product creators have already relocated abroad.”</div></div>",

There are more and more instances globally in the last two or three months, where non-customer-centric businesses have been hacked.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about customer awareness, Mahavir Jindal, chief operating officer (COO), Amazon Pay India, said it is not easy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that educating customers is going to be a long journey. “It is a journey that we need to start now. We are still at the base layer, where we are still talking about phishing and how to safeguard against this.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMalcolm Gomes, COO at IDfy, also said that there is still a highly vulnerable population which includes the elderly and some who don’t understand mainstream languages.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The basics have been done, but there is a lot more that needs to be done through video and Whatsapp channels. Everyone is doing their fair share. The RBI does, banks do. I still feel it has not got to perhaps the most vulnerable sections of society. That is also where a lot of the source problems are,” Gomes said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAll the three experts also agreed on the urgent need for a zero-trust approach — a model now seen as essential for securing digital ecosystems as regulators demand greater operational transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA zero-trust model treats every user and device as untrusted, requiring continuous verification before granting access to systems or data.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGomes said that zero trust has existed for a while, “It started with the NIST in the US, and the thought process came from there. At this point, regulators have not mandated it, but it has crept into the thought process of organisations.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said it doesn’t help that AI tools are getting much more sophisticated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJindal, too, said, “If someone is in a financial services business, he has to operate in a zero-trust environment,” adding that for him, zero trust is “all-pervasive.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about the threat vectors, which are evolving rapidly, he said zero-trust capabilities must advance in tandem.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that at Amazon Pay, “any data exchange, whether with an external partner or an internal one, happens in a zero-trust environment — implying an exchange of keys.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he believes the industry is doing a decent job implementing zero-trust systems, Jindal warned that the pace of cyber threats continues to accelerate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“While we have a good foundation, there is a long way to go to address the emerging threat vectors,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about cyber security becoming a priority for organisations, Mukherjee said, “For any organisation, there are multiple competing priorities. Needless to say that cyber for most organisations is among the top.”</div></div>",

It restricts UPI transactions in case of theft, hacking, etc. However, companies still have to work on data security,” Gaur said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIswaran said AI engines were improving the correlation of fraudulent patterns, which helps in fraud detection.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, he added, it increases the cost of operations due to which companies can’t reduce merchant discount rate (MDR).</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Once we all work collectively at the device level, technology level, and banking level, and raise red flags based on various parameters and empower the top layer, we can bring down fraud and that would lead to massive savings, which could be passed on to the customer,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tL Guru Raghavendran, senior vice president and product head at Azentio Software, said technology must serve the original purpose of banking while ensuring trust.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Purpose remains the same. But now it happens on a device and technology should support it,” he said, adding that devices now have “450+ parameters to check the authenticity of a transaction and whether it is a fraud\".<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tLooking ahead, Gaur said the future lies in building digital trust.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“From icon-based browsing to voice-based browsing, applications will evolve. Then the cost can also come down, as we won’t need a screen. Evolving from digital reach to digital trust is important. The next 300-400 million people would transact digitally when they feel secure. We are working on how we can build trust,” he said. </div></div>",
