China's dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives, Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the paper, Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for the US industry, particularly in emerging markets. The forum, he said, focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US stakeholders are concerned about China's growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted that Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy- and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US underinvestment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Atlantic Council warned that these supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption. It noted that China has shown a willingness to weaponise its dominance, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe added that this uncertainty has a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profit, according to Dawn.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

He is accused of hiding the fact that the Dwarapalaka (guardian deity) idols were gold-plated, and falsely recording them as copper sheets in the temple’s official documents.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Third arrest in the case</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKumar is the third person arrested in the case, after Potty, who sponsored the electroplating of the Dwarapalaka idol plates in 2019, and former administrative officer B Murari Babu. Officials said he will be presented before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court. The SIT has also questioned Vasudevan, a close aide of Potty, who allegedly kept an additional gold-plated pedestal from the idol, later found at a relative’s house in Thiruvananthapuram.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How did the gold go missing?</strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the report, investigators said Kumar had been associated with Sabarimala since the 1990s and knew the idols were covered in gold. In 2019, when the Dwarapalaka plates were handed over to the main accused, Unnikrishnan Potty, for gold plating, Kumar allegedly listed them as copper. This allowed Potty to remove the existing gold plating without raising suspicion.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Gold recovered from Karnataka</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn October, the SIT recovered about 400 grams of stolen gold from a jewellery shop in Bellari, Karnataka. The gold had been handed over by Potty to his associate Govardhan, whose shop was raided by the police. Investigators also found gold coins and ₹2 lakh in cash at Potty’s home in Pulimath, Thiruvananthapuram.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sabarimala temple gold theft</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 2019, copper plates clad in gold that adorned the Dwarapalaka idols and other sacred panels at the temple were removed for re-plating. The initial weight of the gold-clad plates was approximately 42.8 kg. However, when they were handed over to a firm in Chennai, their weight dropped to about 38.26 kg, leaving an unexplained shortfall of around 4.54 kg.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(With inputs from PTI)</em></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
