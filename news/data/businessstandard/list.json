Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said, “I like him a lot. But you know what they did was wrong. He (Carney) was very nice. He apologised for what they did with the commercial.”<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/world-news/xi-jinping-warns-leaders-against-us-led-efforts-to-cut-china-supply-chain-125110100132_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">'Prevent world from returning to law of jungle': Xi warns against bullying</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReiterating that the ad was false, Trump said, “It was the exact opposite.

He did apologise, and I appreciated it.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump also added that he maintains a \"very good relationship\" with the Canadian prime minister.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFord defends the ad</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who commissioned the advertisement, defended it despite the backlash. According to <em>The Globe and Mail, </em>Ford said Carney had previewed the ad before it was aired. He explained that the ad, shown during the World Series, aimed to promote fair trade and highlight the risks of tariffs, not to provoke the US.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe ad ran over the weekend before being pulled on Monday. Ford claimed it was viewed over a billion times, calling it “the most successful ad in North American history.\"</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat the ad featured?</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe one-minute video used clips from a 1987 speech by Republican and former US President Ronald Reagan, where he warned that tariffs “hurt every American” and could trigger “fierce trade wars.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the quotes were genuine, they were taken out of sequence. According to the <em>BBC</em>, in his original speech, Reagan had also mentioned imposing limited tariffs on some Japanese imports but reaffirmed his support for free trade overall.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Ronald Reagan Foundation later said the ad misrepresented Reagan’s message, adding to tensions already running high between the US and Canada over tariff policies.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tTrump cancels trade negotiations</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAngered by the ad, President Trump had announced the suspension of all trade negotiations with Canada. “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Based on their egregious behaviour, all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated,” he added. Trump also confirmed a 10 per cent tariff increase on goods imported from Canada following the controversy.</div></div>",

China's dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives, Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the paper, Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for the US industry, particularly in emerging markets. The forum, he said, focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US stakeholders are concerned about China's growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted that Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy- and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US underinvestment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Atlantic Council warned that these supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption. It noted that China has shown a willingness to weaponise its dominance, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe added that this uncertainty has a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profit, according to Dawn.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

According to the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) crossed 450 in several areas after Diwali celebrations, driven by a mix of firecracker smoke and stubble burning in neighbouring states.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/india-news/delhi-ncr-air-quality-improves-slightly-remains-poor-125103100195_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Air quality in Delhi-NCR improves slightly but remains in 'poor' category</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tHowever, the air quality in the national capital improved on Saturday, with the AQI dropping to 233 (poor category) from 288 on Friday.
