India consumes around 10–11 million tonnes of DAP annually, making it the second-largest fertiliser consumed in the country after urea.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDAP is a key crop nutrient consumed during the rabi sowing season, which begins in a few weeks, and is widely used in the production of wheat and potatoes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn FY25, India imported close to 5 million tonnes of DAP, while the balance was produced domestically.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA few months ago, Saudi Arabia’s Maaden, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of DAP, signed a long-term agreement with three Indian fertiliser companies — Indian Potash Limited (IPL), KRIBHCO, and Chambal Fertilisers (CIL) — for the supply of 3.1 million metric tonnes of DAP annually for five years starting FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe agreement also includes a provision for a five-year extension based on mutual consent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Most domestic DAP made from imported raw materials</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost of the DAP manufactured locally in India is produced from rock phosphate, while some units manufacture DAP using imported phosphoric acid.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry sources said that a majority of the raw materials used for making DAP locally, such as rock phosphate, are imported because domestic grades are unsuitable for producing high-grade DAP. However, some units have facilities to produce phosphoric acid from rock phosphate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Import costs push losses despite higher subsidy</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrade sources said that assuming the current imported price of DAP is around $780 per tonne, it would translate into a value of around Rs 69,240.6 per tonne.

October last year had seen strong festive momentum driven by Navratri (3–11 Oct) and Diwali (1 Nov 2024).

Property registrations observed a 4 per cent Y-o-Y growth during this period, while revenue grew by 11 per cent Y-o-Y.

While October saw a moderation from last year’s festive-driven high base, the city still recorded over 11,000 registrations, underscoring resilient underlying demand. The shift in the festive calendar advanced much of the celebratory buying to September, yet activity in October remained strong. The moderation in year-on-year growth is largely a function of the festive timing rather than any real market correction, highlighting the consistency and maturity of demand across segments.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Mid-income homes dominate, luxury share steady</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHomes priced below Rs 1 crore dominated, with their share rising from 45 per cent in October 2024 to 48 per cent this year. The Rs 1–2 crore category held firm at 31 per cent, indicating a stable core of mid-income demand, while the Rs 2–5 crore segment eased slightly to 16 per cent.

Does it matter', S Naren (ICICI AMC), Rajeev Thakkar (PPFAS AMC), Sailesh Raj Bhan (Nippon AMC), Mahesh Patil (Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC), and Rajeev Radhakrishnan (SBI AMC), discussed market volatility, India’s underperformance, and the outlook for equities and debt.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tGrowth temporarily slowed</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPatil attributed India’s underperformance to slower earnings and tighter policies. “India’s relative valuations versus other emerging markets had peaked,” he said. “Corporate earnings growth slowed to single digits, and restrictive fiscal and monetary policies added pressure.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the industry leaders agreed that the country is back on the growth track. Patil said: “With recent stimulus in the Budget and consumption recovery, we expect improvement ahead. Consumption, which was lagging, should get a boost due to goods and services tax (GST) cuts. Banking sector liquidity has also eased. Hence, corporate earnings growth should pick up.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Thakkar cautioned against expecting “hyper-normal” returns. “The last 12–15 months have gone by without major stock price movement,” he said. “Earnings have improved, but valuations in certain segments remain exuberant. Don’t expect explosive returns; equities should still outperform bonds over five years, but expectations must be realistic.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFavourable outlook for debt markets</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRadhakrishnan said the macro backdrop is positive for debt investors. “For the first time in years, we are not worried about inflation,” he said. “The RBI has created a favourable environment with policy easing and liquidity support. Fixed income markets now have the potential for stable, moderate returns.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that there is \"some more elbow room\" for the RBI to ease interest rates. \"Once that happens, there will possibly be a long pause,” Radhakrishnan said.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFintechs expanding reach</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tBhan said fintech platforms have broadened access to mutual funds. “Fintechs are doing a lot of the heavy lifting by reducing ticket sizes and bringing in new investors,” he said. “As the ecosystem matures, we’ll see more customers return to traditional fund houses.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the initial public offering (IPO) rush, he added: “In a bull market, supply is natural. It’s our job to ensure we buy the right business at the right price. When valuations look stretched, we prefer to stay cautious.”</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tInvestors carry the risk</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tNaren said that investors now shoulder most capital allocation risks. “In 2005-07, banks were the primary capital allocators and bore the brunt when things went wrong. Now, the burden has shifted to investors through direct equities, mutual funds, PMS, and alternative investment funds,” he said. “What many people haven’t realised in this cycle is that it’s the investors who are taking on all the risk. Over different cycles, the responsibility for risk has shifted, and this time, it squarely rests on investors.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThakkar said investors should use the Liberalised Remittance Scheme and GIFT City platforms for global diversification, noting that “overseas is available but it’s just that mutual funds don’t have much interest yet\". He cautioned against chasing gold and silver after their sharp rally driven by central bank buying, saying such assets lack cash flow and are “inherently unpredictable\".</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

I make close to a crore annually and have an eight-month-old daughter, so I had very strong motivations to come back to India,” he wrote.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that he had prepared a detailed itinerary and confirmed bookings for the Atlanta conference and hotel accommodation. “The conference wasn’t available for live streaming, so I had planned everything to attend it in person,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe later asked others on the platform, “What do you think triggered the quick rejection? Could I have answered differently while still being honest? What steps would you recommend before reapplying?”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why Section 214(b) matters</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSection 214(b) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act is the most common reason for tourist visa refusal. It applies when an applicant fails to convince the consular officer that they will return to their home country after visiting the United States.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the US Department of State, a visa is a privilege, not a guaranteed right, and can be denied or revoked if the officer doubts an applicant’s intent or credibility. Even small inconsistencies or perceived weaknesses in ties to the home country can lead to refusal under this provision.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
