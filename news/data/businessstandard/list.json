The country also witnessed a staggering 42 per cent jump in reported cybercrimes over the same period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025, during a panel discussion titled “Trust No One, Verify Everything: Cybersecurity for the Digital Age,” experts agreed on the urgent need for a zero-trust approach — a model now seen as essential for securing digital ecosystems as regulators demand greater operational transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA zero-trust model treats every user and device as untrusted, requiring continuous verification before granting access to systems or data.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tZero trust has been around for a while: Malcolm Gomes</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Malcolm Gomes, Chief Operating Officer, IDfy, the concept of zero trust has existed for some time. “It started with the NIST in the US, and the thought process came from there. At this point, regulators have not mandated it, but it has crept into the thought process of organisations,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMahavir Jindal, Chief Operations Officer, Amazon Pay India, agreed that zero trust is not a new concept. “If someone is in a financial services business, they have to operate in a zero-trust environment,” he said, adding that for him, zero trust is “all-pervasive.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCybersecurity shifting from perimeter defence to verification models</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Deep Narayan Mukherjee, Partner, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), cybersecurity used to be “perimeter dependent,” meaning that external requests to internal servers required verification. Under zero-trust architecture, however, it no longer matters whether a user is inside or outside the organisation — all must go through the same level of authentication and verification.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tZero trust a critical requirement: Deep Mukherjee</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMukherjee explained that in most cyberattacks, the breach begins with phishing, after which malware infiltrates and spreads through the system. “With a zero-trust architecture, if there is an exfiltration attempt, the activity would be detected and blocked immediately,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tThreat vectors evolving at a rapid scale: Mahavir Jindal</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJindal noted that threat vectors are evolving rapidly and that zero-trust capabilities must advance in tandem. He explained that at Amazon Pay, “any data exchange, whether with an external partner or an internal one, happens in a zero-trust environment — implying an exchange of keys.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he believes the industry is doing a decent job implementing zero-trust systems, Jindal warned that the pace of cyber threats continues to accelerate. “While we have a good foundation, there is a long way to go to address the emerging threat vectors,” he said.</div></div>",
