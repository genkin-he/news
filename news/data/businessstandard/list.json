The rest remains uncovered, which has a direct 2 per cent impact on India’s gross domestic product (GDP),” he said. Singhel emphasised the need for a joint strategy between the government and insurers involving “catastrophe bonds and tiered-level risk pooling” to make India’s disaster resilience more robust.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, Yashish Dahiya, chairman and group CEO, PB Fintech, mentioned that climate risk management cannot be left to insurers alone. “We need alignment of interests between government, industry, and consumers. Mandating basic catastrophe insurance for homeowners, just like motor insurance, can be a simple yet effective step,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDahiya suggested linking such insurance to essential utilities like electricity or gas connections to ensure universal coverage.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnup Rau, MD&amp;CEO, Generali Central Insurance Company, added that underwriting and claims management must evolve from reactive to preventive frameworks. “We must incentivise customers who take steps to secure their assets or reduce their carbon footprint. This shared responsibility will bring down risk costs over time,” he said, citing a partnership with the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) to promote such behaviour.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNaveen Chandra Jha, MD&amp;CEO, SBI General Insurance, pointed out that climate change is no longer a future concern but a current crisis. “Cyclones that used to occur once in five years are now happening four times a year,” he said, calling for dynamic underwriting practices using satellite imaging, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics. He also highlighted the success of a parametric insurance model piloted with the Nagaland Disaster Management Authority, where payouts are triggered automatically based on climatic parameters like temperature or rainfall.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTurning to cyber insurance, panellists agreed that India faces a mounting challenge as digital transactions soar. Rao warned that while large institutions are often insured, individual consumers remain highly exposed. “People fall prey to phishing or account breaches, but there is no appreciation of the need for cyber cover,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJha said that cyber frauds account for about 0.7 per cent of India’s GDP, with actual losses likely closer to 2 per cent due to underreporting. “With 600 million Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions happening daily, cyber risk has grown exponentially. Insurers are responding with new products that even cover risks like password sharing or social engineering fraud,” he said. Jha added that collaboration with tech firms is crucial as “cybercriminals are always two steps ahead”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the evolving motor insurance landscape, Singhel said EVs bring new challenges, especially related to battery safety and infrastructure. “We are looking at global EV insurance models and customising them for India. Our focus is not only on accident coverage but also on roadside assistance, charging infrastructure, and battery-related risks,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry experts said insurers are keeping pace with the fast-changing EV ecosystem. “EV insurance in India today is quite robust,” one executive said, noting that the segment is evolving in complexity just like automobiles themselves. “The real test will come when self-driving cars arrive — that’s when liability determination will become an entirely new challenge for insurers and courts,” the executive said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDahiya said: “About 5.5 per cent of our motor insurance searches now relate to EVs — a 65 per cent jump over last year. Battery protection products are seeing a 67 per cent attachment rate, showing that consumers are aware and concerned about battery risk.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that third-party losses may actually be lower for EVs because of safer driving behaviour among early adopters.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRau explained that while claim-handling for EVs is not fundamentally different from other vehicles, the future challenge will lie in assigning liability once autonomous driving becomes common. “Ultimately, liability will stay — whether with the manufacturer or the user — and insurers will adapt as patterns emerge,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTalking about goods and services tax (GST) waiver on health insurance, Jha said it has already improved affordability and awareness — two of the three pillars of insurance adoption. “With GST waived, affordability has gone up, and the media coverage around it has created more awareness. Now it’s our turn as insurers to focus on accessibility — reaching Tier-2, Tier-3 cities, and rural India,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRau added that while insurers lose some input tax credit (ITC) benefits, customers are saving nearly 16-18 per cent, which will likely improve retention. “Many customers are realising their renewal premiums are lower than last year’s. That’s a big psychological boost and should reduce policy lapses,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSinghel said that while the GST move is welcome, India must go further to ensure universal health coverage. “Health is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. We still have 40 crore-50 crore Indians uninsured, which costs the economy 1.2 per cent in lost growth each year. If everyone were covered, India’s GDP could be 1.2 per cent higher,” he said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThree of India’s biggest financial regulators set the tone for discussions on the second day of the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025. The day kicked off with a fireside chat with Ajay Seth, chairman of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), who assured stakeholders that as a regulator he has an open mind.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t“As a regulator, this being my first appearance, I would like to assure that I have an open mind. Based on data, analysis, and the perspectives I hear, I reach a conclusion. But nothing is done without extensive consultation, generating discussion, and building consensus,” said Seth. His comments would be reassuring for an industry battling muted growth in new policies and premium income.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t“The insurance sector, and especially the health insurance sector, is at an unstable equilibrium at the moment. On the life side, there is a low-efficiency equilibrium happening. But other sectors that manage the savings pools of Indians are giving tough competition to life insurance companies,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn the question of more capital for the insurance industry, he said that allowing 100 per cent FDI alone cannot meet the sector’s capital needs. “The own capital of the  insurance industry is about ₹3.5 trillion, both life and non-life put together. Out of this, FDI is only ₹80,000-90,000 crore.”</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe government’s plan to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) of up to 100 per cent in the insurance sector could also pave the way for global pension fund managers to enter the market without joint venture partners, as the FDI norms under insurance and pension laws are “joined at the hip”, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Chairperson S Ramann indicated in a fireside chat. Currently, FDI is permitted up to 74 per cent in the pension fund management space.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tStressing the need to enhance pension coverage in the country, Ramann also said the regulator is considering allowing smaller pension fund houses, on the lines of small finance banks regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. Such funds, with lower capital requirements, could offer products for underserved sections of the population in tier-III cities, MSME clusters, and rural communities that may not have any social security cover.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn all, there were 15 sessions on the second day of the summit, with top executives from life insurance, general insurance, private equity, the payments industry, wealth management, and the microfinance industry presenting the way forward for their sectors.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tReserve Bank of India Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said that internationalisation of the Indian rupee is not intended to replace the dollar but to reduce risk for Indian businesses by enabling more transactions in rupees. “If you look at the Reserve Bank’s stance on capital account convertibility, we have fairly consistently been saying that it is a process, not an event. In this spirit, we have gradually been liberalising the capital account. Today, barring a few constraints like cost caps and amount limits on ECBs (external commercial borrowings), most inward capital flows are liberalised,” he said.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/companies/quarterly-results/itc-q2-results-net-profit-rises-2-7-to-5-126-11-cr-revenue-down-1-3-125103001412_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">ITC Q2 results: Net profit rises 2.7% to ₹5,126.11 cr, revenue down 1.3%</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAccording to Sankar, the regulator is currently focused on liberalising inward capital flows given the country’s need for capital at its current stage of development, but as the Indian economy matures, it will look at outward capital flows.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t“Trade is largely free, with only procedural requirements such as repatriation timelines. We have already released two draft proposals to simplify trade regulations, reducing over 100 directives to a single comprehensive framework. ECB liberalisation is part of this broader effort. Our priority remains on facilitating inflows of capital first, followed by calibrated outflows,” he said.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe RBI deputy governor also deliberated on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and politely brushed off suggestions that it had failed to take off. “We are not rushing it because most countries are still experimenting and studying its impact. Over 10 crore transactions have taken place, but we are going slow to understand potential effects -- for instance, whether CBDCs could replace bank deposits. We are technologically ready, but our approach is cautious,” he remarked.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tTop executives in the wealth management industry said that India’s growing economy is a major tailwind for them. The industry is entering a defining phase as a swelling pool of high-net-worth (HNI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNI) fuels demand for sophisticated financial advice and innovative investment products.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIndia’s millionaire households have nearly doubled since 2021, with smaller towns and cities contributing significantly to the growth. This surge, driven by economic expansion and a shift towards financialisation, is transforming the wealth management landscape, making services more accessible and technology-driven, most panellists echoed.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tExecutives from the microfinance industry (MFI) said the worst is behind them after recent quarters marked by liquidity stress, rising delinquencies, and slowing disbursements. “Now the situation is better. We have requested the government to institute a larger guarantee fund of, say, ₹ 20,000 crore, which will kick-start the virtuous cycle of funding and give confidence to banks,” said Alok Misra, CEO of the Microfinance Industry Network (MFIN).<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAnother high point of the penultimate day was a fireside chat with Arundhati Bhattacharya, former banker and now chairperson and CEO of Salesforce India, and one of the country’s top women business leaders. “If you’re a woman in India with a career, you have to continuously calibrate how to take care of family responsibilities while taking on newer responsibilities at work. There will be times when you feel it’s not worth it, but you need to accept that this is how it will be and find a way to still get ahead,” she said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tExecutives from the payments industry assured that Indian financial sector customers are relatively safer thanks to the Reserve Bank of India’s stringent requirements from the industry, even as they await implementation of the data privacy Bill.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tDeep Narayan Mukherjee, partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), said: “Data breach is one aspect of a cyberattack; the other is ransomware, which is not related to your customer. There are more and more instances globally in the last two or three months where non-customer-centric organisations’ businesses have been hacked.” He was speaking at a session on 'Trust No One, Verify Everything: Cybersecurity for the Digital Age'.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAt the general insurance panel discussion, the chiefs of general insurance companies highlighted that, with a surge in climate-related disasters, cyber threats, and emerging workplace models, there needs to be stronger collaboration between insurers, government, and technology partners to address these “new-age risks”. They also said there is a need to build comprehensive frameworks to protect people and businesses against digital fraud, climate catastrophes, and the risks associated with electric vehicles and the gig economy.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAt the life insurance panel discussion, the chiefs of life insurers said that the recent GST reforms will make insurance more affordable and inclusive in India. The GST exemption in insurance will help reduce premiums, enhance affordability, and signal the government’s strong focus on insurance as an essential life necessity.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tCrypto industry leaders and policymakers urged the government to introduce clear regulations for digital assets, warning that prolonged uncertainty is driving innovation and talent overseas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn a panel titled India’s Crypto Crossroads: Time for a Policy Rethink?, Dilip Chenoy (Bharat Web3 Association), Sumit Gupta (CoinDCX), G Padmanabhan (former executive director, RBI), and S B Sekar (head of APAC, Binance) said India risks missing a $1.1 trillion opportunity by delaying policy action. They also called for an INR-backed stablecoin to reduce remittance costs and strengthen India’s monetary sovereignty.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tPadmanabhan cautioned that with 97 per cent of stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, India must act to avoid dollar dominance. Gupta added that “the best time to regulate was yesterday; the next best is today.” While panellists were divided on creating a separate regulator, they agreed that India must move fast on principle-based, flexible rules that balance innovation and oversight. Without clarity, they warned, India’s Web3 and blockchain talent will continue to leave for friendlier markets, eroding its leadership in digital finance.</div></div>",

Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>How do we scale up India’s pension coverage?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe National Pension System (NPS) has delivered an average annual return of 9.2 per cent over 15 years, but participation remains skewed. About 75 per cent of total NPS assets are from government subscribers and 25 per cent from others. We perhaps need to reverse that. The goal should be to raise non-government NPS members from 10 million to 250–300 million in the next five to six years using various digital platforms. We need more funds as well, particularly to reach out to Tier-II and Tier-III cities.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have large co-operatives, areas where there is greater wealth, micro, small, and medium enterprise clusters, and lots of workers. We never know where that demand comes from, and we need not just stick to the existing structure of a pension fund that requires ₹50 crore of capital. Can we not look at having a small pension fund, if I could take a leaf out of small finance banks?<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe need to leverage the fact that we’ve got the best payment system in the world. So why are we not able to bring in more people as distributors who are probably not regulated entities as we demand today? We just need to ensure we are testing for the data flow and ensuring there are no leaks anywhere.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Even before the Association of Mutual Funds in India launched the popular ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ campaign, PFRDA had launched the ‘NPS Zaroori Hai’ campaign. Is there something in the works to spread the pension message further?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis issue cuts across financial products. Financial literacy is the bedrock for a lot of buying of financial products, and we still need to get that literacy going in vast numbers in a lot of regions. We are so urban-focused today that we’ve forgotten what it is to be able to do a small business in a reasonably small town. I can assure you there is such a high aspiration among those people to grow their wealth and get their children better educated. We need to have financial planners cutting across the sort of turf between mutual funds (MFs), insurance, and pensions, and have the large number of persons who are already there as a distribution workforce ensure we have a minimum certification programme for each product and make that into a viable business. We really have to look at literacy going down to the grassroots. The regulators should be putting their effort behind this entire literacy campaign to reach the right audience with the right content.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The multiplicity of pension products under different regulatory domains is an issue. The insurance industry offers ‘retirement’ products, including annuities. A few MF schemes are called retirement benefit plans. There is, of course, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Is there a need for some cohesion in the way these products are regulated, maybe through a dialogue with other regulators?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThat dialogue is actually happening. There is a regulatory forum for pensions, which has already been instituted. But I think the larger issue is that we have had financial products emerge over the past 150 years, and each one has come in for a particular purpose and has served that purpose very well. I would say that given the need for all these products, we need to have a simple definition which everybody adheres to. So, in order to reduce the possibility of mis-selling, what does a pension product mean? According to us, it is at least 15 years of being invested in a particular product and saving towards that.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have something called a reasonable corpus that builds up with the power of compounding, but at the end of that, today, the law says that you have to forcibly put it into an annuity. Now, an annuity is a very good product, but given the fact that it has to deal with the uncertainty of life, anyone who has designed that product will ensure that there is enough capital buffer and a solvency ratio to ensure that you are in a position to meet the longevity risk as and when it happens. So we have to provide alternatives in terms of the pension payout product. That is why PFRDA has issued a consultation paper looking at the possibility of whether we can add something further with annuity. I think the job really is for the regulator to put across a set of products, and finally, it is for each customer to choose what is suitable for them.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The late finance minister Arun Jaitley had alluded to an idea in one of his Budget speeches that an Indian employee should have a choice between the EPFO and the NPS. Could this new forum examine this?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe EPF is a provident fund which has an accumulation stage. A pension has both an accumulation and a payout stage. The EPF is there for good reason, because there was nothing else in this country. The pension sliver started in 1995. Unfortunately, it was targeted to everybody and not just those below the threshold of income for EPF coverage. So, going forward, as part of the regulators’ forum, we are talking about how these pension products could come under a single regulatory umbrella.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEPF and Public Provident Fund are in a particular genre and we should let them remain. It is for the customers, given their tax profile, to assess which products they should put their money in. The return on the EPF corpus may be a tad below what the NPS has got, but it’s also a very good rate of return. So we should have competing products. And that level of competition really is what we should be looking forward to.</div></div>",

At the heart of it stood Jemimah Rodrigues, who played the innings of her life — a breathtaking, unbeaten 127 off 134 balls that turned dreams into destiny on Thursday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen the pressure was at its peak and the shadows of Australia’s dominance loomed large, Rodrigues’ composure and poise stood out.

It was a daunting total, built on dominance — but India had other plans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Rodrigues rises as India’s new hero</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia’s pursuit of the record target began cautiously. Shafali Verma opened with intent, cracking Kim Garth through the covers for a crisp boundary in the second over, but her stay was short-lived as she was trapped leg before off the very next ball.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSmriti Mandhana, the leading run-scorer of the tournament before the semifinals, too fell early — edging a leg-side delivery to the wicketkeeper for 24. That left India wobbling at 59 for two, with Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur tasked with rebuilding the innings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe pair steadied the ship with composure and precision. Rodrigues was the more enterprising of the two, reaching her half-century in 57 balls with a boundary off Alana King in the 21st over. Kaur, who had scored 70 against England earlier in the tournament, adopted a more measured approach, bringing up her 22nd ODI fifty off 65 deliveries as India reached 189 for two after 30 overs — still 150 short of the target.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe tension lifted when wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy dropped Rodrigues off King, a miss that proved costly. On the very next delivery, Kaur cut King past point to raise the 150-run stand, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAustralia fought back briefly, with King and Sutherland tightening the screws. Kaur’s dismissal — a lofted shot brilliantly caught by Ashleigh Gardner off Sutherland — broke the partnership at 226 in the 36th over.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDeepti Sharma’s brisk 24 kept the momentum alive before she was run out with nine overs remaining. Rodrigues, meanwhile, powered ahead, completing her third ODI century off 115 balls — a masterclass laced with ten fours. She enjoyed a slice of fortune on 106 when Tahlia McGrath dropped a straightforward catch, but by then, India had seized full control.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRicha Ghosh’s cameo of 26 from 16 deliveries further eased the chase, though her late dismissal added a brief flicker of tension. With 29 needed off the last four overs, Rodrigues remained unflappable, threading three more boundaries in quick succession. Amanjot Kaur, calm at the other end, struck the winning runs with nine balls to spare, sealing one of India’s most memorable victories in women’s cricket history.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The winning moment</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen Amanjot Kaur pierced the field with the winning shot, the floodgates of emotion burst open.

This surge — driven by economic expansion and a shift towards financialisation — is transforming the wealth management landscape, making services more accessible and technology-driven, echoed most panellists during a discussion with Samie Modak of <em>Business Standard</em>.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAnas Rahman Junaid, founder and chief researcher at Hurun India, said, “From a wealth creation standpoint, India is now on steroids.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by $1 trillion over the last four years and is expected to rise by another $2 trillion by 2030. This could double the country’s HNI and UHNI base.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tRajesh Saluja, managing director (MD), ASK Private Wealth, said India still has considerable headroom to grow.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“India now has about 1,600 dollar billionaires compared to 11,000 in the US. While the US has nearly 3.4 million dollar millionaires, India has fewer than 600,000. We have a massive runway ahead,” he said, adding that HNI and UHNI populations are growing at around 8–9 per cent annually.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRahul Jain, president and head of Nuvama Wealth, noted that over the past decade, India’s wealthy have gradually shifted from traditional assets, such as real estate and gold, to financial investments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Younger investors led the initial move into equities and mutual funds. In recent years, older generations have also turned to professional wealth management — often after monetising real estate assets — to diversify their portfolios,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Saluja, mature investors with experience across multiple market cycles are maintaining discipline amid volatility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“While equity remains the core holding, investors are seeking returns from fixed income, gold, and silver during periods of market consolidation,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAllocations are also diversifying into alternatives, such as private credit, real estate investment trusts (Reits), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), and pre-IPO private equities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJain said investor sentiment is split — one group remains bullish on equities post-consolidation, while another prefers stability through fixed income and gold after subdued equity returns.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTechnology is emerging as a key enabler in broadening access to sophisticated products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSrikanth Subramanian, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Ionic Wealth, said, “We aim to make investment opportunities — once limited to the ultra-rich — accessible to a wider audience. It would be through technology, regulation, and fractionalisation, including tokenised or blockchain-based structures.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, panellists added that human relationships remain at the heart of wealth management.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“HNIs and UHNIs still prefer personalised advice. Technology should enhance, not replace, that touch,” Saluja said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWealth managers and panellists agreed to play a vital role in guiding long-term discipline and strategy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The real value now lies in helping clients stay committed to asset allocation and compounding over time rather than chasing products,” said Jain.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs the industry becomes more competitive and transparent, firms are under pressure to justify their fees and performance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSubramanian noted that wealth managers are being driven towards outcome-based advice and full fee transparency.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSaluja added that professional standards must evolve. “Introducing certification requirements and accountability for relationship managers is essential to ensure client trust and industry credibility,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJunaid highlighted that India’s wealth creation is no longer confined to major cities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In 2015, only 25 non-metro towns featured ultra-rich individuals. That number has now grown to 113. The count of individuals with net worth above ₹1,000 crore outside metros has risen from 87 to 755. Their combined wealth is more than double from ₹7 trillion to ₹16 trillion,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that much of this new wealth is coming from sectors such as industrial products, construction, engineering, and local real estate. This reflects the rise in regional entrepreneurship and manufacturing, he said.</div></div>",
