But details of its product line-up plans and dealership strategies have not previously been reported.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe 15 models will include Toyota's own cars, vehicles supplied by Suzuki, as well as upgrades of existing models, according to three people briefed on the matter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are likely to be at least two new SUVs from Toyota's own brand, which will be designed to take on leading SUV-makers like Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Hyundai Motor, as well as an affordable pickup truck to widen its appeal in rural India, one of the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tToyota is also setting up lean-format sales outlets, with just one or two cars on display instead of the whole range, and smaller, two-bay workshops in rural areas to make deeper inroads there, the source added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Toyota has a two-pronged strategy for India - lure customers from competitors with mid-market and premium SUVs and continue adding buyers in small towns and rural markets,\" a second source said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe sources, who declined to be named as the information is private, said the strategy is still being finalised.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tToyota said in a statement that it had not announced this information and it does not comment on speculation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Record India profits driving growth</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Japanese carmaker's local unit, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, logged a record profit of $640 million last fiscal year, thanks to its alliance with Suzuki which boosted sales and increased factory utilisation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Toyota is by far the larger automaker, Suzuki's local unit, Maruti Suzuki, is the top car company in India, where it dominates with fuel-efficient and affordable small, compact cars.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIndia has become Toyota's third-largest market outside Japan - trailing the United States and China. Toyota sold over 300,000 vehicles in India last year, of which about 60 per cent were Suzuki models, and has a growing share of exports to countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tToyota's capacity expansion will happen in phases, but once complete, it will be able to produce over 1 million cars a year in India between its two manufacturing sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe carmaker's hybrids like the Urban Cruiser Hyryder SUV and Innova Hycross MPV have helped it carve out a lead in alternate-fuel vehicles - something it plans to build on with new product launches, the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAt its new plant in western Aurangabad city, Toyota's first product is expected to be an SUV which will come with multiple powertrains including gasoline, hybrid and electric and which will be sold in India and exported, the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to Toyota's $3 billion investment, Suzuki announced in August that it would invest $8 billion in India over the next five to six years. Hyundai Motor said this month, it will invest $5 billion to expand its Indian manufacturing and research operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(Reporting by Aditi Shah in Tokyo, Additional reporting by Daniel Leussink; Editing by David Dolan and Edwina Gibbs)</p><p></p></div>",

            "id": 125103100024,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tThe Senate passed a resolution Thursday that would undo many of President Donald Trump's tariffs around the globe, the latest note of displeasure at his trade tactics in Washington that came just as the president celebrated his negotiations with China as a success.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAfter a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would, in turn, purchase 25 million metric tons of US soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiations would secure prosperity and security to millions of Americans.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut back in Washington, senators several from Trump's Republican Party have demonstrated their dissent with Trump's tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump's tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is still much higher than we've had.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt still will lead to increased prices, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new rule that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won't ultimately take effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Democrats can force a vote but not a result</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tBut Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmerican families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up, said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that in many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest, and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that Americans shouldn't be fooled by Trump's announcement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDonald Trump has folded, leaving American families and farmers and small businesses to deal with the wreckage from his blunders, from his erratic on again off again tariff policies, said the New York Democrat.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Republicans see Trump's trade policy</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tOverall, there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump's import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThose four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil, but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI agree with my colleagues that tariffs should be more targeted to avoid harm to Americans, said Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a floor speech. Yet, he added that Trump's negotiations are bearing fruit and praised his announcement that Beijing would allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans again.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans representing farm states were especially enthused by the announcement that China would be purchasing 25 million metric tonnes of soybeans annually, starting with 10 million metric tons for the rest of this year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said the deal with China absolutely justifies Trump's use of tariff threats to negotiate trade policy with other nations. He called the announcement huge news for Kansas farmers, but also acknowledged that they would still probably need financial help as they deal with the strain of losing their biggest customer for soybeans and sorghum.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not like you can snap your finger and send over $15 billion worth of sorghum and soybeans together overnight, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina had been the largest purchaser of US soybeans until this year. It purchased almost 27 million metric tons in 2024, so Trump's negotiated deal only guarantees to return soybean exports to China to less than their previous level.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSen Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called the purchase agreement a start.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAsked whether he agreed with Trump's assessment that his meeting with Xi had been a runaway success, Cramer smiled and said the president is nothing if not optimistic.</p><p></p></div>",
