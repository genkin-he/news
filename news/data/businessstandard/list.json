The money will help him move out of Royal Lodge in Windsor, where he has lived for years, into a smaller private home on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the report, the relocation package is said to include a six-figure sum to cover moving costs, followed by a regular stipend several times larger than his £20,000-a-year navy pension. According to the report, the goal is to prevent the former prince from overspending and help him spend his life as a commoner.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talks between Andrew’s representatives and the King’s aides are still ongoing, the plan is expected to be finalised soon.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Andrew to vacate royal palace after Christmas</strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAndrew is expected to remain at the Royal Lodge until after Christmas before moving to Sandringham.

This means Andrew can no longer use the titles 'Prince' or 'His Royal Highness.' He has also been removed from the official roll of the peerage, and the King will issue royal documents to make the decision permanent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why was Andrew removed?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAndrew’s removal stemmed from his connection to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. According to media reports, Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s trafficking victims, accused Andrew of sexually assaulting her when she was 17. Although Andrew denied the allegations, his reputation suffered heavily.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe King’s decision followed renewed public attention after Giuffre’s memoir, published earlier this year, repeated her claims. Palace insiders said the move was “necessary” to protect the monarchy’s reputation, even though Andrew continues to deny any wrongdoing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a statement, the palace said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of all forms of abuse.” The British government also supported the King’s decision, calling it appropriate and sound.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

From early stumbles to a record-breaking semifinal win, the Women in Blue have showcased skill, spirit, and self-belief on their march to the summit clash against South Africa in Navi Mumbai.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Confident Start: Beating Sri Lanka in Guwahati (Sept 30)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia opened their campaign with a commanding win over Sri Lanka, setting the perfect tone for the tournament. After a brief mid-innings wobble, the middle order rose to the challenge, guiding India to a solid 271. The bowlers complemented the effort beautifully, wrapping up the Sri Lankan innings for 211 with eight balls to spare. It was a performance built on composure and teamwork, proof that India could recover, rebuild, and dominate.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Classic Rivalry, Same Result: Crushing Pakistan in Colombo (Oct 5)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgainst arch-rivals Pakistan, India were all business.

The victory not only maintained India’s perfect record against Pakistan but also strengthened their confidence and momentum heading into tougher battles.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Setback in Visakhapatnam: South Africa Edge India (Oct 9)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Women in Blue faced their first major test against South Africa and came agonisingly close. Richa Ghosh’s attacking 94 lit up the innings, taking India to 251. However, Nadine de Klerk’s gritty unbeaten 84 guided South Africa home by three wickets.

But Alyssa Healy’s sublime 142 turned the tide, as Australia clinched the thriller by three wickets. Despite the loss, India’s fearless batting display proved they could go toe-to-toe with the best.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Narrow Miss: England Hold Their Nerve in Indore (Oct 19)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother close contest followed against England.

Chasing 339 against a formidable Australian side, Rodrigues’ unbeaten 127* was the cornerstone of a record-breaking chase. Supported by Harmanpreet Kaur and Richa Ghosh, India stormed home with nine balls to spare.
