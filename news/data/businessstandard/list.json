This combination appears to have been preferred by Tipu Sultan, and they appeared among his other trappings of state when he presided over his public audiences, notes the catalogue entry.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBesides the pistols, a silver-mounted flintlock blunderbuss or bukmar firearm made for Tipu Sultan sold for 571,500 pounds.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe first lot in the sale, a rare late 16th century Quran manuscript from the library of Mughal Emperor Akbar in India, sparked a 15-minute bidding battle to go under the hammer selling for 863,600 pounds.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the other Indian highlights at the auction included a set of albums containing 52 paintings of Indian costumes, held in the same family since the original commission 225 years ago, which fetched 609,600 pounds.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA Mughal jade horsehead hilted dagger and scabbard also beat expectations to fetch 406,400 pounds and a 17th century painting of elephants frolicking in a mountain lake in India sold for 139,700 pounds.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Sotheby's, 20 per cent of the buyers in this week's sale were new to the auction house and included lively bidding from 25 countries across the world, including India.</p><p></p></div>",

During the first six months of the financial year – April-September – India's goods exports rose to $220.12 billion from $213.68 billion a year earlier. However, this was mainly because exports to the US were being frontloaded.
