Many sustained injuries or suffered breathlessness and were admitted to local hospitals. According to the survivors, chaos broke out when the only fate was abruptly opened, allowing those who had compeleted their darshan to come out, while another group waiting below tried to enter. This resulted in people falling on one another and a weak steel grill gave way, trapping many devotees underneath. The approach to the temple is narrow. There were many people and only single entry and exit point. As people jostled, we fell down. The steel grill was also very weak. The grill people were holding onto broke and everybody fell, an autorickhaw driver, who survived the accident, told media.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said around 20 devotees from his Dharmapuram village had travelled in two autorickshaws to the temple.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"A boy who was also standing under the grill died. He was about 12 years old... he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnother survivor, a woman undergoing treatment at the hospital, said the temple management first allowed some people for darshan and closed the gate ,and then suddenly reopened it. Opening the gate at once led to those coming out pushing against us, she said adding she fell down and three people fell on her. A second male survivor said so many devotees were pushing against the closed gate. Then the door opened suddenly from the other side. Those returning came down with force. Because of their pressure, the people standing by the door and on the staircase could not stand. They all fell over one another, he said. He said the tragedy could have been averted if separate routes had been arranged for entry and exit. \"There were provisions, but they did not use it.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tA woman who broke her legs in the incident, said she visited the temple for auspicious 'Ekadasi' day.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAs people fell on me, my leg got stuck in a rod and broke... My husband is a kidney patient undergoing dialysis and now this has happened, said the woman, breaking down. Another woman from Tekkali mandal, attending to her injured husband at the hospital, said devotees are also to blame for the tragedy. We saw the crowd and went ahead. But the temple authorities should have stopped us, she said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCriticising the poor arrangements at the temple, she said even basic facilities like drinking water were not available. This is very unfortunate. We go to see God to seek blessings. Had the police been deployed this might have been prevented, she added. Meanwhile, a doctor treating the injured said nearly 30 people were admitted. Most came with injuries and breathlessness. Many with broken limbs. We gave first aid to all of them, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

The government there is not going to last long,\" he claimed.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe allusion was to the BJP's dependence on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar-led JD(U), which, along with Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, provided the much-needed support to form the third Narendra Modi government after last year's Lok Sabha elections.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tYadav said it is up to the people of Bihar to not just \"improve the future of the state, but also the entire nation\".</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Just like UP's voters defeated the BJP in Awadh, the people of Bihar will defeat them in Magadh,\" he claimed, referring to the ruling party's setback in Uttar Pradesh in last year's Lok Sabha polls, which is believed to be the cause why it could not secure a majority on its own like the previous two elections.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Samajwadi Party clinched 37 of UP's 80 Lok Sabha seats, while the BJP bagged 33.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYadav said NDA leaders were celebrating the GST rate cuts, but they should tell the people who set high rates in the first place, leading to inflation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"They are talking about migration, but the BJP itself is responsible for migration from Bihar.

The rise was driven by sustained demand for both compact cars and SUVs, aided by GST reforms that reduced prices ahead of the festive season.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRetail sales, however, outpaced wholesales as vehicles continued to move swiftly out of showrooms. While final numbers are being collated, industry insiders estimate that retail sales reached around 600,000 units in October.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMaruti Suzuki India posted its highest-ever monthly dispatches in its 40-year history at 180,675 units, including light commercial vehicles.

He added that the company expects its Vahan market share to be around 43.5 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tModels like the Fronx recorded a 53.3 per cent jump in retail sales with 28,327 units sold. Other strong performers included the Ertiga (23,429 units), Dzire (28,000 units), Swift (24,348 units), WagonR (24,193 units) and Baleno (23,000 units). The Eeco, with 18,207 units, also had one of its best-ever months. Banerjee noted that Brezza sales were affected by some production constraints, with retail at 17,847 units in October.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMaruti’s overall PV dispatches rose 10.48 per cent year-on-year to 176,318 units in October.

Bookings for cars in the 18 per cent GST slab — vehicles under four metres with engines up to 1,200 cc (petrol) or 1,500 cc (diesel) — increased by about 50 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTata Motors reported a 27 per cent rise in dispatches to 61,134 units in October, led by SUVs, which accounted for a record 77 per cent of monthly sales.

The Nexon posted a 50 per cent growth in volumes, while Harrier and Safari combined sold about 7,000 units.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Vahan data, Tata Motors retailed 74,705 units in October, up from 41,151 units in September, surpassing Hyundai Motor India and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M), which retailed 65,045 and 66,800 units, respectively. Between Navratri and Diwali, Tata Motors delivered 100,000 vehicles, a 33 per cent increase year-on-year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHyundai Motor India reported dispatches of 53,792 units, down 3 per cent, while exports stood at 16,102 units. “October 2025 was a month driven by the festivals of Dussehra, Dhanteras and Diwali, further complemented by the positive impact of GST 2.0 reforms,” said Tarun Garg, Whole-time Director and COO, Hyundai Motor India. He added that the company achieved its second-highest ever combined monthly sales for the Creta and Venue, with 30,119 units sold.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tM&amp;M said it achieved its highest-ever monthly SUV sales in October at 71,264 units, a 31 per cent year-on-year increase. “October was a record month for us, driven by strong SUV demand,” said Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, Automotive Division, M&amp;M.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJapanese automaker Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) reported a 43 per cent year-on-year jump in sales to 40,257 units in October. “The recently introduced festive editions of the Urban Cruiser Hyryder Aero Edition and the 2025 Fortuner Leader Edition have received tremendous appreciation for their unique styling and premium value proposition,” said Varinder Wadhwa, Vice President (Sales, Service &amp; Used Car Business) at TKM.
