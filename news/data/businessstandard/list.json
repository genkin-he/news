The adjusted Ebitda margin improved to 2.8 per cent of GOV (up 125 basis points Y-o-Y and 44 basis points Q-o-Q), demonstrating that efforts to increase users’ interactions with the platform through new use cases and optimal affordability are gaining traction — without sacrificing growth or profitability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInstamart, the company’s quick-commerce platform, reported GOV growth of 108 per cent Y-o-Y (and 24.2 per cent Q-o-Q) to Rs 7,022 crore.

The average order value (AOV) increased 39.7 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 697, driven by continued traction from Maxxsaver, its basket-building proposition, and expansion into non-grocery categories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company said that, in an industry first, Instamart successfully completed the inaugural Quick Commerce sale called the “Quick India Movement”, showcasing over 30,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) to the majority of consumers. The contribution margin improved to -2.6 per cent (+202 basis points Q-o-Q) on the back of expanded basket sizes, optimisation of customer incentives, and operating leverage.

This was led by acceleration in user growth on the back of new propositions such as Bolt, 99 Store, Deskeats, and health-focused curations — all aimed at covering the entire breadth of user expectations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Instamart made giant strides in catering to all purchase missions through Maxxsaver (grocery) and Quick India Movement (non-grocery), driving up AOV 40 per cent Y-o-Y,” said Majety. “A 200-basis-point Q-o-Q contribution margin improvement showcases our commitment to driving scale-led, sustainable, and profitable growth in quick commerce, led by best-in-class speed and selection.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the company’s board of directors is scheduled to meet on November 7, 2025, to consider and approve the raising of funds up to Rs 10,000 crore through public or private offerings.
