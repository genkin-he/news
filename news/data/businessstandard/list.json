But with other states increasingly saying they would rather hire their own, out-migration from Bihar might slow down despite the government's failures in creating an employment-friendly ecosystem. The fantastical promises about job creation from all parties, however, proves one thing: the incumbent government has failed to do so in the past. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUS President Donald Trump earlier this week dropped a shockingly dangerous post, saying his country would resume nuclear testing.

The larger message, though, was that for all his leveraging America's buying power (read consumerism), China is the one with a hand on both sides of the trade scale - as buyer and seller. And this is where India has fallen woefully short with its miniscule trade numbers, thanks to a protectionist mindset, barely qualifying as a strategic weapon. Indeed, protectionism itself has become a strategic liability. This, he writes, could be India's second 1991 moment: reform by compulsion. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd finally, <strong>Kumar Abishek</strong> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/night-stolen-by-light-how-our-love-of-brightness-became-overexposure-125103101581_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">looks up, or rather, mourns that we no longer can</a>.

Meanwhile, he's embraced Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaida fighter once held in an American prison in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut serious challenges remain, particularly in the Middle East. Gabbard noted in her brief remarks that the ceasefire in Gaza remained fragile. She also acknowledged Iran remained a concern as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said renewed movement has been detected recently at the country's nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe road ahead will not be simple or easy but the president is very committed down this road, said Gabbard, who attended the event as a government shutdown grinds on back home.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAn Associated Press journalist had been accredited and issued a visa to cover the summit, but the Bahraini government late Wednesday said it had been rescinded as it was conducting a post-approval review of that permission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe government did not elaborate on why the visa was revoked. Earlier that day, the AP published a story on long-detained activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja beginning an open-ended hunger strike in Bahrain over his internationally criticised imprisonment.</p><p></p></div>",
