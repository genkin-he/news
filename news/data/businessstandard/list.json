He explained that at Amazon Pay, “any data exchange, whether with an external partner or an internal one, happens in a zero-trust environment — implying an exchange of keys.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he believes the industry is doing a decent job implementing zero-trust systems, Jindal warned that the pace of cyber threats continues to accelerate. “While we have a good foundation, there is a long way to go to address the emerging threat vectors,” he said.</div></div>",

The development led to a drop of more than 4 per cent in the company’s share price.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Considering this is a major near-term product opportunity for the company, we expect near-term volatility in the share price,” an analysis by Nuvama stated.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to analysts, the development could delay the launch of DRL’s new semaglutide injection by at least eight to twelve months.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Though we were always cautious on this opportunity, a negative review by Health Canada reflects the worst case,” a report by market analyst Citigroup stated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Patent expiry and market opportunity for generics</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSemaglutide is the active ingredient in the popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, manufactured by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeveral drugmakers have been targeting the production of a generic version of semaglutide, as Novo’s patent on it is set to expire in several markets starting next year. Among them, the Canadian market is expected to be the first to see semaglutide lose exclusivity, with patent expiry due in January 2026.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts said Canada appears cautious about approving generic versions of semaglutide since it is a mass-market product without any approved generic from a developed-market regulator, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Due to this, we think Health Canada is cautious before it approves the first semaglutide generic. DRL has a first-to-file (FTF) for this product in Canada and this seems to be its third review,” Nuvama noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that analysts have observed a few complex products getting approved after two review cycles. “Therefore, we are still building the product approval near the patent expiry,” Nuvama said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Analysts weigh impact on DRL’s earnings outlook</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, a report from Morgan Stanley said that success in Canada for generic semaglutide is a key driver for the firm’s FY27 earnings, with timely approval and launch crucial to staying on track.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Bank of America (BofA) stated that while the semaglutide approval may have been pushed out, it still expects the drug to be launched in the first half of FY27 (H1FY27) rather than being a lost opportunity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Dr Reddy has a filing in 87 countries and indicated confidence to sell all 12 million pens in FY27 even if Canada approval is delayed. This could offset the impact from the delay,” BofA added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>DRL confident in product quality and compliance</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn its part, DRL stated that it would submit a response to the NoN promptly and within the stipulated time frame.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We remain confident in the quality, safety and comparability of our proposed product and remain committed to making this important therapy available to patients in Canada and other markets at the earliest,” the company said in its regulatory filing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn Thursday, DRL’s shares dropped by 3.94 per cent, closing the day at ₹1,203.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</div></div>",
