            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tThe Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness programme if their work is deemed to have a substantial illegal purpose a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNew rules finalised Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organisations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration said it's necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the programme into a tool of political retribution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSet to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organisations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or chemical castration of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organisations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChemical castration is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt amounts to a major reworking of a programme that has cancelled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe programme \"was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service not to subsidise organisations that violate the law, whether by harbouring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex, Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new rules are weaponising loan forgiveness to make it harder for groups that work on issues like refugee and transgender rights, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Centre for Immigrant Rights.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLukens said many of the attorneys, social workers and paralegals who work at his organisation on deportation defence and other immigration litigation count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAll of a sudden, that's going away, Lukens said. The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn't, we're going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe programme promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits' tax status and their field of work.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe benefit has gone to workers at organisations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has misdirected tax dollars into activist organisations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organisation's work should be considered to have a substantial illegal purpose.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEmployers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the programme if a state or federal court rules against them, or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. Performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, appears to be grounds for expulsion.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEven without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organisation should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the preponderance of the evidence leans against the employer.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe department dismissed concerns from many who said that bar is too low.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers, federal officials wrote.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, simply because those attorneys' jobs were deemed politically unfavourable by the Secretary.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules based on their own priorities or ideology.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRep Tim Walberg, chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at radical organisations that violate state and federal laws.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. Those barred from the programme can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a corrective action plan approved by the secretary.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDocuments from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances. Not all organisations that break the law have a substantial illegal purpose, the agency said, and it ultimately comes down to the secretary's analysis of the evidence.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Those activities count as digital trade when the transactions cross national borders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile Trump wields tariffs to rebalance US deficits in merchandise trade, his push for a global internet free of import duties and other surcharges is aimed at ensuring the world’s largest economy remains the leading net exporter of e-services. That stands in contrast with the prior administration under Joe Biden, which was more sympathetic to European officials’ concerns about unfettered access to markets for US tech giants including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The Trump administration believes that our deficit in trade in goods has been unfairly imposed, but that our surplus in trade in services has been fairly earned” and wants to “maintain our services surplus, while reducing our goods deficit,” said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown Law in Washington. “I could understand why other countries would feel that this is itself unfair.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLast year, global exports of digitally delivered services increased to more than $4.77 trillion, a nearly 10 per cent jump from 2023 and more than double the growth in total goods and services trade, according to World Trade Organization and United Nations figures. It’s the fastest-growing segment of global goods and services trade that reached about $33 trillion last year.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSupercharging digital trade is artificial intelligence, raising questions for officials concerned about national security, data sovereignty, intellectual property abuse and consumer privacy protections as online services flow unchecked across borders. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFor some nations, it means a loss of government revenue as items formerly shipped as goods – a book or a movie, for example – are now sent digitally and out of reach of traditional customs duties.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs Trump tries to rewire the global trading system, digital commerce has become another battleground for geopolitical fragmentation where Washington and Beijing are jockeying for influence across Africa, Latin America and South Asia.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe new US provisions for Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand stand out because they call for long-term acceptance of an agreement forged at the WTO calling on all countries to refrain from putting tariffs on digital services.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAll three Southeast Asian economies agreed to support a permanent extension of the WTO accord known as the “moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAside from that initiative and another aimed at protecting fisheries, Washington has abandoned the WTO – the referee of the rules-based trading system for the past 30 years - in favor of Trump’s unilateral approach with so-called reciprocal tariffs.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\t\tGlobal Agreement</h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe WTO moratorium has been extended by consensus every two years since 1998, most recently in 2024 when it only was approved in a last-minute deal held up by objections from India. It comes up for renewal again heading into the Geneva-based organization’s ministerial meeting in March 2026 in Cameroon.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The commitments in the US deals to facilitate the free flow of data are absolutely welcome – especially when set against the trend for localization requirements that we’ve seen in recent years,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “While country-by-country progress is valuable, the ultimate goal should be to anchor these norms in a new international deal.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMalaysia’s accord with Trump included the additional concession that it will refrain from “requiring US social media platforms and cloud service providers to pay into Malaysia’s domestic fund.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe latest digital pacts by the US – plus a preliminary one with Vietnam that contains a vague pledge to finalize digital services commitments — follow a framework the US announced in July with Indonesia, whose customs agency had preemptively added a line for digital services in its harmonized tariff schedule, or HTS. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThat deal specified that “Indonesia has committed to eliminate existing HTS tariff lines on ‘intangible products’ and suspend related requirements on import declarations,” according to the White House document.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tUnder Trump, the US push for a permanent extension will have to address concerns from Brazil and India, both of which have faced some of the steepest US tariffs. In the past, both have wanted to preserve the option of raising revenue from foreign tech companies and protecting domestic e-commerce companies. Keeping the moratorium renewable also gave them leverage in other areas of trade.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“That extension looked very shaky after the last ministerial conference,” said Simon Evenett, a professor of geopolitics and strategy at IMD Business School in St. Gallen, Switzerland.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\t\tUS Big Tech</h3>\n<div>\r\n\t\tStill, he said, while the US uses its leverage to push for a permanent extension of the moratorium, “it’s too soon to say this represents broad-based WTO re-engagement — more likely, it’s selective engagement on a topic critical to US big tech.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDigital services provisions are part of most modern trade agreements, though the US and European Union have different views on the need for openness.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOfficials in Brussels want safeguards against anti-competitive behavior and stricter data privacy protections — oversight that US officials consider over-regulation. Some European countries have annoyed Washington by imposing taxes on digital services, viewing such moves as domestic fiscal policy that’s outside the scope of trade talks. French lawmakers earlier this week voted to double a tax on large technology companies, risking a backlash from Trump.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe US-EU trade framework dated Aug. 21 noted both sides “commit to address unjustified digital trade barriers” and will together pursue a permanent WTO’s e-commerce moratorium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMartina Ferracane, an associate professor of international digital trade at Teesside University in the UK, said another temporary extension is likelier than a permanent one because the US administration has “weakened its credibility” to lead a global consensus on the issue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tShe cited Trump’s pledge to put 100 per cent tariffs on films made outside the US as an example of a “threat of non-compliance” with the international ban on tariffs on digital commerce.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAnalysts remain cautiously optimistic on ITC’s outlook despite a muted September quarter of financial year 2026 (Q2FY26) performance, on the back of stable cigarette volumes, broad-based FMCG growth, and easing input costs that could lift margins in the second half of the year. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the Agri business continued to weigh on topline performance, analysts believe the worst of the headwinds are behind, setting the stage for gradual recovery across verticals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMuted quarter, but core performance steady</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tITC’s Q2 performance was subdued, with standalone revenue declining 3.4 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹18,020 crore, dragged down by a sharp 31 per cent drop in Agri business revenues. Excluding Agri, growth stood at a healthy 7 per cent Y-o-Y, driven by resilient performance in cigarettes and the non-cigarette FMCG segment. Ebitda rose 2.1 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹6,550 crore, while margins expanded 186 basis points (bps) Y-o-Y to 34.7 per cent, aided by cost discipline and an improved mix.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCigarette revenues grew 6.8 per cent Y-o-Y, implying a 6 per cent volume growth across most estimates. Analysts noted that while competitive intensity remains high, premium offerings and stable taxation helped sustain momentum. The non-cigarette FMCG business expanded around 7–8 per cent Y-o-Y, with strong showings in staples, dairy, and personal care products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCigarette momentum steady; margin pressure likely to ease</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost brokerages pointed to steady cigarette volumes but acknowledged continued pressure on profitability due to elevated leaf tobacco costs. According to Emkay Global, cigarette Ebit margins contracted 170bps Y-o-Y to 70.7 per cent, reflecting the gradual absorption of high-cost leaf tobacco inventories accumulated during FY23-24. However, with procurement prices moderating in the current crop cycle, analysts expect cost benefits to reflect meaningfully from FY27 onwards.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Containment of market share loss will be key for valuations,” Emkay noted, maintaining an ‘Add’ rating with a target price of ₹475. The brokerage expects cigarette earnings growth of around 6 per cent in FY26, accelerating to low double digits in FY27 as input costs normalize.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tICICI Securities echoed similar sentiment, highlighting stable category trends across the cigarette industry. “Ebit margins were impacted by higher leaf costs and rising competition, but sequential stability offers comfort,” it said. The brokerage sees easing input costs and a healthy product mix supporting margin recovery in H2FY26. It maintained an ‘Add’ rating with a DCF-based target price of ₹450.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama Institutional Equities also underscored the steady 6 per cent cigarette volume growth and rising contribution from premium offerings. “Improved mix and operating leverage helped lift Ebitda margin by 186bps Y-o-Y to 34.7 per cent,” it said, adding that ITC’s dominance with over 75 per cent market share positions it well to defend its leadership despite intensifying competition. The brokerage cut FY27-28 earnings estimates marginally and revised its target price to ₹534 (from ₹540 earlier), maintaining a ‘Buy’ rating.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tFMCG resilience continues; Agri and Paper weigh on growth</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBrokerages were unanimous that the non-cigarette FMCG business remains a bright spot in ITC’s portfolio. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal said FMCG sales grew 8.5 per cent Y-o-Y, led by strong demand for staples, snacks, and personal care products, though notebook sales continued to weigh on growth. “Consistent focus on new launches, stable taxes, and a recovery in consumption are expected to drive momentum from H2FY26,” it said.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAcross brokerages, analysts noted that digital-first and organic brands such as Yogabar, Mother Sparsh, Prasuma, Meatigo, and 24 Mantra clocked annualised revenue run-rates (ARR) of over ₹1,100 crore, underscoring ITC’s growing presence in premium and health-conscious categories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Agri business, however, remained the biggest drag, down 31 per cent Y-o-Y due to a high base and shipment delays amid US tariff uncertainty. While segment Ebit was flat Y-o-Y, margins expanded sharply due to a favourable mix. The Paperboards and Packaging division grew 5 per cent Y-o-Y in revenue but faced a 21 per cent Ebit decline due to low-priced imports and elevated wood costs, though sequential performance improved as domestic demand recovered.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts see recovery from H2FY26</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite short-term weakness, most brokerages see earnings momentum strengthening into the second half of FY26 as commodity inflation eases and demand recovers. Stable cigarette taxation and improving cost dynamics are expected to cushion margins, while FMCG and Paper segments should benefit from normalised input prices and policy support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Portfolio balance, stable taxation, and disciplined execution reinforce earnings resilience,” ICICI Securities said. Those at Motilal Oswal added that cigarette Ebit margins are likely to improve from Q4FY26, with paper margins bottoming out. The brokerage has maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of 515.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, the <em>Street’s</em> tone remains constructive. Analysts agree that while ITC’s Q2 was muted, the company’s diversified portfolio, strong cash flows, and easing cost headwinds set the stage for a steady recovery ahead.</div></div>",
