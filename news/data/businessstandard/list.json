Just as mutual funds and insurance became household names, alternatives are following suit.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Jain, the next phase of growth will hinge on domestic capital pools connecting India’s deep savings ecosystem with private equity and venture capital. “Every large economy eventually funds itself domestically. India is reaching that stage,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tMarket-beating returns</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra, partner at Samara Capital, highlighted that private equity has consistently outperformed public markets globally, and India’s story mirrors that trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Globally, PE has outperformed public markets by about 6–7 per cent on a 10-year rolling basis,” he said. “In India, deal flow has picked up sharply. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices are increasing allocations to alternative funds — from 7–8 per cent now to a projected 15–16 per cent.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe identified three pillars driving mainstreaming: fundraising, deal flow, and exits. “We now have vibrant opportunities in growth capital, buyouts, and even secondary exits. IPOs, domestic M&amp;As, SME listings — all of these complete a healthy investment cycle,” Kabra added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExits and buyouts mark a new phase</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKedaara Capital’s founder and managing partner Kejriwal said India’s “sweet spot” stems from improved exit markets and a cultural shift among family-owned businesses. “Fifteen years ago, India was good at attracting capital but not returning it,” he said. “That’s changed. We’ve had robust IPOs, sponsor-to-sponsor sales, and rising acceptance among business families to sell strategic stakes. Selling is no longer seen as a mark of shame,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuyouts, once rare, now account for half of all private equity deals, noted Gopalakrishnan. “In 2013, buyouts made up just 20 per cent of the market. With succession planning more common and the economy larger, both the pool of opportunities and transaction sizes have risen.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s scale advantage</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India becomes the world’s fifth-largest economy, global investors are paying closer attention. “Private equity works in large and sophisticated economies,” said Gaja Capital’s Jain. “Until recently, India was neither large nor sophisticated enough. That’s changed. We now have the scale, entrepreneurs, and IPO markets to support sustained private equity growth.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKejriwal added that while India remains an “entrepreneurial country of immense depth”, the PE industry is still at the level of a cottage industry. “We’ve barely scratched the surface. The best years are yet to come,” he predicted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI and the next investment wave</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn whether artificial intelligence (AI) will reshape investment patterns, Kejriwal struck a cautious tone: “We’re not chasing the AI hype. For us, the focus is on how our portfolio companies adopt AI efficiently, rather than betting on untested products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is a constant game of adapting. Our job is to future-proof the businesses we invest in,” said Gopalakrishnan.</div></div>",

The discussion among India’s top treasury and markets heads centred on how fund managers, policymakers, and investors are balancing liquidity, growth, and financial risk amid an evolving macroeconomic landscape.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tGlobal markets show resilience amid uncertainty</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAditya Bagree, managing director and head – markets, India &amp; South Asia at Citi, believe global equity markets have held up surprisingly well despite multiple shocks in recent years. “There have been several events over the past three to four years that could easily have caused global turmoil. Yet, the global economy and markets have held up remarkably well. Much of that is due to strong policy support and new growth drivers like AI investments,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBagree pointed out three key trends shaping the United States economy: high unemployment rate, concerns about inflation due to Trump tariffs, and the concentration of growth in AI-related sectors, such as data centres and energy infrastructure. He said while the US is likely to begin its rate-cutting cycle soon, it is likely to be gradual and spread across the coming year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><div class=\"wrap-iframe\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6obc_-n7QXU?si=NKrM0nnFmfxa-ozJ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI driving growth</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tShailendra Jhingan, head – treasury &amp; economic research at <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/icici-bank-ltd-share-price-5418.html\" target=\"_blank\">ICICI Bank</a> agreed that AI-driven investments are underpinning current growth in the US, though this growth is narrowly concentrated. “Almost two-thirds of US GDP growth in the first half of the year came from AI-related investments, not just in chips but in power, air conditioning, and supporting infrastructure,” Jhingan said. “However, weak labour market means weak consumption, and that is a real concern.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile Jhingan expects the US Federal Reserve to cut rates to support employment, he warned that inflationary pressures could return once corporates begin passing on higher tariff costs to consumers. “So far, US corporations have absorbed most of the cost increases, but that can’t continue indefinitely,” he added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the wave of AI-led investment was also leading to layoffs in some technology sectors, pointed out Arup Rakshit, group head – treasury, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/hdfc-bank-ltd-share-price-4987.html\" target=\"_blank\">HDFC Bank</a>. “Job losses are becoming visible, and that’s another reason rate cuts are likely to begin soon,” he said. Rakshit expects the US Fed to pause after two or three cuts to reassess the inflation trend.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s growth outlook and policy support</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tTurning to India, Jhingan said the need for aggressive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appears limited at this stage. “Growth indicators are improving, liquidity remains stable, and fiscal measures, including tax relief and capital expenditure, have already provided a cushion,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that RBI’s earlier 100 basis point rate cut, combined with ₹7.4 trillion liquidity infusion, has already begun showing impact. “We are seeing early signs of capex recovery. So, while RBI may opt for another rate cut in December, the broader stance will likely be to pause and observe,” Jhingan said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBagree echoed the sentiment, noting that while India’s inflation remains comfortably within the target range, the case for another rate cut remains debatable. “Inflation has averaged around 2.3 per cent this year, and the rural economy has held up well. Between monetary easing, fiscal incentives, and GST cuts, enough stimulus has already been injected,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRakshit of HDFC Bank added that the RBI might still go ahead with a “symbolic rate cut” in December, particularly if the US begins easing. “If inflation numbers remain benign and the festive momentum sustains, a rate cut in December becomes more likely,” he said.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tFPI flows: Passive money stable, active money cautious</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn foreign portfolio flows, panellists at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit agreed that while passive inflows into Indian debt have been steady following the JP Morgan index inclusion, active flows remain strategic and rate-sensitive.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAditya Bagree of Citi pointed out that Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) currently hold only about 3.2 per cent of outstanding Indian government paper, with room for growth if Bloomberg includes Indian bonds in its global index next year. “The trend in FPI flows into emerging market debt remains strong, as emerging markets today have better fiscal and inflation metrics than many developed economies,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“On the equity side, we’ve seen around $15–16 billion in outflows this year, largely due to concerns around corporate profitability, valuations, and tariff uncertainties. Interestingly, much of the global equity capital has moved to AI-linked markets such as China and South Korea. We expect that as tariff concerns fade, growth stabilises, and valuations normalise, equity flows will start returning to India,” Bagree said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRakshit agreed, saying, “Passive flows will continue, but foreign money will not dictate Indian yields as domestic investors will remain the main driver.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCorporate bonds lose steam</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe panel also spoke about the slowdown in corporate bond issuance as companies increasingly turn to the loan market. Jhingan said, “With repo-linked loan rates proving cheaper than corporate bonds, corporate bond issuances have dipped from ₹3.6 trillion in the first quarter to ₹2 trillion later.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBagree drove the conversation to India’s bond market that continues to be dominated by domestic institutional investors such as mutual funds, insurance companies, and banks. “The bond market in India is largely driven by domestic institutional investors. Demand has eased recently due to certain regulatory and tax changes, raising the question of how we can revive that appetite,” Bagree said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRakshit added that accounting changes and the revised large exposure framework have further dampened demand for corporate bonds. “The loan market offers more flexibility and lower costs, so the preference shift is evident,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tThe rupee outlook</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tTalking about rupee, Bagree acknowledged recent underperformance but attributed it largely to seasonal factors such as education and defence outflows during the July–September quarter.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This quarter is typically weak for the rupee, but we expect some recovery as portfolio inflows return and seasonal outflows ease,” he said. “Foreign investors have been underweight on India, but improving corporate profitability and global rate cuts could change that.”<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <em><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/video-gallery/general/business-standard-bfsi-summit-2025-177986.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Catch all coverage of the Business Standard BFSI Summit 2025 Day 1 here.</a></em></div></div>",

Despite a promising start, the middle order crumbled under the pressure of Subrayen’s relentless accuracy and subtle variations.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTeenager Ayush Mhatre (65 off 76 balls) was the only batter to stand tall amid the ruins. His knock, filled with elegant strokes including a crisp straight drive off Okuhle Cele and a flowing cover drive off Subrayen, reflected sound technique and maturity beyond his years.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/teen-cricketer-ben-austin-dies-after-training-accident-in-melbourne-125103100917_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Teen cricketer Ben Austin dies after training accident in Melbourne</a></strong></div>\n</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Pant’s Short Stay and India’s Middle-Order Collapse</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRishabh Pant, returning to competitive cricket after three months, had a mixed outing. He impressed behind the stumps but couldn’t translate that success with the bat. The left-hander’s 17 came off 29 minutes, featuring two trademark boundaries and a few rash shots. His dismissal, caught by Zubayr Hamza at gully after indecision against Subrayen, summed up India’s erratic batting effort.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOpener Sai Sudharsan (38 off 94) struggled to find fluency and was eventually caught behind off Tshepo Moreki. Devdutt Padikkal and Rajat Patidar perished cheaply to loose strokes, deepening India’s woes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Subrayen’s Discipline and Badoni’s Late Fight</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSubrayen’s control was the defining factor of the day. Bowling unchanged for long spells, the 32-year-old extracted sharp turn and bounce, dismantling India’s middle order. His efforts were complemented by tidy spells from Moreki and Cele.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAyush Badoni’s brisk 38 off 47 offered brief resistance, reducing the deficit below 100 before he too fell in an attacking attempt. By stumps, South Africa A had reasserted their dominance, with Jordan Hermann (12)* and Lesego Senokwane (9)* guiding them safely to 30 without loss.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Day to Forget for India A</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor India A, it was a day of missed opportunities. After restricting the visitors early, they failed to build on momentum with the bat. With South Africa A already 105 runs ahead and nine wickets in hand, India A’s bowlers face a daunting task on Day 3 to claw their way back into the match.<small
