Given the size and scale, availability of land/necessary resources, there is a huge opportunity for India to attract investments from large digital players to set up data centres in India through their subsidiaries/affiliates,” it said, warning that lack of clarity could deter multinational investment.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that Indian subsidiaries providing such services should get a safe harbour regime with prescribed margins, given the long gestation period for data centre projects.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSafe harbour should be effective from the date of operationalisation and applicable for at least 15 years, the chamber argued. It added that costs related to foreign affiliates’ technology or data stored in India should be excluded while computing margins.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn easing business rules for digital firms, Assocham sought removal of non-digital transactions such as import of goods from the scope of SEP.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt said the provision currently could force Indian businesses to deduct tax even where the non-resident has no physical or digital presence in India.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt urged the government to issue attribution guidelines and exempt taxpayers eligible for treaty benefits from SEP reporting.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAssocham stated that “consequently, any Indian resident who makes payments to non-residents who have SEP in India may be obligated to withhold tax prior to making payment, to such non-residents” which creates uncertainty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo support domestic reorganisation, the chamber said fast-track mergers and demergers under the Companies Act be granted tax neutrality.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt added that a blanket denial compels companies to avail the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) route only and the fast-track route will be futile.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also pushed for expanding tax-neutral treatment to all forms of entity conversions and for allowing loss carry-forward under such restructurings.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThese should be simplified and expanded so as to enable businesses and investors to optimise their operations and holdings without facing tax costs, it said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn manufacturing, Assocham urged the government to revive the 15 per cent concessional corporate tax regime for new units to sustain investments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis will enable India to remain attractive for making fresh capital investment, provide a boost to the domestic economy and also encourage exports, it argued.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAddressing stressed-asset resolutions, the chamber sought exemption for loan waivers granted under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), stressing that taxing waived debt “goes contrary to the purpose behind the IBC.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also requested clarity on depreciation for assets partly used for business.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAssocham asked that write-off of receivables be excluded from TDS under Section 194R, stating that requiring tax deduction on irrecoverable amounts is “doubly onerous” for creditors.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor small entrepreneurs and the agriculture ecosystem, Assocham argued that farmers and farmer-producer organisations should be exempt from TDS on e-commerce transactions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt said the current rule imposes an undue burden on farmers, especially where platforms do not handle billing or collection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe chamber also sought alignment of tax treatment of government subsidies with actual cash receipt to ease liquidity pressure on companies, observing that “actual receipt generally takes two to three years.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo spur hiring, it proposed raising the salary threshold for claiming deduction on new employees to ₹50,000 per month and extending the incentive to contractual workers, saying employment generation is a key issue for the country and the limits fixed in 2016 are outdated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn transfer pricing, Assocham urged restoration of the earlier definition of associated enterprises, warning that the current language could trigger disputes merely on account of participation in management or capital.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFinally, the chamber made a strong pitch for speeding up dispute adjudication and widening safe harbours. Advance rulings should be delivered within defined timelines, it said, while seeking broader coverage for safe harbours and raising the limit for the dispute resolution committee from ₹10 lakh to ₹50 lakh to encourage more small taxpayers to opt for it.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

The import duty on yellow peas was scrapped in December 2023, and the results were there to see immediately.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to trade sources, mandi prices of chana rose by ₹50-100 per quintal on Thursday in most markets due to the import duty while that of tur rose by ₹25-50 per quintal.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThere was no change in mandi prices of urad between Wednesday and Thursday while masur rates rose by almost ₹100 per quintal between the two days.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe maximum rise was seen in mandi prices of yellow peas, which moved up by ₹150-325 per quintal from around ₹3,500 per quintal to around ₹3,800 per quintal between the two days.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The landed price of yellow peas, which was ₹32-33 per kg, will immediately go up for new shipments by almost ₹9 per kg.

The plan is being implemented in Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh for kharif 2025-26.

Partnering with TenneT and Hitachi Energy for this pioneering programme underscores the confidence our customers place in L&amp;T’s growing capability to execute complex, technology-intensive infrastructure projects.”</div>\n<div>\r\n\tTenneT, one of Europe’s largest power transmission system operators, is investing around $33 billion to develop 14 offshore grid connections across the German and Dutch parts of the North Sea. These systems will collectively transmit power from 40 Gw of offshore wind farms to onshore grids by 2031.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe 14 projects are split among four major consortiums including GE-McDermott, Siemens Energy-Dragados, Hitachi Energy-L&amp;T, and GE-Sembcorp. Each of the 14 grid connections will use HVDC technology to efficiently transmit electricity over long distances, minimizing energy loss. A key condition of the TenneT contracts is that core components must be manufactured within European production sites.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe development is expected to add value to L&amp;T’s international EPC portfolio, particularly in the clean energy and transmission segment. L&amp;T’s consolidated order book stood at Rs 6.67 trillion as of September 30, 2025, up 30.69 per cent.
