To paraphrase a remark often attributed to Leon Trotsky, centrist economists may not be interested in war, but war is interested in them.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tMy 2016 book The Curse of Cash, which explored the past, present, and future of money, is a case in point. After its publication, I received more than 20 death threats, some clearly from drug dealers and gun owners outraged by my call to phase out $100 bills, and others from crypto evangelists who considered my support for regulation an act of treason.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOddly enough, I didn’t mind the threats as much as one might expect. As unhinged as some of these people were, at least they had understood the book’s arguments; they just vehemently disagreed with them.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe same cannot be said of the 2013 uproar over my work with Carmen M Reinhart. That episode began when three University of Massachusetts Amherst economists argued that our six-page 2010 conference paper “Growth in a Time of Debt” contained multiple “errors” that had supposedly misled policymakers in Europe and the United States into adopting harmful austerity measures in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The ensuing outrage fostered a false narrative that persists to this day.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn reality, our paper contained only a single error. Critically, that error did not appear in the full-length edited journal version, published in 2012, which was based on a much larger and more complete dataset. As Stanford’s Michael J Boskin observed at the time, it is hardly unusual for preliminary research to undergo corrections during the revision process.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tBoth versions of the paper reached the same general conclusion: Across advanced economies, periods of very high public debt tend to coincide with slower economic growth. Of course, this finding does not mean that running deficits harms short-term growth any more than borrowing to buy something you enjoy makes you unhappy. It simply means that the long-term burden of debt can weigh on future prosperity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOur analysis divided countries into two groups: Those with debt levels over 90 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and those below. But the 90 per cent mark was never a “threshold” where growth suddenly collapses; it was merely a divide to illustrate that high-debt countries as a group underperform, on average. As we explained repeatedly, having debt reach 90 per cent of GDP does not imply growth collapse any more than people who drive slightly over the speed limit or whose cholesterol levels are just above the recommended range see a sudden jump in risk.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThere are solid theoretical reasons why high debt can impede growth. Heavy government borrowing can crowd out private investment, while the taxes required to service that debt are often distortionary. And when debt is already high, governments have less fiscal space to respond to crises or invest in infrastructure. Once the controversy subsided and researchers began examining our data, along with newer datasets, the evidence that emerged largely supported our original conclusions.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe most pernicious misrepresentation was that we somehow advocated austerity, when neither the concept nor the word appeared anywhere in our work. In truth, our real offence was suggesting that there might be a tradeoff between debt and growth. While stimulating the economy during a downturn is important, the size of the stimulus needs to be calibrated, especially if it leads to very high debt.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn fact, our 2009 book This Time Is Different (written before we later tackled debt and growth) showed that financial crises almost always necessitate a sharp increase in government debt. We argued that governments facing debt crises have often resorted to heterodox solutions rather than relying solely on conventional monetary and fiscal measures. I also advocated partial debt forgiveness for US subprime borrowers and for highly indebted southern European economies.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn the early stages of the 2008 crisis, I even proposed that central banks temporarily relax their inflation targets as a less painful way to deleverage their economies — an idea that was considered blasphemous at the time but has since gained traction. Do these ideas and proposals amount to promoting austerity, or do they recognise a richer menu of policy options than the crude Keynesianism that has dominated too much of the debate, even to this day?</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tPerhaps this time is different. Having grown accustomed to misrepresentation as the price of taking centrist positions in the age of cancel culture, I have been pleasantly surprised by the reception of my latest book, Our Dollar, Your Problem. Reviewers, interviewers, and commentators from across the ideological spectrum have engaged with it seriously, appreciating its analysis of the strengths and vulnerabilities of our dollar-based global financial system.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tRemarkably, this open-mindedness has extended even to some critics from the austerity camp. That makes me think that perhaps there is hope for more reasonable discussions in the future — though I’m not holding my breath.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<hr/>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t    </div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<em><strong>The author is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University  ©Project Syndicate, 2025</strong></em></div></div>",

In a fireside chat with <strong>Tamal Bandyopadhyay</strong>, he talks of various aspects of Sebi’s functioning. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>At your very first board meeting, you spoke about building public trust and sorting out conflict of interest. How do you settle issues and conflicts — not just in the market but also within Sebi? Where are we today on these issues?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIt’s important to understand that Sebi is an institution. It has been nurtured and developed by several of my predecessors, along with industry and market participants, through collaboration. Today, Sebi has a strong reputation not only in India but also overseas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tTrust is critical, both internally and externally. It does not come from a single measure — there is no magic wand. It stems from a series of actions: Our language, how we communicate, our regulatory framework, and a fair and judicious application of regulations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier there was concern over whether we had a robust internal framework on managing conflict of interest. We had set up a high-level committee on this aspect. The committee has been deliberating on the matter and engaging with several internal and external stakeholders. I expect its report to be submitted in a few days, possibly by November 10. We will take the next steps, based on its recommendations.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>We have never had any five-year period during which foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sold so much. Is it only about valuation, or is there something else?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the basis of my interaction with FPIs and other participants in foreign markets, I find their confidence in India remains high. They believe in India’s long-term growth story and also see short-term opportunities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFPIs’ market capitalisation in India is about $900 billion. They allocate across global markets and assess where they can get the best returns. So, an outflow of $45 billion in the past year — with some months of positive flows and some negative — must be seen in proportion. The outflow of $45 billion on a base of $900 billion is not very significant.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, FPIs have given feedback on improving access, simplifying processes, and addressing pain points. We are working on those. We have simplified and digitised FPI registration.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India has one of the largest primary markets, but you recently reduced the size of a minimum public offer (MPO) in an IPO and the minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirement for listed companies. Is there a disconnect?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLet me clarify: We have not diluted the norms on MPS. MPS remains at 25 per cent — unchanged. What we examined was the MPO and the time allowed for companies to achieve MPS.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe markets have expanded. After the IPO of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), we began discussing companies with a ₹6 trillion market cap coming to the market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStrict timelines on MPS can act like a Damocles’ sword, potentially hurting minority shareholders due to price volatility. So, we took a realistic view of what the market can absorb. After extensive consultations and excellent feedback, we introduced multiple pathways to achieving compliance on MPS and MPO, without compromising on investor protection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>MFs enjoy a tax advantage over portfolio management services and alternative investment funds. That's one side of the story. On the other hand, while the Reserve Bank of India is paving the way for banks to lend more to earn more interest income, Sebi is limiting the sources of MF income. Yes, I am referring to the new discussion paper on the expense ratio ...</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs are critical for retail participation. We have 56 million unique investors. The industry has grown rapidly but is still 20-25 per cent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP). In advanced economies, MFs’ assets under management are 80-85 per cent of GDP.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs must grow faster because they provide a safer way for retail investors to enter the market and promote long-term investing. Their tax status is aligned with that structure — it is a pass-through model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MF industry has grown significantly and become more professional. We cannot constrain it. That is why we introduced options like specialised investment funds and other reforms, allowing more activities with appropriate risk segregation. Simplifying regulations has been a key objective. Some proposals on the fee structure stem from the need for greater clarity, fairness, and transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi research shows 90-93 per cent of individual investors lose money in F&amp;Os. There has been so much discussion on easing out weekly F&amp;Os. When will we see that?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a sensitive subject and requires thoughtful handling. We adopted a calibrated approach and implemented a series of measures to improve the market after five rounds of consultation. Initially, we received diverse views, which we reconciled.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome measures have taken effect; others will kick in as late as December 1. Some began in October, some in July, and more are scheduled for May 2026. We have introduced guardrails — limiting expiries to only two days a week and one index per day — to curb irrational exuberance among retail investors less aware of the workings of the market. Statutory warnings have also been included on the trading screen.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the same time, many market participants actively use derivatives products. We cannot abruptly shut down the market. Therefore, any further steps will be released for public consultation. Stakeholders can evaluate the data and provide feedback before we proceed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will the IPO of the National Stock Exchange see the light of day during your tenure?</strong></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> Of course, unless you want my tenure to be very short.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you take us through Sebi’s “30-second cyber-security check”?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is an important initiative by Sebi. With support from market participants, banks, and others, we have developed a unique system — the first of its kind globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia is a global leader in Unified Payments Interface and digital public infrastructure. With 45-50 per cent of the world’s digital transactions happening in India, convenience is high, but that also enables fraudsters. Our objective is to end the ease of doing fraud. We must protect millions of investors at scale.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMany people spend time choosing vegetables or comparing products, but not even 30 seconds checking if their securities account is secure. The “30-Second Check” on Sebi’s Saarthi app enables users to quickly verify bank-account linkage, demat-account security, MF statements, the validity of the advisor or intermediary, and whether any unauthorised transfer or pledge has taken place.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a systemic, preventive effort — unique globally. The aim is for current and potential investors to be aware so that they do not lose money. Market risk is understood — but fraud risk must be avoided.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the latest on finfluencers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe are doing around 5,000 takedowns every month, and have taken down over 100,000 pieces of content from platforms with support from Google, Meta, and others. With better tools and platforms deploying artificial intelligence more effectively, we should be able to act even more forcefully.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi has gained more teeth over the years. Do you need additional powers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have adequate powers. We must use them judiciously, sensibly, and consistently. We also need to keep upgrading our surveillance tools — which we are doing. If we have done well, we must do even better. If we keep exercising these powers responsibly, we will continue to maintain public trust in the capital markets — because as a watchdog, that is our duty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You recently launched an e-office in Sebi. Is that correct?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat’s correct. Sebi was, I admit, late in adopting it. This will strengthen efficiency in the organisation. I can say we are fortunate to have some of the finest minds at Sebi.</div></div>",

Their deals were a relief to a world economy rattled by trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump's decision to skip APEC fits with his well-known disdain for big, multi-nation forums that have been traditionally used to address global problems. But his blunt dismissal of APEC risks worsening America's reputation at a forum that represents nearly 40 per cent of the world's population and more than half of global goods trade.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tXi defends multilateralism<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“The more turbulent the times, the more we must work together,” Xi said during APEC's opening session. \"The world is undergoing a period of rapid change, with the international situation becoming increasingly complex and volatile.” Xi called for maintaining supply chain stability, in a riposte to US efforts to decouple its supply chains from China.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tXi also expressed hopes to work with other countries to expand cooperation in green industries and clean energy. Chinese exports of its solar panels, electric vehicles and other green tech have been criticised for creating oversupplies and undercutting the domestic industries of countries it exports to.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIt's Xi's first visit to South Korea in 11 years. On the sidelines of the summit, Xi had bilateral meetings with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Friday. Xi is to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for a meeting expected to discuss North Korea's nuclear program.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tUS Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, who attended the summit on Trump's behalf, said a US move to rebalance its trade relationships would ensure that “each country operates on fair and reciprocal terms.” He added that the US is \"investing with its trading partners to build resilient production networks that reduce dependence on vulnerable sectors.\"<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAPEC faces challenges<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tEstablished in 1989 during a period of increased globalisation, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to accelerate regional economic integration. But the APEC region now faces challenges like strategic competitions between the US and China, supply chain vulnerabilities, ageing populations and the impact of AI on jobs. The US strategy has shifted to economic competition with China rather than cooperation, with Trump's tariff hikes and “America first” agenda shaking markets and threatening decades of globalisation and multinationalism.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tLeaders and other representatives from 21 Asia-Pacific Rim economies are attending the APEC meeting to discuss how to promote economic cooperation and tackle shared challenges. Opening the summit as chair, Lee called for greater cooperation and solidarity to overcome new challenges.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“It's obvious that we can't always stand on the same side, as our national interests are at stake. But we can join together for the ultimate goal of shared prosperity,\" Lee said. “I hope we will have candid and constructive discussions on how we can achieve APEC's vision in the face of the new challenge of a rapidly changing international economic environment.\" Carney reiterated his government's plan to double its non-US exports in the next decade, as he said that “our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall.” Despite Trump's optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the countries, with both seeking dominant places in manufacturing and developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“It is certainly a contribution to bring the leaders of the two largest economies together for a meeting where they agreed to withdraw their most extreme tariff and export control threats. As a result, worst-case outcomes for global trade were averted,” said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“However, APEC is meant to be more than a venue for a trade war truce,” Easley said. “Greater multilateral efforts are needed to address the region's most pressing economic challenges, including resisting costly and destabilising protectionism, harmonising regulations for sustainable trade, and coordinating standards for digital innovation.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tHost South Korea pushes for a joint statement South Korean officials said they've been communicating with other countries to prod all 21 members to adopt a joint statement at the end of the summit so as not to repeat the failure to issue one in 2018 in Papua New Guinea due to US-China discord over trade.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said last week that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members.

He spoke about the delicate balancing act regulators must perform between avoiding “type 1” errors (allowing market failures) and “type 2” errors (over-regulating and stifling growth).

Since turning bullish in 2014, Desai said India’s economic transformation, including a sharp reduction in oil dependency and a shrinking current account deficit, has fundamentally strengthened its market resilience. He cautioned investors that equities require a long-term horizon of at least five years to navigate volatility, adding that being bullish does not guarantee annual positive returns.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHis insights emphasised patience and conviction in India’s evolving economic narrative.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMark Matthews, managing director and head of research for Asia at Julius Baer, described 2025 as a surprising year for global markets, with strong rallies in the US and emerging markets versus India’s moderate returns. He attributed India’s relative underperformance to China’s return as an investable market and disappointing corporate earnings growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Matthews remains optimistic about India nearing an inflection point, supported by GST cuts, monetary easing and fiscal incentives that could reignite double-digit earnings growth by the 2027 financial year. He also highlighted exuberance around AI-related tech stocks but warned of frothy valuations, while still projecting possible market gains in the coming year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShankar Sharma, founder of GQuants, shared how AI has reshaped his investment strategy, shifting to an 80-90 per cent data and AI-driven approach, allowing him to identify opportunities at scale. However, he expressed caution about AI’s overuse, particularly in contrarian thinking, warning that AI-generated answers often reinforce existing biases. Sharma said he does not foresee AI completely replacing human judgment in investing, as human intervention remains essential to maintain perspective and balance. He emphasised AI’s role as a tool rather than a substitute for investor intuition.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChief investment officers (CIOs) from leading mutual funds urged investors to maintain realistic return expectations and stay disciplined despite a challenging year marked by weak performance.

They advised investors to look for bottom-up opportunities and to focus on fundamentals, disciplined investing and risk management in an environment lacking obvious thematic plays. They also pushed for prioritising long-term returns over short-term valuations. The panel acknowledged that the current market phase reflects a return to normalcy after the post-pandemic bull run and advocated cautious optimism.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLeaders from the broking industry described the current period as a strategic reset following two years of rapid account openings and retail activity.

Speaking at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit 2025, the industry’s top executives, however, chose to describe it as a much-needed reboot for the next phase of growth rather than a reset.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia’s broking industry is now transitioning into a more stable and strategically focussed growth cycle after two extraordinary years of record account openings and peak retail activity in cash and derivatives segment. Trading patterns are normalising, new regulatory frameworks are being absorbed, and brokerages — both discount and full-service — are reshaping their business models for scale and sustainability. Far from viewing this as a slowdown, industry leaders see it as an essential reset that will unlock the next decade of expansion.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry leaders were unanimous in their view that “reboot” will prepare the ecosystem for deeper participation, higher-quality users, and more enduring revenue pools. This will go a long way in creating the next growth cycle, given that penetration is still low and the Indian economy and household income continue to grow at a steady pace.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Long-term fundamentals remain exceptionally strong. While 63 per cent of Indian households are aware of capital markets, only 9.5 per cent currently invest — a gap that represents the industry’s most exciting opportunity. The awareness engine is built. Now the next 52 of the households are our growth runway,” said Kotak Securities’ Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD&amp;CEO) Shripal Shah.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tExecutives emphasised that retail participation will now expand in a steadier, more predictable manner — driven by income growth, better financial literacy, and maturing investor behaviour. Unlike the Covid-era surge, the upcoming growth trajectory is expected to mirror structural patterns seen in China and other large markets.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Axis Securities’ MD&amp;CEO Pranav Haridasan, the next challenge for the industry is to increase the penetration further from current levels. “I think in the US probably 55-60 per cent of the households have demat or a brokerage account. This figure is closer to 20 per cent in China. So, the penetration really depends on per capita gross domestic product (GDP), and penetration starts to rise as affluence and incomes move,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said it’s good that the non-institutional parts of speculative activities, including derivatives trading, are getting tightened increasingly, as “we saw with some of the other areas of online gaming and so on”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The markets are perhaps moving towards a structure where people make genuinely skill-based decisions. Besides, we're all moving towards value of the transaction from just account opening. There is room to grow but it will happen in a secular and steady basis rather than in a spurt as we have seen in the past,” added Haridasan.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to PL Capital Group Chairperson and MD Amisha Vora, the past two years have also brought a decisive shift towards stronger compliance, cyber-resilience, and risk controls. Brokerages are investing heavily in secure KYC (know your customer) systems, surveillance tools, and multi-layered cybersecurity — upgrades that improve trust and long-term investor confidence.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Technology is now embedded across onboarding, risk management and behaviour analytics. Firms are increasingly aligning product offerings with the right customer cohorts — SIP-led beginners, midcap traders, and long-term wealth builders — supported by data-driven segmentation,” noted Vora.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShe added that more than half of all new accounts are now opened by individuals under 30 — a demographic that is only at the beginning of its income and wealth-creation journey. As this cohort matures, its long-term equity allocation will rise sharply, fuelling growth in the industry.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Motilal Oswal Retail Wealth MD&amp;CEO Ajay Menon, in the pre-Covid period, the primary challenge for the industry was to bring in new investors, but now that the investor base has more than quadrupled to over 20 crore, the industry has to transition them to long-term investors. “We like to position ourselves from an advisory capability, from a research capability to see that new entrants are advised to do the right things, are given the right kind of products, and are moved from trading to investment,” said Menon.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that instant gratification makes a lot of difference to young investors/traders, but the industry’s responsibility is to convince them that the journey to a sustainable long-term growth in portfolio has to be different.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe industry leaders observed that digital-first discount brokers reshaped the industry in recent years, but full-service players are making a quiet comeback with user-friendly apps and frictionless onboarding. The competitive edge, executives said, will come from research quality, advisory depth, and long-term relationship-building.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Kotak Securities’ Shah, margin trading funding (MTF) is one of the fastest-growing revenue pools for the full-service brokers now — valued at nearly ₹1.1 trillion and expanding steadily. “We see MTF as a responsible, equity-focused leverage product that diversifies income beyond derivatives,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExecutives said that nearly 60 per cent of new account openings now come from North and East India — regions that previously lagged in equity participation. While trading intensity is rising with the rise in disposable incomes, the trend underscores the broadening reach of India’s capital markets.</div></div>",

In a fireside chat with <strong>A K Bhattacharya</strong> of Business Standard, he says markets may not generate positive returns every year, while advising that investors should invest in equities with a long-term horizon. Edited excerpts:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You are called an ‘India bull’. Let me flip the question, have you ever been bearish on India? When and under what circumstances?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn January 2007, I wrote a report titled ‘Skating on Thin Ice’, where I predicted that the Sensex would drop to around 11,000 from about 15,000. Of course, I was premature because the market surged to 22,000 in the following year before crashing back to 11,000 by the end of 2008. So, my call was a bit early.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 2007, I was genuinely concerned about the relentless appetite for IPOs, inflated market valuations, and stretched earnings.</div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\tThe profit share of GDP had peaked, signalling that margins were topping out. I believed earnings growth would slow, IPO excesses would create technical challenges, and valuations would correct. However, the global bull market delayed this until January 2008, when the decline finally materialised. I was bearish then.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\n<strong>So when did you turn bullish?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tI had some concerns in 2013, but it was a brief cycle. Since 2014, I have been bullish. This year marks the 11th year of my bullishness. That does not mean the market will generate positive returns every year. I often remind people that equities are the longest-duration asset class and require a long-term perspective. Unlike fixed deposits or bonds, a minimum five-year view is essential. If you can’t commit to that, three years is the bare minimum. Holding equities less than 12 months? Good luck.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>From being bearish to maintaining a long-term bullish view, what has changed? What macro variables underpin this constructive outlook today?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tA fundamental shift has occurred in India, often misunderstood. It relates to our savings deficit or current account deficit — the gap between savings and investment rates. Historically, India had a higher investment rate than saving rate, leading to a current account deficit of 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent. This was largely because India had little to export and relied heavily on importing energy, especially oil.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe current account deficit was mainly funded by capital market flows, primarily equity, since foreign direct investment (FDI) was limited. Setting up manufacturing units in India was complicated, so multinationals preferred acquisitions. The equity market flows were cyclical and often reversed during global recessions, leaving India vulnerable.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 2008, India was not directly affected by the global financial crisis. Our banks were stable and the RBI had pre-emptively tightened policies. Yet, we were the second worst-performing market that year because global capital market flows dried up when India needed them most. Meanwhile, oil prices peaked at $148 per barrel in July 2008, adding pressure with a $140 billion import bill — 14 per cent of GDP — unsustainable for any country.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSince then, India has transformed dramatically, a fact even the government seldom highlights. Our oil dependency has reduced by nearly 60 per cent. Trailing 12 months, India imported 1.7 billion barrels of oil on a $4 trillion economy. Even if oil prices spiked back to $140, the import bill would be about 6 per cent of GDP, much more manageable.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the other side, a silver lining from Covid-19 is the rise of Global Capability Centres (GCCs). With remote work accepted globally, MNC CEOs realised it’s cost-effective to operate from Mumbai instead of Florida, enabling a boom in services exports. GCC exports reached $70 billion last year and are expected to double within 4-5 years. Unlike traditional IT services, which are cyclical and tied to US growth, this trend is secular.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThese changes bring India’s current account deficit down to about 0.5% of GDP — roughly $20 billion — which is minimal in global terms. We have become less dependent on volatile global equity flows and more attractive for stable FDI.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother crucial development since 2015 is India’s migration to flexible inflation targeting. This has resulted in the lowest inflation volatility globally, which reduces interest rate volatility and increases growth volatility, good for stock markets. The discount rate for equities can fall due to lower real rates, making India’s equity valuations attractive.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDomestic investors, who understand these fundamentals better, have increased their equity share in portfolios from 3 per cent in 2015 to around 7.5-8 per cent today, likely to rise further towards 20 per cent, compared to 15 per cent in Europe and 40 per cent in the US. This reflects a genuine structural shift in India’s economy and markets.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis reduced dependence on global capital markets has lowered India’s market beta to 0.4 from 1.3 in 2013, making it a defensive market. In a global bear market, however, India’s low beta should make it a strong performer and highly sought after.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>What could go wrong for India?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMany risks are external and beyond India’s control, which complicates matters. On domestic fronts, corporate and household balance sheets are robust, and significant reforms remain to be imple­mented, representing low-hanging growth fruit waiting to be plucked.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, external challenges loom. The global economy is burdened with record debt and its population is aging, which could trigger crises within the next few years. The geopolitical environment is volatile, with India’s neighbours economically or politically unstable.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tInternally, farm sector reforms remain critical. India has around 200 million farmers, and while reforms were proposed earlier, progress is needed to lift farmers out of poverty. If 400 million non-farmers surge ahead while farmers lag behind, societal challenges could escalate. Indian agriculture spans nearly half the country’s land but productivity is low; matching countries like China could transform this sector into a $2 trillion economy capable of feeding much of the world.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>What’s the outlook for corporate earnings growth?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tCorporate earnings are cyclical. Profits as a share of GDP grew from 2 per cent post-global financial crisis to 5 per cent, followed by a mid-cycle slowdown last year due to government spending contraction around elections. However, recent RBI policy pivots and GST rate cuts set the stage for a strong growth revival.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tI expect corporate earnings to rise from 5 per cent to possibly 7-9 per cent of GDP over the next 4-5 years, implying 15-20 per cent earnings growth aligned with 10-11 per cent nominal GDP growth. Capacity utilisation, currently in the high 70s percentile, should improve, driving capital expenditure.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tPrivate sector capex-to-GDP is now above 31 per cent, approaching, but unlikely to reach, the 39 per cent peak of the previous cycle, partly because productivity improvements reduce the capex intensity needed to sustain growth.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>What’s the outlook for gold and silver?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tI don’t consider gold and silver as asset classes. To me, an asset must generate income. Equities yield dividends, bonds pay coupons, deposits give interest, and real estate earns rent. Gold, silver, and even Bitcoin produce no income, they merely store value. So, they should not be compared to productive assets.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>You spoke about AI and disruption over the next five to seven years. Which sectors, in your view, face the least disruption risk from an investor’s perspective?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe jury is still out on how exactly AI will shape the world. I don’t believe large language models (LLMs) are the main source of disruption. The real disruptive force, in my view, will be embodied AI-robots capable of performing physical tasks. This is still early days, and the picture will evolve over the next 12-24 months.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tI don’t see disruption hitting manufacturing or IT services soon. In fact, India could benefit from the next wave of AI adoption. When AI gets monetised globally, India will likely develop much of the customer-facing and operational software. Many global multinationals are already doing significant AI work from India.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tYes, we don’t manufacture chips, and we aren’t creating our own LLMs, but those are early stages of AI. As the real applications emerge, India will be well positioned to lead. </div></div>",
