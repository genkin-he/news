They submitted end-user certificates required under Beijing’s export control regime, ensuring the materials will not be diverted to the United States (US) or used for defence production.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn his media briefing, Jaiswal also noted that the US has granted India a six-month waiver, effective October 29, from sanctions on the Chabahar port project in Iran, where India has played a central role in development.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn trade negotiations, he said New Delhi remains “engaged with the US on finalising the trade deal”. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met earlier this week on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur, where discussions are believed to have touched on the pending trade deal. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tJaiswal also told reporters India is assessing how Thursday's understanding between Washington and Beijing on rare earths might affect its own interests. These comments came hours after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, where Beijing agreed to delay by a year the introduction of its latest round of rare earth export restrictions, originally slated to take effect on November 8.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe four aforementioned firms granted import licences are key suppliers to the Indian automobile industry, which has been hit hard by China’s curbs on exports of rare earth materials -- essential components in electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, aircraft and weapons systems.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tNew Delhi had raised the issue during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to India in August, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Xi in Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit. China had then promised to resume exports of rare earths and fertilisers, later seeking end-use certification from Indian buyers.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tJaiswal said the government is also examining the implications of recent US sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft. “Our decisions naturally take into account the evolving dynamics of the global market,” he said, adding that India’s energy policy is driven by the need to “secure affordable energy from diverse sources to meet the energy security needs of our 1.4 billion people.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn a related comment, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that India had been “very good” on reducing oil imports from Russia, while noting that China continues to purchase large volumes. Trump said Xi has been “buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China. And, you know, I can say India's been very good on that front.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn the Chabahar port waiver, Jaiswal confirmed that India’s exemption from US sanctions will run for six months. The US had earlier indicated that activities linked to the Iranian port could attract penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act, revoking a waiver granted in 2018. Chabahar forms a key node in the International North–South Transport Corridor connecting India with Central Asia and Europe.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tWith the Quad Summit unlikely to be held this year, Jaiswal said the grouping -- comprising India, Japan, the US, and Australia -- “remains a valuable forum for discussions on shared interests,” adding that any leaders’ summit is arranged “through diplomatic consultations among the four partners.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAmid renewed tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the MEA reiterated India’s support for Kabul. “Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories,” Jaiswal said. “It seems to think it has the right to practise cross-border terrorism with impunity. Its neighbours find it unacceptable. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAddressing cross-border payment challenges — such as prioritising key transaction corridors, meeting compliance requirements in those markets, and developing strong alternatives to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) — will be critical for Indian financial technology (fintech) companies seeking to scale globally, executives said at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit 2025.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe push by Indian fintechs to expand internationally comes amid thin payment margins in the domestic market, where most digital transactions are dominated by the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), India’s real-time payments system.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tExecutives said the confidence to scale payments businesses globally stems from a more mature technology stack among Indian players, with the flexibility to adapt to local rules, data localisation requirements, and compliance norms in each market.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAchieving meaningful scale in cross-border payments, however, will require overcoming challenges around risk, compliance, taxation, speed, and cost, they added. They were speaking with <em>Ajinkya Kawale</em> of <em>Business Standard</em> during a panel discussion titled ‘Post-UPI, Indian Payment Players Look to Foreign Shores’.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Very often, we compare and say there is more money to be made overseas. We’re used to very thin margins thanks to our large population. Anything higher than that [domestic payment margins] seems very appealing to us,” said Arif Khan, chief innovation officer, Razorpay.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe sharper focus on markets such as Southeast Asia, Asia-Pacific, and the US comes at a time when fintechs are targeting profitability while also looking to deepen their global presence.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWith UPI currently merchant discount rate-free in India and its growth supported by government incentives, the platform’s international expansion has gained momentum. There are now more than 450 million UPI users in the country.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In the Indian market, with UPI at almost no cost, monetisation is difficult because there’s still a cost of innovation and compliance. At the same time, everyone needs profitability. So, one looks for opportunities where you can monetise and make money,” said Harsh Gupta, chief revenue officer, Cashfree Payments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, Indian fintechs’ penetration in cross-border transactions remains limited, even as firms enhance services and lower costs for customers.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There are opportunities to reduce costs depending on how a business grows — through better deals with banks, payment partners, and others. Cross-border payments are growing. But in India, less than 5 per cent of these are handled by fintechs — one of the lowest figures globally,” said Sanjay Tripathy, cofounder and chief executive officer, BriskPe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExecutives agreed that stablecoins, despite their global popularity, are unlikely to see large-scale adoption in India soon due to compliance concerns.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Few countries like us have taken such a lead in deploying the central bank digital currency (CBDC) model. The way trade happens through CBDCs, the flows have to align. Stablecoins are becoming popular, but for trade, I don’t see adoption,” said Rahul Jain, chief financial officer, NTT Data Payment Services.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInstead, the presence of CBDCs is expected to enable targeted initiatives such as direct benefit transfers. “CBDCs are more of a tool to reach the poor and Tier-III citizens of our country. But the underlying distributed architecture in a world where everything is centralised — that’s going to be a challenge,” said Khan of Razorpay.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, he added that while SWIFT was “a great solution”, it remained a standard “not set by us” and was expensive. “The banks love it because there’s a passback that comes to them through that system. From a fintech point of view, there’s no passback for us. SWIFT is a big challenge,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGupta noted that the cost of moving funds still varies widely across jurisdictions. “When you think of cross-border payments, the first things that come to mind are risk, compliance, taxation, speed, and cost. Today, the cost of moving funds is inconsistent across countries unless there are well-defined trade agreements and clear regulations,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTripathy added that compliance continues to be a major hurdle across markets. “The primary thing that needs to happen is compliance. Everyone struggles because compliance requirements vary across countries, instruments, and players,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Jain outlined plans to enable UPI payments for Indian travellers in Japan after NTT Data Payment Services signed a memorandum of understanding with NPCI International Payments, the overseas arm of the National Payments Corporation of India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“A lot of new-age apps like PayPay or Docomo Pay — we’re trying to engage them through incentive programmes to boost QR penetration. But when you look at large merchants, integrations there are very different from what we have in India,” he said.</div></div>",

            "id": 125103001259,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tInternationalisation of Indian rupee is not to replace the dollar but to reduce risk for Indian businesses by enabling more transactions in rupees, Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor <strong>T Rabi Sankar</strong> said in a fireside chat with <strong>Tamal Bandopadhyay</strong> during the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit on Thursday. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>The RBI has issued new norms for external commercial borrowing (ECB) and foreign exchange liberalisation -- on foreign currency borrowing by Indian companies -- removing cost caps, widening eligible borrowers and lenders, expanding end users, and raising the borrowing limit to 300 per cent. Why are we opening up so many things so fast?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThese are not short-term measures. If you look at the RBI’s stance on capital account convertibility, we have consistently said that it is a process, not an event. In this spirit, we have been gradually liberalising the capital account. Today, barring a few constraints such as cost caps and amount limits on ECBs, most inward capital flows are liberalised.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhat remains more under control is the extent of outward flows, which aligns with our stage of development. Regarding ECBs, we have taken several steps over the years to simplify processes, such as allowing derivative use and commodity hedging. Trade flows are also being liberalised as part of the effort to make foreign exchange transactions smoother and more convenient.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe current ECB proposals, still in draft form, aim to ensure that only financially strong entities borrow abroad. Instead of cost caps, we now link permissible borrowing to a firm’s leverage. Once this framework is finalised, cost caps and other limits may no longer be necessary. This is not a sudden move; it’s the continuation of a decades-long process of gradual liberalisation. We are still in the discussion stage and will finalise the framework after reviewing feedback, likely in the next couple of months.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>In the backdrop of global uncertainties, what would be the next stage of relaxations in terms of capital account convertibility, since the Indian rupee is only partially convertible on the capital account?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tTrade is largely free, with only procedural requirements such as repatriation timelines. We have already released two draft proposals to simplify trade regulations, reducing over 100 directives to a single comprehensive framework. ECB liberalisation is part of this broader effort. Our priority remains on facilitating inflows of capital first, followed by calibrated outflows.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>We start a policy and want to see results immediately. But many reforms take a long time to bear fruit. How do you see this in the context of internationalisation of the rupee?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tPolicy-making often involves preparing the ground for the future. Digital payments, for instance, took years after the introduction of two-factor authentication to really take off. Similarly, internationalising the rupee is a long-term process. The goal isn’t to replace the dollar, that’s unrealistic, but to reduce risk for Indian businesses by enabling more transactions in rupees. This reduces currency exposure for exporters and contributes to a more balanced global system where multiple currencies play a role. Over time, as India grows into a top global economy, the rupee must become more widely accepted in cross-border trade. We are creating the conditions for that transition, even if adoption takes time.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Despite all the talk, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) hasn’t really taken off. Where is CBDC today, and why should I use it if I already have UPI, which gives me interest on deposits while CBDC does not?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tYou’ve asked two questions — where CBDC is, and why CBDC. Let me take them one by one.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the “where”: CBDC has been progressing as a pilot since 2022. We are not rushing it because most countries are still experimenting and studying its impact. Over 100 million transactions have taken place so far, but we are going slow to understand potential effects; for instance, whether CBDCs could replace bank deposits.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe are technologically ready, but our approach is cautious. We are also testing “programmable” CBDC use cases such as government benefits or education loans that can be spent only on specific items.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the “why”: CBDC enables things that existing systems can’t, notably programmability and cross-border efficiency. Domestic payment systems like UPI work well, but cross-border transfers remain slow and expensive. CBDC can settle such transactions instantly and cheaply, without intermediaries. That’s why we see CBDC as uniquely useful, though the global understanding of token money is still evolving.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is there any change in your approach to cryptocurrency, especially with stablecoins being legalised in some countries?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNo, our stance remains unchanged. Both unbacked cryptocurrencies and stablecoins pose significant risks. Our analysis continues to show that cryptocurrencies do not serve any legitimate purpose that existing forms of money cannot serve better. Unbacked cryptos have no underlying cash flows or issuers, and hence, no intrinsic value.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStablecoins, while backed, pose risks of currency substitution and loss of monetary sovereignty, especially for emerging markets like India. We believe CBDC can meet all legitimate use cases of stablecoins without those risks.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>There’s some confusion in the payments space. For years we’ve had two-factor authentication, but now there’s an alternative authentication framework. Can you explain the new system?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tActually, we may not even have needed a regulation. Two-factor authentication has become synonymous with OTPs (one-time passwords), though technology now allows more secure alternatives. Fraudsters evolve, so authentication methods must evolve too.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe new framework allows flexibility; OTP remains valid but is no longer the only option. The idea is to encourage innovation and better security as technology evolves.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>On foreign exchange reserves, the RBI has churned a substantial portion in recent years, making profits by selling old holdings and buying at higher prices. With the old stock depleting, will your ability to generate profits and pay dividends to the government reduce?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tYes, if earnings change, surplus transfers will also change. But that’s incidental. The central bank doesn’t operate with profit as an objective. Surplus transfers come mainly from seigniorage income, which belongs to the people and is rightly passed on to the government.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs for valuation, we follow standard accounting practices: holdings are recorded at average acquisition cost, and profits or losses are booked against that. So even though the average cost rises over time, it balances out. Depending on exchange rate movements, sales can yield either profit or loss.</div></div>",

Mandating basic catastrophe insurance for homeowners, just like motor insurance, can be a simple yet effective step,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDahiya suggested linking such insurance to essential utilities like electricity or gas connections to ensure universal coverage.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnup Rau, MD&amp;CEO, Generali Central Insurance Company, added that underwriting and claims management must evolve from reactive to preventive frameworks. “We must incentivise customers who take steps to secure their assets or reduce their carbon footprint. This shared responsibility will bring down risk costs over time,” he said, citing a partnership with the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) to promote such behaviour.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNaveen Chandra Jha, MD&amp;CEO, SBI General Insurance, pointed out that climate change is no longer a future concern but a current crisis. “Cyclones that used to occur once in five years are now happening four times a year,” he said, calling for dynamic underwriting practices using satellite imaging, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics. He also highlighted the success of a parametric insurance model piloted with the Nagaland Disaster Management Authority, where payouts are triggered automatically based on climatic parameters like temperature or rainfall.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTurning to cyber insurance, panellists agreed that India faces a mounting challenge as digital transactions soar. Rao warned that while large institutions are often insured, individual consumers remain highly exposed. “People fall prey to phishing or account breaches, but there is no appreciation of the need for cyber cover,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJha said that cyber frauds account for about 0.7 per cent of India’s GDP, with actual losses likely closer to 2 per cent due to underreporting. “With 600 million Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions happening daily, cyber risk has grown exponentially. Insurers are responding with new products that even cover risks like password sharing or social engineering fraud,” he said. Jha added that collaboration with tech firms is crucial as “cybercriminals are always two steps ahead”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the evolving motor insurance landscape, Singhel said EVs bring new challenges, especially related to battery safety and infrastructure. “We are looking at global EV insurance models and customising them for India. Our focus is not only on accident coverage but also on roadside assistance, charging infrastructure, and battery-related risks,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry experts said insurers are keeping pace with the fast-changing EV ecosystem. “EV insurance in India today is quite robust,” one executive said, noting that the segment is evolving in complexity just like automobiles themselves. “The real test will come when self-driving cars arrive — that’s when liability determination will become an entirely new challenge for insurers and courts,” the executive said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDahiya said: “About 5.5 per cent of our motor insurance searches now relate to EVs — a 65 per cent jump over last year. Battery protection products are seeing a 67 per cent attachment rate, showing that consumers are aware and concerned about battery risk.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that third-party losses may actually be lower for EVs because of safer driving behaviour among early adopters.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRau explained that while claim-handling for EVs is not fundamentally different from other vehicles, the future challenge will lie in assigning liability once autonomous driving becomes common. “Ultimately, liability will stay — whether with the manufacturer or the user — and insurers will adapt as patterns emerge,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTalking about goods and services tax (GST) waiver on health insurance, Jha said it has already improved affordability and awareness — two of the three pillars of insurance adoption. “With GST waived, affordability has gone up, and the media coverage around it has created more awareness. Now it’s our turn as insurers to focus on accessibility — reaching Tier-2, Tier-3 cities, and rural India,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRau added that while insurers lose some input tax credit (ITC) benefits, customers are saving nearly 16-18 per cent, which will likely improve retention. “Many customers are realising their renewal premiums are lower than last year’s. That’s a big psychological boost and should reduce policy lapses,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSinghel said that while the GST move is welcome, India must go further to ensure universal health coverage. “Health is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. We still have 40 crore-50 crore Indians uninsured, which costs the economy 1.2 per cent in lost growth each year. If everyone were covered, India’s GDP could be 1.2 per cent higher,” he said.</div></div>",

The day kicked off with a fireside chat with Ajay Seth, chairman of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), who assured stakeholders that as a regulator he has an open mind.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t“As a regulator, this being my first appearance, I would like to assure that I have an open mind. Based on data, analysis, and the perspectives I hear, I reach a conclusion. But nothing is done without extensive consultation, generating discussion, and building consensus,” said Seth. His comments would be reassuring for an industry battling muted growth in new policies and premium income.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t“The insurance sector, and especially the health insurance sector, is at an unstable equilibrium at the moment. On the life side, there is a low-efficiency equilibrium happening. But other sectors that manage the savings pools of Indians are giving tough competition to life insurance companies,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tOn the question of more capital for the insurance industry, he said that allowing 100 per cent FDI alone cannot meet the sector’s capital needs. “The own capital of the  insurance industry is about ₹3.5 trillion, both life and non-life put together. Out of this, FDI is only ₹80,000-90,000 crore.”</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe government’s plan to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) of up to 100 per cent in the insurance sector could also pave the way for global pension fund managers to enter the market without joint venture partners, as the FDI norms under insurance and pension laws are “joined at the hip”, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Chairperson S Ramann indicated in a fireside chat. Currently, FDI is permitted up to 74 per cent in the pension fund management space.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tStressing the need to enhance pension coverage in the country, Ramann also said the regulator is considering allowing smaller pension fund houses, on the lines of small finance banks regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. Such funds, with lower capital requirements, could offer products for underserved sections of the population in tier-III cities, MSME clusters, and rural communities that may not have any social security cover.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn all, there were 15 sessions on the second day of the summit, with top executives from life insurance, general insurance, private equity, the payments industry, wealth management, and the microfinance industry presenting the way forward for their sectors.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tReserve Bank of India Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said that internationalisation of the Indian rupee is not intended to replace the dollar but to reduce risk for Indian businesses by enabling more transactions in rupees. “If you look at the Reserve Bank’s stance on capital account convertibility, we have fairly consistently been saying that it is a process, not an event. In this spirit, we have gradually been liberalising the capital account. Today, barring a few constraints like cost caps and amount limits on ECBs (external commercial borrowings), most inward capital flows are liberalised,” he said.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/companies/quarterly-results/itc-q2-results-net-profit-rises-2-7-to-5-126-11-cr-revenue-down-1-3-125103001412_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">ITC Q2 results: Net profit rises 2.7% to ₹5,126.11 cr, revenue down 1.3%</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAccording to Sankar, the regulator is currently focused on liberalising inward capital flows given the country’s need for capital at its current stage of development, but as the Indian economy matures, it will look at outward capital flows.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\t“Trade is largely free, with only procedural requirements such as repatriation timelines. We have already released two draft proposals to simplify trade regulations, reducing over 100 directives to a single comprehensive framework. ECB liberalisation is part of this broader effort. Our priority remains on facilitating inflows of capital first, followed by calibrated outflows,” he said.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe RBI deputy governor also deliberated on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and politely brushed off suggestions that it had failed to take off. “We are not rushing it because most countries are still experimenting and studying its impact. Over 10 crore transactions have taken place, but we are going slow to understand potential effects -- for instance, whether CBDCs could replace bank deposits. We are technologically ready, but our approach is cautious,” he remarked.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tTop executives in the wealth management industry said that India’s growing economy is a major tailwind for them. The industry is entering a defining phase as a swelling pool of high-net-worth (HNI) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNI) fuels demand for sophisticated financial advice and innovative investment products.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIndia’s millionaire households have nearly doubled since 2021, with smaller towns and cities contributing significantly to the growth. This surge, driven by economic expansion and a shift towards financialisation, is transforming the wealth management landscape, making services more accessible and technology-driven, most panellists echoed.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tExecutives from the microfinance industry (MFI) said the worst is behind them after recent quarters marked by liquidity stress, rising delinquencies, and slowing disbursements. “Now the situation is better. We have requested the government to institute a larger guarantee fund of, say, ₹ 20,000 crore, which will kick-start the virtuous cycle of funding and give confidence to banks,” said Alok Misra, CEO of the Microfinance Industry Network (MFIN).<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAnother high point of the penultimate day was a fireside chat with Arundhati Bhattacharya, former banker and now chairperson and CEO of Salesforce India, and one of the country’s top women business leaders. “If you’re a woman in India with a career, you have to continuously calibrate how to take care of family responsibilities while taking on newer responsibilities at work. There will be times when you feel it’s not worth it, but you need to accept that this is how it will be and find a way to still get ahead,” she said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tExecutives from the payments industry assured that Indian financial sector customers are relatively safer thanks to the Reserve Bank of India’s stringent requirements from the industry, even as they await implementation of the data privacy Bill.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tDeep Narayan Mukherjee, partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), said: “Data breach is one aspect of a cyberattack; the other is ransomware, which is not related to your customer. There are more and more instances globally in the last two or three months where non-customer-centric organisations’ businesses have been hacked.” He was speaking at a session on 'Trust No One, Verify Everything: Cybersecurity for the Digital Age'.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAt the general insurance panel discussion, the chiefs of general insurance companies highlighted that, with a surge in climate-related disasters, cyber threats, and emerging workplace models, there needs to be stronger collaboration between insurers, government, and technology partners to address these “new-age risks”. They also said there is a need to build comprehensive frameworks to protect people and businesses against digital fraud, climate catastrophes, and the risks associated with electric vehicles and the gig economy.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAt the life insurance panel discussion, the chiefs of life insurers said that the recent GST reforms will make insurance more affordable and inclusive in India. The GST exemption in insurance will help reduce premiums, enhance affordability, and signal the government’s strong focus on insurance as an essential life necessity.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tCrypto industry leaders and policymakers urged the government to introduce clear regulations for digital assets, warning that prolonged uncertainty is driving innovation and talent overseas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn a panel titled India’s Crypto Crossroads: Time for a Policy Rethink?, Dilip Chenoy (Bharat Web3 Association), Sumit Gupta (CoinDCX), G Padmanabhan (former executive director, RBI), and S B Sekar (head of APAC, Binance) said India risks missing a $1.1 trillion opportunity by delaying policy action. They also called for an INR-backed stablecoin to reduce remittance costs and strengthen India’s monetary sovereignty.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tPadmanabhan cautioned that with 97 per cent of stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, India must act to avoid dollar dominance. Gupta added that “the best time to regulate was yesterday; the next best is today.” While panellists were divided on creating a separate regulator, they agreed that India must move fast on principle-based, flexible rules that balance innovation and oversight. Without clarity, they warned, India’s Web3 and blockchain talent will continue to leave for friendlier markets, eroding its leadership in digital finance.</div></div>",

The regulator is also considering an idea to permit smaller pension fund houses, on the lines of small finance banks regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>How do we scale up India’s pension coverage?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe National Pension System (NPS) has delivered an average annual return of 9.2 per cent over 15 years, but participation remains skewed. About 75 per cent of total NPS assets are from government subscribers and 25 per cent from others. We perhaps need to reverse that. The goal should be to raise non-government NPS members from 10 million to 250–300 million in the next five to six years using various digital platforms. We need more funds as well, particularly to reach out to Tier-II and Tier-III cities.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have large co-operatives, areas where there is greater wealth, micro, small, and medium enterprise clusters, and lots of workers. We never know where that demand comes from, and we need not just stick to the existing structure of a pension fund that requires ₹50 crore of capital. Can we not look at having a small pension fund, if I could take a leaf out of small finance banks?<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe need to leverage the fact that we’ve got the best payment system in the world. So why are we not able to bring in more people as distributors who are probably not regulated entities as we demand today? We just need to ensure we are testing for the data flow and ensuring there are no leaks anywhere.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Even before the Association of Mutual Funds in India launched the popular ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ campaign, PFRDA had launched the ‘NPS Zaroori Hai’ campaign. Is there something in the works to spread the pension message further?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis issue cuts across financial products. Financial literacy is the bedrock for a lot of buying of financial products, and we still need to get that literacy going in vast numbers in a lot of regions. We are so urban-focused today that we’ve forgotten what it is to be able to do a small business in a reasonably small town. I can assure you there is such a high aspiration among those people to grow their wealth and get their children better educated. We need to have financial planners cutting across the sort of turf between mutual funds (MFs), insurance, and pensions, and have the large number of persons who are already there as a distribution workforce ensure we have a minimum certification programme for each product and make that into a viable business. We really have to look at literacy going down to the grassroots. The regulators should be putting their effort behind this entire literacy campaign to reach the right audience with the right content.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The multiplicity of pension products under different regulatory domains is an issue. The insurance industry offers ‘retirement’ products, including annuities. A few MF schemes are called retirement benefit plans. There is, of course, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Is there a need for some cohesion in the way these products are regulated, maybe through a dialogue with other regulators?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThat dialogue is actually happening. There is a regulatory forum for pensions, which has already been instituted. But I think the larger issue is that we have had financial products emerge over the past 150 years, and each one has come in for a particular purpose and has served that purpose very well. I would say that given the need for all these products, we need to have a simple definition which everybody adheres to. So, in order to reduce the possibility of mis-selling, what does a pension product mean? According to us, it is at least 15 years of being invested in a particular product and saving towards that.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have something called a reasonable corpus that builds up with the power of compounding, but at the end of that, today, the law says that you have to forcibly put it into an annuity. Now, an annuity is a very good product, but given the fact that it has to deal with the uncertainty of life, anyone who has designed that product will ensure that there is enough capital buffer and a solvency ratio to ensure that you are in a position to meet the longevity risk as and when it happens. So we have to provide alternatives in terms of the pension payout product. That is why PFRDA has issued a consultation paper looking at the possibility of whether we can add something further with annuity. I think the job really is for the regulator to put across a set of products, and finally, it is for each customer to choose what is suitable for them.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The late finance minister Arun Jaitley had alluded to an idea in one of his Budget speeches that an Indian employee should have a choice between the EPFO and the NPS. Could this new forum examine this?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe EPF is a provident fund which has an accumulation stage. A pension has both an accumulation and a payout stage. The EPF is there for good reason, because there was nothing else in this country. The pension sliver started in 1995. Unfortunately, it was targeted to everybody and not just those below the threshold of income for EPF coverage. So, going forward, as part of the regulators’ forum, we are talking about how these pension products could come under a single regulatory umbrella.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEPF and Public Provident Fund are in a particular genre and we should let them remain. It is for the customers, given their tax profile, to assess which products they should put their money in. The return on the EPF corpus may be a tad below what the NPS has got, but it’s also a very good rate of return. So we should have competing products. And that level of competition really is what we should be looking forward to.</div></div>",

At the heart of it stood Jemimah Rodrigues, who played the innings of her life — a breathtaking, unbeaten 127 off 134 balls that turned dreams into destiny on Thursday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen the pressure was at its peak and the shadows of Australia’s dominance loomed large, Rodrigues’ composure and poise stood out. Her masterful innings, supported by captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s authoritative 89 off 88 balls, ensured India not only chased down the mammoth target but did so with nine balls to spare.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/icc-women-s-world-cup-2025-final-schedule-teams-venue-live-streaming-125102901554_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">ICC Women's World Cup 2025 final schedule, teams, venue, live streaming</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> With the win over Australia, India have qualified for the Women’s ODI World Cup final for the third time; they finished runners up in 2005 and 2017.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why this story matters</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Historic chase:</strong> India’s successful pursuit of 339 is the highest-ever chase in women’s One-Day Internationals, rewriting the record books.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis was the first time a 300-plus total was chased down in an ODI World Cup knockout - Men’s or Women’s.

It was a daunting total, built on dominance — but India had other plans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Rodrigues rises as India’s new hero</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia’s pursuit of the record target began cautiously. Shafali Verma opened with intent, cracking Kim Garth through the covers for a crisp boundary in the second over, but her stay was short-lived as she was trapped leg before off the very next ball.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSmriti Mandhana, the leading run-scorer of the tournament before the semifinals, too fell early — edging a leg-side delivery to the wicketkeeper for 24. That left India wobbling at 59 for two, with Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur tasked with rebuilding the innings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe pair steadied the ship with composure and precision. Rodrigues was the more enterprising of the two, reaching her half-century in 57 balls with a boundary off Alana King in the 21st over. Kaur, who had scored 70 against England earlier in the tournament, adopted a more measured approach, bringing up her 22nd ODI fifty off 65 deliveries as India reached 189 for two after 30 overs — still 150 short of the target.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe tension lifted when wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy dropped Rodrigues off King, a miss that proved costly. On the very next delivery, Kaur cut King past point to raise the 150-run stand, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAustralia fought back briefly, with King and Sutherland tightening the screws. Kaur’s dismissal — a lofted shot brilliantly caught by Ashleigh Gardner off Sutherland — broke the partnership at 226 in the 36th over.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDeepti Sharma’s brisk 24 kept the momentum alive before she was run out with nine overs remaining. Rodrigues, meanwhile, powered ahead, completing her third ODI century off 115 balls — a masterclass laced with ten fours. She enjoyed a slice of fortune on 106 when Tahlia McGrath dropped a straightforward catch, but by then, India had seized full control.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRicha Ghosh’s cameo of 26 from 16 deliveries further eased the chase, though her late dismissal added a brief flicker of tension. With 29 needed off the last four overs, Rodrigues remained unflappable, threading three more boundaries in quick succession. Amanjot Kaur, calm at the other end, struck the winning runs with nine balls to spare, sealing one of India’s most memorable victories in women’s cricket history.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The winning moment</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen Amanjot Kaur pierced the field with the winning shot, the floodgates of emotion burst open.
