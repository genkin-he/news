The brokerage noted that over the past decade, the company has built a sustainable moat through full-spectrum capabilities across multiple dosage forms and a track record of successful speciality projects. Additionally, the company has developed robust manufacturing capacities, maintained a consistent compliance record in supplying to US markets, and focused on commercial success.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tConsidering a strong earnings CAGR of 43 per cent over FY25-28 and over 30 per cent RoE (adjusted for recent fresh issue), analysts at MOFSL believe Rubicon should command a premium valuation. \"Rubicon scores well ahead of peers in pharma space on ROE*earnings CAGR matrix,\" the brokerage said. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL values Rubicon Research at a 35x multiple (30 per cent premium to the sector multiple of 27x) on 12-month forward earnings, arriving at a target price of ₹740. The target implies a 21 per cent upside from Friday's closing price of ₹609.8. </div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\tAt 10:45 AM on Friday, the Rubicon Research stock was trading at ₹624, up over 2.3 per cent compared to the previous session's close of ₹609.8 on the NSE. The recently listed company's total market capitalisation stood at ₹10,232 crore.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHere's why Motilal Oswal holds a positive outlook on Rubicon Research:</h3>\n<h3>\r\n\tRubicon scales despite US generics headwinds </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL noted that despite challenges in the US generics market, including consolidation of buyers, faster ANDA approvals, increasing competition, and rising adverse inspection outcomes, Rubicon has scaled its business significantly, growing revenue from ₹390 million in FY15 to ₹12.8 billion in FY25, supported by focused R&amp;D, streamlined manufacturing, and strong compliance.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tScaled up portfolio with faster launches</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage further highlighted that Rubicon has rapidly expanded its commercial product portfolio from 18 in FY22 to 70 by June 2025, achieving an 86.4 per cent conversion rate from approvals to launches in Q1FY26. The company’s offerings span oral solids, oral liquids, nasal sprays, and topicals, with oral solids revenue growing at a 57 per cent CAGR to ₹11 billion over FY22–25, and oral liquids scaling from ₹43 million to ₹1.3 billion. In Q1FY26, OS/OL revenue rose 7 per cent/25 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹3 billion/₹355 million, while nasal spray revenue reached ₹124 million/₹80 million in FY25/Q1FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, Rubicon’s ₹2.8 billion R&amp;D spend over FY24–Q1FY26 supports ongoing product filings, including six ANDAs filed and six approvals in Q1FY26, underpinning strong revenue visibility through FY25–28.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNasal sprays are emerging as a key growth driver for Rubicon, contributing 2.3 per cent of revenue in Q1FY26, supported by its Ambernath facility. The US nasal spray market is set to grow at a 9.5 per cent CAGR through 2030, and Rubicon stands out with four of the 25 approvals granted between CY23 and June 2025.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRubicon’s CNS playbook</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to MOFSL, Rubicon is expanding its CNS business with three branded products - Equetro, Raldesy, and Lopressor OS—that have no AB-rated generic competitors as of July 2025. Equetro is FDA-approved for bipolar I disorder, Raldesy offers a novel oral liquid formulation of Trazodone for depression, and Lopressor OS provides flexible dosing for heart conditions. Increased focus on marketing to drive better business prospects in this segment for Rubicon.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tEnhanced focus on R&amp;D</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tRubicon’s R&amp;D spending stands at 11 per cent of revenue, significantly higher than the industry median of 6 per cent, highlighting its strategy to develop a broad product portfolio. The company also shows strong efficiency, generating one of the highest R&amp;D turnovers among peers, with US revenues from R&amp;D investments made two years ago. \"With FY25 US revenue nearly 6x its FY22-23 R&amp;D expenditure, Rubicon’s disciplined product selection and development approach is delivering solid results,\" MOFSL said.</div></div>",

Could you please refund me the $50K?\" </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAltman added, \"I really was excited for the car! And I understand delays.

He described it as \"the cherry on the icing of the cake\", adding that Tesla’s main focus is on products with a broader impact on sustainable energy.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMusk said the Roadster’s design was nearing completion and promised it would be \"something spectacular\", indicating that production was planned for 2025. However, he did not confirm any timeline at the time.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tCustomers may receive Roadsters by 2027</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Road &amp; Track, earlier this year, Musk promised \"the most epic demo ever\" in late 2025, which was widely believed to feature the Roadster. On the Ride the Lightning podcast this month, Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen confirmed that the company still aims to stage the demo within the given timeframe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked how long customers might have to wait after the demo to receive their cars, von Holzhausen said if everything goes according to plan, the new Tesla Roadster could hit the roads by the end of 2027.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tAltman-Musk tensions flare again</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAltman’s decision to cancel his Roadster order comes at a time when his feud with Musk is growing. Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015 but left the company in 2018, has often criticised both OpenAI and Altman, saying they have moved away from the group’s original goal of keeping research open to everyone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn recent months, the two have exchanged several sharp remarks. Musk has also filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI. According to Bloomberg, Musk’s lawyer recently said they plan to continue the legal fight, criticising officials in California and Delaware for not stopping OpenAI’s shift into a for-profit company.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

The lineup remains the company’s biggest moneymaker, accounting for roughly half of its revenue. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/industry/news/apple-india-all-time-revenue-record-september-quarter-2025-125103100266_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple India hits record revenue in September quarter on strong iPhone sales</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tApple shares gained more than 4 per cent in late trading. They had been up 8.4 per cent this year through the close.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 27, sales rose 7.9 per cent to $102.5 billion. That slightly beat the $102.2 billion average estimate. Earnings rose to $1.85 a share, topping the average estimate of $1.77.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Cupertino, California-based company benefited from stronger-than-expected services growth in the period, helping offset a slowdown in China. The Mac and wearables division also performed better than anticipated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTariffs added $1.1 billion in expenses during the quarter, in line with Apple’s expectations. The company expects $1.4 billion in tariff costs in the December period. Operating expenses will range from $18.1 billion to $18.5 billion. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRevenue from greater China fell 3.6 per cent to $14.5 billion last quarter, well short of the $16.4 billion that analysts projected. The company faces mounting competition from local smartphone providers and has struggled to offer artificial intelligence features in the country. Still, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said he believes Apple will return to growth in the region during the current quarter. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRevenue from the iPhone gained 6.1 per cent to $49 billion in the September period, helped by the new models. Still, that was just short of the $49.3 billion that analysts projected. Apple said it faced supply constraints, which may have limited growth. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe quarter included roughly two weeks of iPhone 17 availability, and initial demand appeared strong — with sellouts reported across Apple retail stores and third-party channels. Most buyers opted for higher-end iPhone 17 Pro models, helping boost Apple’s average selling price. The $999 iPhone Air — more expensive than the model it replaced — also helped on this front.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tServices remained Apple’s fastest-growing segment last quarter, with revenue rising 15 per cent to $28.8 billion. Analysts had anticipated $28.2 billion.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tDespite the healthy growth, the services business continues to face challenges from regulators seeking to change App Store policies, which could affect software and subscription revenue. However, Apple secured a recent legal victory when a judge declined to dismantle its $20 billion-a-year search deal with Alphabet Inc.’s Google.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tMac revenue increased 13 per cent to $8.73 billion, topping the $8.6 billion average projection. The company refreshed its MacBook Air and Mac Studio lines in March and released a new entry-level MacBook Pro earlier this month.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tThe iPad business, meanwhile, introduced new low-end and Air models in March and updated a Pro version this month. It generated $6.95 billion in revenue, flat from a year earlier. </div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tSales at the wearables, home and accessories division, which includes AirPods, smartwatches, TV set-top boxes and the HomePod smart speaker, declined less than 1 per cent to $9.01 billion. Analysts had feared a steeper drop in the period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tOnce viewed as a key growth driver, the wearables division peaked in 2021 with nearly $15 billion in holiday-quarter revenue. Newer products like the Vision Pro headset, recently updated with a faster chip, have struggled to gain traction.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tStill, Apple could see renewed interest in the coming years with the introduction of smart glasses and a wave of new smart home devices.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The Trump administration said it's necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the programme into a tool of political retribution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSet to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organisations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or chemical castration of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organisations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChemical castration is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt amounts to a major reworking of a programme that has cancelled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe programme \"was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service not to subsidise organisations that violate the law, whether by harbouring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex, Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new rules are weaponising loan forgiveness to make it harder for groups that work on issues like refugee and transgender rights, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Centre for Immigrant Rights.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLukens said many of the attorneys, social workers and paralegals who work at his organisation on deportation defence and other immigration litigation count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAll of a sudden, that's going away, Lukens said. The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn't, we're going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe programme promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits' tax status and their field of work.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe benefit has gone to workers at organisations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has misdirected tax dollars into activist organisations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organisation's work should be considered to have a substantial illegal purpose.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEmployers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the programme if a state or federal court rules against them, or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. Performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, appears to be grounds for expulsion.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEven without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organisation should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the preponderance of the evidence leans against the employer.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe department dismissed concerns from many who said that bar is too low.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers, federal officials wrote.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, simply because those attorneys' jobs were deemed politically unfavourable by the Secretary.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules based on their own priorities or ideology.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRep Tim Walberg, chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at radical organisations that violate state and federal laws.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. Those barred from the programme can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a corrective action plan approved by the secretary.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDocuments from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances. Not all organisations that break the law have a substantial illegal purpose, the agency said, and it ultimately comes down to the secretary's analysis of the evidence.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",
