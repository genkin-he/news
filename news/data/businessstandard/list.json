Director, President and Representative Toshihiro Mibe said the automaker is finalising strategies for the Indian market amid changes in the global markets with the emergence of Chinese OEMs.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<p>\r\n\tEven Honda is impacted by this trend and in this kind of situation the company considers North America, Japan, and India as its growth markets.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"India is going to be a priority market, and that's the market where we want to spend more effort going forward. Within Honda, we've initiated a project team, especially for the Indian market, and the project team is working on coming up with the strategy for the Indian market now,\" Mibe said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance, just like Honda's two-wheelers are performing well in the Indian market with a collaborative approach with the Indian suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), there could be similar partnerships for the cars business to maximise its localisation in the country, he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tElaborating further on the plans, Honda Cars India President and CEO Takashi Nakajima said the company has aggressive product plans for the country.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We are planning to launch ten more models in India till 2030. With SUVs becoming mainstream, seven out of the ten models would be catering to that segment,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNakajima announced that it is also gearing up to re-enter the sub 4-meter SUV segment, which is one of the largest verticals volume wise in the overall PV market.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We are considering a wider range of options, products catering to enhance sales volume as well as premium products as well,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese carmaker, currently sells just one SUV model -- Elevate -- in the market with the other two products being Amaze and City sedans.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda plans to produce its next-generation EV Honda 0 Alpha in India and later also utilise the country to export to Japan and some other Asian countries. The model is expected to go on sale in India and Japan in 2027.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe automaker confirmed that it would also consolidate hybrid product range in India. Currently only City sedan has variants featuring the hybrid technology.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe company will have products with multiple powertrains including ICE, hybrid and full electric to cater to varied set of customer requirements in India, it stated.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen asked about market share aspirations, Nakajima said that efforts to streamline the model range in the country has impacted the company's volume and now the focus would be to make Honda stronger in the Indian market.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India has seen its market share dip considerably over the last few years amidst enhanced competition.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAbout expanding production capacity at Tapukara plant in Rajasthan and also possibility of utilising the Greater Noida plant, he noted that nothing is finalised as yet but the automaker is considering various \"options flexibly\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2023, Honda Cars India formally announced closure of manufacturing operations at its Greater Noida facility in Uttar Pradesh.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe automaker said the decision to cease production at the plant, which came up in 1997, has been taken as part of realignment of manufacturing operations with the goal of improving business efficiency.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWith the closure of the Greater Noida facility, HCIL also discontinued CR-V and Civic models in the country. Both the models were being manufactured at the plant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Greater Noida plant had an installed production capacity of one lakh units per annum. On the other hand, Tapukara facility can roll out 1.8 lakh units per year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tReplying to a query on the deployment of flex fuel technologies in its product range, Mibe said Honda has been offering flex fuel vehicles in the Brazilian market for many years and if required can introduce it in India as well.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India registered a cumulative growth of 20 per cent in its total sales with 1,31,871 units sold during calendar year 2024.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDomestic sales of the company stood at 68,650 units and exports at 63,221 units last year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe maker of City and Amaze sedans and Elevate midsize SUV sold a total of 1,10,143 units in 2023 with domestic volume of 84,289 units.</p><p></p></div>",

Through shadow fleets, third-country intermediaries, and non-dollar trades, Russia is likely to maintain 80–90 per cent of its export volumes, mitigating impacts on Rosneft (3.5 million bpd, 40 per cent of Russia's production) and Lukoil (0.9 million bpd, 10 per cent share).<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile sanctions have reduced revenues by over 20 per cent to $297 billion in 2024 and exports by 20 per cent since 2022, they fail to cripple the sector due to Europe's dependency, Russia's adaptability, and enforcement gaps, keeping oil under pressure. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tLatest sanction impact</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRosneft and Lukoil are blocked from US financial systems, complicating dollar trades and shipping, potentially disrupting 1–1.5 million bpd short-term. This could shift the market from a 0.5 million bpd surplus to a deficit by 2026, with a 1 million bpd swing roughly pushing prices $6–$7/bbl higher.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tIndia and China avoid russian oil</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia and China, absorbing 3.7 million bpd (25 per cent of Russia's exports), face challenges, with Indian refiners pausing shipments and China suspending new seaborne purchases, redirecting to Middle East/US sources. India's state refiners cut Russian buys by 45 per cent in Q3, maintaining volumes at 1.7 mb/d (34 per cent share).</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tUS &amp; OPEC+ keeping market in surplus</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tUS output hit a record 13.642 million bpd in the week ending October 24, 2025, up 0.1 per cent w-o-w and 5.4 per cent y-o-y, with the Permian Basin at 6.6 million bpd (48 per cent of US total). EIA forecasts 13.53 million bpd for 2025 (+2 per cent y-o-y) and 13.51 million bpd in 2026, leading non-OPEC growth of 1.6 million bpd in 2025 and 1.2 million bpd in 2026, outpacing demand at 740,000 bpd. OPEC+ is expected to add 137,000 bpd from December, bringing total restoration to 2.85 million bpd from April onward. a negative development for long term price outlook.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMacro development</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US-China trade agreement is a tactical pause, extending the 90-day truce beyond November 10 without resolving core issues like intellectual property, technology transfers, and structural reforms. While the US suspended broader software export curbs on laptops and jet engines, reducing tariffs to 47 per cent on Chinese goods and 30 per cent on US imports, this limited scope focusing on temporary measures like fentanyl cooperation and supply chain adjustments underscores ongoing economic competition, with both sides retaining leverage for future talks. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tOutlook</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tGlobal crude oil supplies are poised for a deepening glut, with prices likely to decline toward $50 per barrel by mid-2026 amid sluggish demand growth and robust production.

Between January and June 2025, over 200,000 spyware attacks were blocked by Kaspersky’s enterprise security solutions, marking a 273 per cent increase compared with the same period last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAccording to the global cybersecurity firm, the surge in targeted spyware campaigns reflects a growing focus on India’s corporate sector, which houses a massive trove of sensitive business and financial data.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Spyware is increasingly targeting corporate India because that’s where the data goldmine lies — sensitive deals, financial flows, and intellectual property,” said Jaydeep Singh, General Manager for India at Kaspersky. “India today is home to global multinationals, a flourishing startup scene, and a booming fintech sector. This mix creates a treasure trove of data that attackers want to capture — for profit, surveillance, or competitive advantage.”</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What spyware does and why it’s dangerous</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSpyware is a stealth software program that secretly installs itself on a user’s device to collect confidential information without consent. Unlike typical malware, spyware does not usually damage the operating system but instead monitors and records user activity — including keystrokes, screen captures, browsing habits, and login credentials.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSuch attacks can compromise passwords, PINs, account details, and personal communications, leading to major privacy breaches and corporate espionage.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Commercial spyware: a growing global threat</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tKaspersky’s report also flagged the rise of commercial spyware, a form of “legal malware” sold to governments and law enforcement agencies but increasingly misused against private organisations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThese sophisticated tools can intercept messages, track locations, eavesdrop on calls, and erase traces of their presence — often through zero-click vulnerabilities, meaning users don’t have to click on any links or attachments to get infected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India’s spyware exposure widens</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe report showed that spyware incidents against Indian businesses rose from 58,578 in H1 2024 to 2,18,479 in H1 2025, underscoring how cybercriminals are scaling their operations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The fact that spyware campaigns exploit both cutting-edge and older unpatched systems shows how persistent these actors are,” Singh added. “This is where threat intelligence becomes essential — helping organisations understand which spyware tools are active, how they operate, and where defences should be strengthened.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Strengthening enterprise defences</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSecurity analysts note that the sharp rise in spyware incidents calls for proactive cybersecurity investments, especially in sectors handling sensitive data like finance, healthcare, and technology.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tExperts recommend stronger endpoint protection, employee awareness programmes, real-time monitoring, and zero-trust architecture to mitigate such attacks.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
