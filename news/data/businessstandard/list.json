Despite affecting millions, misinformation about causes, symptoms, and treatment continues to circulate online and offline. From weight gain worries to misguided supplement use, doctors say that myths often delay diagnosis and proper care.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis <em>Fact-check Friday</em>, we separate medical fact from fiction with insights from Dr Jatin Kumar Majhi, Consultant – Diabetology and Endocrinology, Manipal Hospital, Bhubaneswar.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can only women get thyroid problems?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Only women get thyroid problems</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to Dr Majhi, it is true that <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/content/press-releases-ani/understanding-thyroid-health-and-its-effects-on-weight-123091800681_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">thyroid disorders</a> are more common in women, but men are not immune. He explains that in men, subtle symptoms like low energy or mood changes are often missed, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does thyroid disease always cause weight gain?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease always causes weight gain</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Not always. While hypothyroidism (a sluggish thyroid) can slow metabolism and add a few kilos, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) can cause weight loss. In reality, most thyroid issues do not drastically change weight, and any gain can be managed with proper treatment, diet, and movement.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div class=\"wrap-iframe\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqztK_L5hf0\" title=\"Thyroid facts vs myths: What really affects your hormones\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can you stop thyroid medication once you feel better?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You can stop thyroid medication once you feel better</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Dr Majhi calls this a dangerous assumption. Thyroid medication controls the condition and not cure it. Stopping treatment abruptly can make symptoms worse or cause a hormonal crash. Always speak to your doctor before changing or stopping any thyroid therapy, he advised.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will iodine supplements cure thyroid problems?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Taking iodine supplements cures thyroid problems</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to Dr Majhi, most people already get enough iodine through their diet and <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/salt-myths-fact-check-daily-sodium-health-risks-125100300020_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">iodised salt</a>. He cautions that too much iodine can actually worsen conditions like Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. Supplements are not a cure and can backfire.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do all thyroid nodules mean cancer?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>All thyroid nodules mean <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/women-cancer-detection-gap-lancet-study-125102300345_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">cancer</a></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Over 90 per cent of thyroid nodules are non-cancerous. Still, every lump deserves attention. The right approach is to get it checked soon. Early detection ensures peace of mind and, if needed, early treatment.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does thyroid disease always show visible swelling?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease always shows visible swelling or a neck bulge</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>The thyroid does not always make itself known. Many thyroid disorders are “silent”, with vague signs like fatigue, dry skin, or irregular periods. Blood tests and scans are the only reliable ways to confirm what’s going on under the skin.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can herbal supplements replace thyroid medication?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Natural or herbal supplements can replace thyroid medication</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>“No herbal remedy or “detox” has been scientifically proven to replace prescribed thyroid hormones. In fact, some supplements can interfere with medication or even cause side effects if taken unsupervised,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can thyroid disease make pregnancy impossible?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease makes pregnancy impossible</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Dr Majhi says that most women with thyroid disorders can conceive and have healthy pregnancies, provided they are properly treated and monitored. The key is regular hormone checks and medical supervision.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Is it impossible to lose weight with hypothyroidism?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You can’t lose weight if you have hypothyroidism</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Weight loss might be slower, but it is possible. Once thyroid levels are stabilised, a balanced diet, protein intake, and regular exercise work as effectively as they do for anyone else. “Blaming every stubborn kilo on the thyroid is an easy trap,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Are thyroid disorders rare in India?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disorders are rare</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>India is one of the global hotspots for thyroid disease. Recent data suggest that self-reported thyroid disorders among Indians aged 15–49 years rose to 2.9 per cent in 2019–21 (National Family Health Survey-V). Other smaller studies suggest a broader prevalence of 10–12 per cent or higher in adult populations. However, deficits in national biomarker surveys mean the true figure may be higher. Because symptoms often mimic other issues, millions remain undiagnosed, silently dealing with fatigue and mood swings they can’t explain.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will cutting out gluten cure thyroid disease?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Cutting out gluten will cure thyroid disease</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Unless you have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet helps thyroid health. It can help some autoimmune thyroid patients, but for most, it’s unnecessary and nutritionally restrictive.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does a normal TSH mean your thyroid is fine?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>If your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, your thyroid is perfectly fine</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/health-checks-for-mothers-over-40-tests-to-preventive-care-guide-125060900286_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">TSH</a> is just one piece of the puzzle. Dr Majhi says that for a full picture, doctors also look at Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibodies. A normal TSH does not always mean everything is in balance, especially if you are still feeling off.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do thyroid medicines make you dependent?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Once you start medication, you will become dependent</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to the doctors, medicines like Levothyroxine aren’t addictive and simply replace what your body can’t make. It doesn’t fix the root cause, but it keeps your metabolism and hormones stable.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can apple cider vinegar or turmeric cure thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Home remedies like apple cider vinegar or turmeric can fix thyroid issues</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>While these may support general wellness, they can’t balance thyroid hormones. They might help digestion or inflammation, but they’re no match for medical therapy. Use them as lifestyle support, not substitutes.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Should you avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You must avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Quite the opposite! Dr Majhi says exercise actually helps stabilise metabolism, improve mood, and manage weight. Unless your thyroid levels are severely uncontrolled, movement is medicine. Just tailor the intensity under your doctor’s guidance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Majhi stresses that thyroid disorders are common, treatable, and misunderstood. What makes them tricky is how they usually mimic everyday fatigue or stress. That is why periodic screening and trusted medical advice matter more than social media “cures.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The thyroid gland may be small, but its impact on overall health is enormous. Understanding the facts and not falling for myths is the first step towards control,” he says.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div></div><div><blockquote class=\"blockquoteBG styleQ1\" style=\"background-color:#FFF5EB;padding:8px;overflow:hidden\">\n<p>\n<strong>About Fact-Check Friday</strong></p>\n<p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tMisinformation in health can be more harmful than the illness itself.

But we can join together for the ultimate goal of shared prosperity,\" Lee said. I hope we will have candid and constructive discussions on how we can achieve Apec's vision in the face of the new challenge of a rapidly changing international economic environment.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tTrump left South Korea after his meeting with the Chinese president, and international media spotlight is now on Xi, whose government has portrayed itself as a defender of free trade and an alternative to US protectionism.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's Xi's first visit to South Korea in 11 years, and he's scheduled to meet Lee and new Japanese Prime Minister new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi separately on Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDespite Trump's optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the countries, with both seeking dominant places in manufacturing and developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt is certainly a contribution to bring the leaders of the two largest economies together for a meeting where they agreed to withdraw their most extreme tariff and export control threats. As a result, worst-case outcomes for global trade were averted, said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Apec is meant to be more than a venue for a trade war truce, Easley said. Greater multilateral efforts are needed to address the region's most pressing economic challenges, including resisting costly and destabilising protectionism, harmonising regulations for sustainable trade, and coordinating standards for digital innovation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSouth Korean officials said they've been communicating with other countries to prod all 21 members to adopt a joint statement at the end of the summit so as not to repeat the failure to issue one in 2018 in Papua New Guinea due to US-China discord over trade.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said last week that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among Apec members. He instead anticipated a broader declaration emphasising peace and prosperity in the region.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAs host nation, South Korea places a priority on discussing AI cooperation and demographic challenges such as aging population and low birth rates, under the theme Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSouth Korean officials say Apec members will share exemplary cases of responses to AI and demographic issues, explore common steps and formulate new growth strategies during this week's summit.</p><p></p></div>",

The sanctions have forced Russia to sell its oil at heavy discounts, and over the past three years India has become the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne crude.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIOC has bought about 3.5 million barrels of ESPO at about parity to Dubai quotes for delivery at an eastern Indian port in December, one of the trade sources said. The sources did not say who the sellers were.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside working hours.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe refiner had previously cancelled seven or eight cargoes of Russian oil after the announcement of the latest US sanctions as they were supplied by subsidiaries of sanctioned entities, two sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore the latest US sanctions, Rosneft was a major seller of ESPO oil.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMost Russian ESPO crude from the Pacific port of Kozmino has typically gone to China. However, demand from China has dropped after state refiners suspended purchases following US sanctions, while Chinese independent refineries have exhausted their import quotas. As a result, the price of ESPO crude has declined, making it attractive for Indian buyers.</p><p></p></div>",

The brokerage noted that over the past decade, the company has built a sustainable moat through full-spectrum capabilities across multiple dosage forms and a track record of successful speciality projects. Additionally, the company has developed robust manufacturing capacities, maintained a consistent compliance record in supplying to US markets, and focused on commercial success.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tConsidering a strong earnings CAGR of 43 per cent over FY25-28 and over 30 per cent RoE (adjusted for recent fresh issue), analysts at MOFSL believe Rubicon should command a premium valuation. \"Rubicon scores well ahead of peers in pharma space on ROE*earnings CAGR matrix,\" the brokerage said. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL values Rubicon Research at a 35x multiple (30 per cent premium to the sector multiple of 27x) on 12-month forward earnings, arriving at a target price of ₹740. The target implies a 21 per cent upside from Friday's closing price of ₹609.8. </div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\tAt 10:45 AM on Friday, the Rubicon Research stock was trading at ₹624, up over 2.3 per cent compared to the previous session's close of ₹609.8 on the NSE. The recently listed company's total market capitalisation stood at ₹10,232 crore.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHere's why Motilal Oswal holds a positive outlook on Rubicon Research:</h3>\n<h3>\r\n\tRubicon scales despite US generics headwinds </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL noted that despite challenges in the US generics market, including consolidation of buyers, faster ANDA approvals, increasing competition, and rising adverse inspection outcomes, Rubicon has scaled its business significantly, growing revenue from ₹390 million in FY15 to ₹12.8 billion in FY25, supported by focused R&amp;D, streamlined manufacturing, and strong compliance.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tScaled up portfolio with faster launches</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage further highlighted that Rubicon has rapidly expanded its commercial product portfolio from 18 in FY22 to 70 by June 2025, achieving an 86.4 per cent conversion rate from approvals to launches in Q1FY26. The company’s offerings span oral solids, oral liquids, nasal sprays, and topicals, with oral solids revenue growing at a 57 per cent CAGR to ₹11 billion over FY22–25, and oral liquids scaling from ₹43 million to ₹1.3 billion. In Q1FY26, OS/OL revenue rose 7 per cent/25 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹3 billion/₹355 million, while nasal spray revenue reached ₹124 million/₹80 million in FY25/Q1FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, Rubicon’s ₹2.8 billion R&amp;D spend over FY24–Q1FY26 supports ongoing product filings, including six ANDAs filed and six approvals in Q1FY26, underpinning strong revenue visibility through FY25–28.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNasal sprays are emerging as a key growth driver for Rubicon, contributing 2.3 per cent of revenue in Q1FY26, supported by its Ambernath facility. The US nasal spray market is set to grow at a 9.5 per cent CAGR through 2030, and Rubicon stands out with four of the 25 approvals granted between CY23 and June 2025.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRubicon’s CNS playbook</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to MOFSL, Rubicon is expanding its CNS business with three branded products - Equetro, Raldesy, and Lopressor OS—that have no AB-rated generic competitors as of July 2025. Equetro is FDA-approved for bipolar I disorder, Raldesy offers a novel oral liquid formulation of Trazodone for depression, and Lopressor OS provides flexible dosing for heart conditions. Increased focus on marketing to drive better business prospects in this segment for Rubicon.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tEnhanced focus on R&amp;D</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tRubicon’s R&amp;D spending stands at 11 per cent of revenue, significantly higher than the industry median of 6 per cent, highlighting its strategy to develop a broad product portfolio. The company also shows strong efficiency, generating one of the highest R&amp;D turnovers among peers, with US revenues from R&amp;D investments made two years ago. \"With FY25 US revenue nearly 6x its FY22-23 R&amp;D expenditure, Rubicon’s disciplined product selection and development approach is delivering solid results,\" MOFSL said.</div></div>",

He described it as \"the cherry on the icing of the cake\", adding that Tesla’s main focus is on products with a broader impact on sustainable energy.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMusk said the Roadster’s design was nearing completion and promised it would be \"something spectacular\", indicating that production was planned for 2025.

On the Ride the Lightning podcast this month, Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen confirmed that the company still aims to stage the demo within the given timeframe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked how long customers might have to wait after the demo to receive their cars, von Holzhausen said if everything goes according to plan, the new Tesla Roadster could hit the roads by the end of 2027.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tAltman-Musk tensions flare again</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAltman’s decision to cancel his Roadster order comes at a time when his feud with Musk is growing. Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015 but left the company in 2018, has often criticised both OpenAI and Altman, saying they have moved away from the group’s original goal of keeping research open to everyone.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn recent months, the two have exchanged several sharp remarks. Musk has also filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI. According to Bloomberg, Musk’s lawyer recently said they plan to continue the legal fight, criticising officials in California and Delaware for not stopping OpenAI’s shift into a for-profit company.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
