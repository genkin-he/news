India consumes around 10–11 million tonnes of DAP annually, making it the second-largest fertiliser consumed in the country after urea.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDAP is a key crop nutrient consumed during the rabi sowing season, which begins in a few weeks, and is widely used in the production of wheat and potatoes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn FY25, India imported close to 5 million tonnes of DAP, while the balance was produced domestically.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA few months ago, Saudi Arabia’s Maaden, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of DAP, signed a long-term agreement with three Indian fertiliser companies — Indian Potash Limited (IPL), KRIBHCO, and Chambal Fertilisers (CIL) — for the supply of 3.1 million metric tonnes of DAP annually for five years starting FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe agreement also includes a provision for a five-year extension based on mutual consent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Most domestic DAP made from imported raw materials</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost of the DAP manufactured locally in India is produced from rock phosphate, while some units manufacture DAP using imported phosphoric acid.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry sources said that a majority of the raw materials used for making DAP locally, such as rock phosphate, are imported because domestic grades are unsuitable for producing high-grade DAP. However, some units have facilities to produce phosphoric acid from rock phosphate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Import costs push losses despite higher subsidy</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrade sources said that assuming the current imported price of DAP is around $780 per tonne, it would translate into a value of around Rs 69,240.6 per tonne. To this, around Rs 1,000 per tonne is added for packing and handling, and a similar amount for finance and insurance fees.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTogether, this brings the total to around Rs 71,240.6 per metric tonne, with another Rs 3,462.03 added as taxes and duties.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn total, the expenditure on importing one tonne of DAP in India is currently around Rs 74,702.63, while the subsidy plus retail price account for around Rs 56,805 (Rs 27,000 retail price per tonne plus Rs 29,805 per tonne subsidy).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis leaves a gap of about Rs 17,897.63 per tonne, translating to a loss of roughly Rs 895 per 50-kg bag of imported DAP sold in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe calculation would differ for domestic manufacturers, as though the landed prices of rock phosphate and phosphoric acid have risen in recent months, they have not increased at the same rate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tMumbai city (area under BMC jurisdiction) is expected to record around 11,200 property registrations in October 2025, down 14 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y), mainly due to a high base, according to a report by Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe stamp duty collections are also expected to be around Rs 1,004 crore, down 17 per cent Y-o-Y. October last year had seen strong festive momentum driven by Navratri (3–11 Oct) and Diwali (1 Nov 2024). In contrast, this year’s festive activity was concentrated in September, with Navratri falling from 22 Sep–1 Oct and only Diwali (20 Oct) driving festive activity.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile lower than last year, numbers remained above the 11,000 mark, Knight Frank stated. On a month-on-month basis, registrations were down 7 per cent and stamp duty collections dipped 22 per cent. The registrations include new sales as well as re-sales.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Residential deals dominate registrations</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tResidential deals continued to dominate, accounting for about 80 per cent of total registrations during the month.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo far in 2025, Mumbai has recorded over 1.23 lakh property registrations, contributing more than Rs 11,151 crore to the state exchequer during this period. Property registrations observed a 4 per cent Y-o-Y growth during this period, while revenue grew by 11 per cent Y-o-Y. Sustained buyer confidence has fuelled consistent sales, driven by the city’s property registration growth, Knight Frank noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Festive timing impacts monthly trend, says Knight Frank</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShishir Baijal, chairperson and managing director, Knight Frank India, said, “Mumbai’s housing market continues to display depth and stability through 2025. While October saw a moderation from last year’s festive-driven high base, the city still recorded over 11,000 registrations, underscoring resilient underlying demand. The shift in the festive calendar advanced much of the celebratory buying to September, yet activity in October remained strong. The moderation in year-on-year growth is largely a function of the festive timing rather than any real market correction, highlighting the consistency and maturity of demand across segments.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Mid-income homes dominate, luxury share steady</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHomes priced below Rs 1 crore dominated, with their share rising from 45 per cent in October 2024 to 48 per cent this year. The Rs 1–2 crore category held firm at 31 per cent, indicating a stable core of mid-income demand, while the Rs 2–5 crore segment eased slightly to 16 per cent. The share of transactions worth over Rs 5 crore stayed unchanged at 6 per cent, pointing to consistent but limited luxury activity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Western suburbs lead market share; Central, South Mumbai follow</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWestern and Central Suburbs together accounted for 84 per cent of all registrations in October 2025, slightly lower than 86 per cent last year but still reflecting their dominant role in the city’s housing market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Western Suburbs led the market activity with a 55 per cent share, supported by strong traction in mid-range inventory. Central Suburbs followed at 29 per cent, while South Mumbai’s share rose to 10 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div>",

Does it matter', S Naren (ICICI AMC), Rajeev Thakkar (PPFAS AMC), Sailesh Raj Bhan (Nippon AMC), Mahesh Patil (Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC), and Rajeev Radhakrishnan (SBI AMC), discussed market volatility, India’s underperformance, and the outlook for equities and debt.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tGrowth temporarily slowed</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPatil attributed India’s underperformance to slower earnings and tighter policies. “India’s relative valuations versus other emerging markets had peaked,” he said. “Corporate earnings growth slowed to single digits, and restrictive fiscal and monetary policies added pressure.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the industry leaders agreed that the country is back on the growth track. Patil said: “With recent stimulus in the Budget and consumption recovery, we expect improvement ahead. Consumption, which was lagging, should get a boost due to goods and services tax (GST) cuts. Banking sector liquidity has also eased. Hence, corporate earnings growth should pick up.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Thakkar cautioned against expecting “hyper-normal” returns. “The last 12–15 months have gone by without major stock price movement,” he said. “Earnings have improved, but valuations in certain segments remain exuberant. Don’t expect explosive returns; equities should still outperform bonds over five years, but expectations must be realistic.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFavourable outlook for debt markets</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRadhakrishnan said the macro backdrop is positive for debt investors. “For the first time in years, we are not worried about inflation,” he said. “The RBI has created a favourable environment with policy easing and liquidity support. Fixed income markets now have the potential for stable, moderate returns.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that there is \"some more elbow room\" for the RBI to ease interest rates. \"Once that happens, there will possibly be a long pause,” Radhakrishnan said.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFintechs expanding reach</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tBhan said fintech platforms have broadened access to mutual funds. “Fintechs are doing a lot of the heavy lifting by reducing ticket sizes and bringing in new investors,” he said. “As the ecosystem matures, we’ll see more customers return to traditional fund houses.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the initial public offering (IPO) rush, he added: “In a bull market, supply is natural. It’s our job to ensure we buy the right business at the right price. When valuations look stretched, we prefer to stay cautious.”</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tInvestors carry the risk</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tNaren said that investors now shoulder most capital allocation risks. “In 2005-07, banks were the primary capital allocators and bore the brunt when things went wrong. Now, the burden has shifted to investors through direct equities, mutual funds, PMS, and alternative investment funds,” he said. “What many people haven’t realised in this cycle is that it’s the investors who are taking on all the risk. Over different cycles, the responsibility for risk has shifted, and this time, it squarely rests on investors.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThakkar said investors should use the Liberalised Remittance Scheme and GIFT City platforms for global diversification, noting that “overseas is available but it’s just that mutual funds don’t have much interest yet\". He cautioned against chasing gold and silver after their sharp rally driven by central bank buying, saying such assets lack cash flow and are “inherently unpredictable\".</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The senior technology lead, who works on Cloud Native platforms, shared his experience on Reddit, where it quickly drew attention from others in the tech community.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Visa rejection despite strong credentials</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I had my B1/B2 visa interview at the US Embassy today in Delhi, and I was rejected in less than a minute after just three questions. I’m trying to understand what went wrong and how I can improve for next time,” he wrote.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said the officer asked about his purpose of travel, previous international trips, and whether he had family or friends in the United States.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I wanted to visit the US to attend a conference called Kubecon + CloudNative Con 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a senior tech lead at a company and my day-to-day work is on Cloud Native technologies. It is important that I attend this conference to stay up to date on the latest events or movements in this field,” he explained.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked about travel history, he said, “I answered yes, I have travelled to Lithuania, Maldives and Indonesia,” and added that he said “no” when asked if he had family or friends in the US. Soon after, he was handed a 214(b) refusal slip.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Strong ties to India couldn’t prevent refusal</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe applicant said he was surprised by the quick rejection given his stable professional and personal background. “I’m employed in India with a stable job for the last 11 years. I make close to a crore annually and have an eight-month-old daughter, so I had very strong motivations to come back to India,” he wrote.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that he had prepared a detailed itinerary and confirmed bookings for the Atlanta conference and hotel accommodation. “The conference wasn’t available for live streaming, so I had planned everything to attend it in person,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe later asked others on the platform, “What do you think triggered the quick rejection? Could I have answered differently while still being honest? What steps would you recommend before reapplying?”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why Section 214(b) matters</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSection 214(b) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act is the most common reason for tourist visa refusal. It applies when an applicant fails to convince the consular officer that they will return to their home country after visiting the United States.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the US Department of State, a visa is a privilege, not a guaranteed right, and can be denied or revoked if the officer doubts an applicant’s intent or credibility. Even small inconsistencies or perceived weaknesses in ties to the home country can lead to refusal under this provision.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
