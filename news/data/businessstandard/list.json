Once in orbit, CMS-03 will provide multi-band communication services over a wide region that includes the Indian landmass and nearby ocean areas.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe CMS-03 satellite is designed to improve telecom, television broadcasting, and broadband services across India and its surrounding oceans. It will replace older satellites and help strengthen connectivity for remote regions, ships, and aircraft over the Indian Ocean.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How does the rocket work?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rocket works in three stages. In the first stage, two giant boosters called S200 solid boosters fire up together to lift the rocket off the ground. These boosters are packed with solid fuel that burns very quickly, producing a strong thrust to overcome the earth’s gravity. They burn for about 134 seconds (a little over two minutes) before separating and falling away once their fuel is used up.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the second stage, known as the L110 liquid core stage, the main liquid engine starts working while the solid boosters are still burning — about 113 seconds into the flight. It uses liquid fuel, which allows more precise control over the rocket’s movement. As the rocket climbs higher, about 115 km above the earth, the payload fairing (the top cover that protects the satellite during launch) opens and drops off since there’s no more air resistance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFinally, the third stage, called the C25 cryogenic stage, takes over after the liquid stage completes its job at around 313 seconds. “Cryogenic” means it runs on super-cold fuel stored at extremely low temperatures. This stage gives the final, powerful push needed to place the satellite into space. It continues burning until the satellite reaches its target — the GTO, a very high orbit roughly 36,000 km above the earth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why is the launch important?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIf the launch is successful, it will become the heaviest satellite ever launched from the Indian soil. It will reaffirm LVM3’s capability to let India launch heavy satellites independently, without depending on foreign launchers. Meanwhile, the CMS-03 will support digital connectivity, disaster management, and secure communication services, marking another major step forward in India’s space journey.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n</div>",
