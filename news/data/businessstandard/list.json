The return of the Palestinian remains was confirmed by a doctor at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, where medical workers were striving to identify them.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Gaza and Israel grapple with latest exchange of bodies</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tPhotos showed the remains, in white body bags, arranged in rows inside the grounds of Nasser Hospital. Health officials have struggled to identify bodies without access to DNA kits.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe handover brings the number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel to 225, only 75 of which have been identified by families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe bodies returned had been torn apart and exhumed, Munir al-Bursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, said in a post on X.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir flesh had melted, their faces erased by fire, leaving behind only bones and teeth, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Israeli military has previously told The Associated Press that all bodies returned so far are those of combatants, a claim the AP was unable to verify. The military has said it operates in accordance with international law.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAl-Bursh said recently that many of the bodies handed over appear to be fighters or others killed during the 2023 attack. Several relatives who have identified the bodies of family members said they weren't fighters.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late Thursday that the remains returned by Palestinian militants had been confirmed as those of Sahar Baruch and Amiram Cooper, both taken hostage during the 2023 attack.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHamas has now returned the remains of 17 hostages since the start of the ceasefire, with 11 others still in Gaza and set to be turned over under the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday a small crowd of Israelis gathered in the plaza known as Hostages Square, praying together for the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe cannot give up until everybody, all the bodies, will be here,\" said Rimona Velner, a Tel Aviv resident who joined the gathering. It's very important to the families and for us ... to close this circle.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Warning to Hamas</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tA senior US official and a second source familiar with negotiations said that in messages passed to Hamas by mediators on Wednesday, Israel warned the militant group that its fighters had 24 hours to leave the yellow zone or face strikes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat deadline passed Thursday evening, after which the senior US official said Israel will enforce the ceasefire and engage Hamas targets behind the yellow line. Hamas did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Shifa hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said that one person had been killed by Israeli gunfire in northern Gaza. Israel's military said its troops had fired after the person approached troops in a way that posed a threat.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a new assessment released Friday, the United Nations said satellite photos taken in early October show that 81 percent of all buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or otherwise damaged in the conflict.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGovernment officials from eight Arab and Muslim nations will gather in Istanbul on Monday to discuss the next steps for Gaza, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe talks follow a meeting between the countries' leaders and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations Security Council, preceding the ceasefire agreement. They mark the latest effort to create an International Stabilization Force in Gaza, outlined in a 20-point US plan.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ceasefire, which began October 10, is aimed at winding down a war that is by far the deadliest and most destructive of those ever fought between Israel and Hamas.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the October 2023 attack on Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the two years since, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 68,600 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and is staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIsrael, which some international critics have accused of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the figures without providing its own tally.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Israeli fire kills teen in West Bank</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tIn the central West Bank town of Silwad on Friday, mourners thronged the streets for the funeral of Yamen Hamed, 15, who Palestinian health officials say was shot by an Israeli soldier overnight. Samed Yousef Hamed kissed his son goodbye.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSamed said his son left home Thursday to hang out with friends. Soon after, he learned the teen had been injured and Israel's army was preventing an ambulance from reaching him. Ahed Smirat, the ambulance driver who tried to reach Hamed following the shooting, told the AP that troops held him up multiple times. By the time they let him through, troops told him the teen had died, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIsrael's military called the teen a terrorist and said troops had fired believing that he was holding an explosive, but did not provide any evidence to support that characterization. Hamed's funeral was Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe shooting is the latest in a surge of military killings of Palestinian children in the West Bank that has accompanied a general upswing in violence in the territory since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Some were killed during Israeli military raids in dense neighbourhoods, others by sniper fire in peaceful areas.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe killings have risen as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in the occupied West Bank since the war's onset in what it calls a crackdown on militants.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR INITIATE THE NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER, Trump said in a late night social media post Thursday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump's sudden decision to assert himself into the shutdown now in its 31st day bringing the highly charged demand to end the filibuster is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators toward their own compromise or send the chamber spiralling toward a new sense of crisis.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, the president few have dared to counter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSenate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules to end the shutdown, arguing that it is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe leader's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged, Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged. And former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump's filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding it's not my call, from his chamber across the Capitol.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster, Johnson said, adding that Trump's comments are the president's anger at the situation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Broad GOP support for filibuster</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tEven if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate, Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah posted on X Friday morning, responding to Trump's comments and echoing the sentiments of many of his Senate Republican colleagues. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn't. I'm a firm no on eliminating it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDebate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago. But they ultimately didn't have the votes after enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Little progress on shutdown</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tTrump's demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to becoming the longest in history.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said in his post that he gave a great deal of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why powerful Republicans allow the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut later Friday he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved. Democrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the health care subsidies. The Republicans say they won't negotiate until the government is reopened.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrom coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the centre of the stalemate.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tPeople are stressing, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe are well past time to have this behind us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Money for military, but not food aid</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's big, beautiful bill signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the programme.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday the agency cannot release contingency funds to keep SNAP running, an issue now facing a legal challenge in court.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWe are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care, said Rev. Ryan Stoess during a prayer with religious leaders at the US Capitol.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGod help us, he said, when the cruelty is the point.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Deadlines shift to next week</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe House remains closed under Johnson with no plans to resume the session, and senators left for the weekend and are due back Monday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIf the shutdown continues into next week, it would surpass the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the US-Mexico border wall.</p><p></p></div>",

Meanwhile, he's embraced Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaida fighter once held in an American prison in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut serious challenges remain, particularly in the Middle East. Gabbard noted in her brief remarks that the ceasefire in Gaza remained fragile. She also acknowledged Iran remained a concern as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said renewed movement has been detected recently at the country's nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe road ahead will not be simple or easy but the president is very committed down this road, said Gabbard, who attended the event as a government shutdown grinds on back home.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAn Associated Press journalist had been accredited and issued a visa to cover the summit, but the Bahraini government late Wednesday said it had been rescinded as it was conducting a post-approval review of that permission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe government did not elaborate on why the visa was revoked. Earlier that day, the AP published a story on long-detained activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja beginning an open-ended hunger strike in Bahrain over his internationally criticised imprisonment.</p><p></p></div>",

Interior Minister Guillermo Cataln followed suit on Friday.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRiding high off his party's surprise landslide win in Sunday's legislative elections and $40 billion in pledged funds from a friendly Trump administration, Milei announced that his main spokesperson, Manuel Adorni an ideological defender of the president's agenda known for his combative press conferences littered with sarcastic one-liners would replace the even-tempered Francos as Cabinet chief.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMany far-right supporters of Milei's anti-establishment platform viewed Francos, who hails from Argentina's traditional political elite, with suspicion. But political rivals and lawmakers hostile to Milei's agenda considered him a confidant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrancos was appointed chief of staff last year as the irascible political outsider sought help from the seasoned negotiator in persuading Congress to pass wide-ranging economic overhaul measures to trim the fiscal budget and spur foreign investment. Before his promotion, Francos served as interior minister, charged with managing Milei's tense relations with provinces opposed to the government's budget cuts.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMilei thanked Francos in a statement for his service to the nation during these last two years of profound reforms that required continuous dialogue with various political forces.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said that, starting on Monday, Adorni would assume the role of chief of staff in response to their party's resounding victory that surpassed pollsters' expectations, injected energy into faltering reforms and gave their scrappy libertarian party the numbers it needed in Congress to defend presidential vetoes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis change responds to the election results, the need to renew political dialogue and the beginning of this second phase, Milei said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough Milei's La Libertad Avanza bloc has boosted its numbers in Congress enough to prevent the left-leaning opposition from passing spending measures that undermine fiscal austerity, the party still lacks a majority.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTo see through his free-market overhaul of Argentina's economy, Milei has acknowledged the need to build alliances with centrist parties and win over influential provincial governors.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTop of the agenda will be liberalizing Argentina's labour market and simplifying its byzantine tax system big goals that have vexed right-wing governments before. To show his openness to dialogue, Milei welcomed 20 of Argentina's 24 governors to the presidential headquarters on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe four governors excluded from the meeting represented Peronism, the populist opposition movement widely blamed for delivering the economic shambles that Milei inherited in the 2023.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a TV interview with a local channel late Thursday, Mieli defended his decision to leave out the Peronist governors, saying, It's very hard to have a reasonable dialogue. We can't sit down with people for whom two plus two doesn't equal four.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",
