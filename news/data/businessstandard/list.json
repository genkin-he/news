The data does not distinguish between the different causes of delays, such as staffing shortages or bad weather.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tStaffing-related delays at Orlando's airport on Thursday, for example, averaged nearly four and a half hours for some time, according to the FAA.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMost controllers are continuing to work mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said. That leaves little time for a side job to help cover bills, mortgage and other expenses unless controllers call out.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDuffy said controllers are also struggling to get to work because they can't afford to fill up their cars with gas. Controllers missed their first full paycheck on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor this nation's air traffic controllers, missing just one paycheck can be a significant hardship, as it is for all working Americans. Asking them to go without a full month's pay or more is simply not sustainable,\" Nick Daniels, president of NATCA, said Friday in a statement.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLast weekend, a shortage of controllers led to the FAA issuing a brief ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Flights were held at their originating airports for about two hours Sunday until the FAA lifted the ground stop.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome US airports have stepped in to provide food donations and other support for federal aviation employees working without pay, including controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore the shutdown, the FAA was already dealing with a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.</p><p></p></div>",

Trump was interviewed by CBS' Norah O'Donnell Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine. But he has signalled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place.

He hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tParamount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
