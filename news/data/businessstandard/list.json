The shares are likely to list on the NSE and BSE on Wednesday, November 12, 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe IPO has been priced in the band of ₹95 to ₹100 per share, with a minimum lot size of 150 shares. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMUFG Intime India is the registrar, while  Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, JP Morgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, Axis Capital, and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors are acting as the book-running lead managers for the issue.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the RHP, Groww proposes to use ₹152.5 crore from the fresh issue towards cloud infrastructure and ₹225 crore for brand building and marketing. Another ₹205 crore will be utilised for its NBFC arm, GCS, to strengthen its capital base, and ₹167.5 crore for its subsidiary GIT for the MTF business. The remaining funds will be used for potential acquisitions and general corporate purposes.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHere are the key risks associated with investing in Groww IPO:</h3>\n<div>\n<strong>Market volatility risks:</strong> Groww operates in India’s investment and wealth management sector, where any slowdown or disruption in financial markets, driven by economic, policy, or global conditions, could materially affect its business and financial position. Its performance is closely linked to overall market stability and investor sentiment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Dependence on technology and platform:</strong> The company relies heavily on uninterrupted access to its technology platform for smooth operations. The performance, reliability, and capacity of its transaction-processing system and network infrastructure are crucial for attracting and retaining customers and delivering services. Any system failures or disruptions could negatively affect the availability or functionality of its website, mobile applications, or platform, potentially impacting its business.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Regulatory oversight:</strong> Groww operates under the supervision of regulatory and statutory authorities in India, including Sebi, RBI, and stock exchanges. Any changes or amendments to the applicable regulatory framework may have a significant impact on its business and operations, as per the RHP.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Dependence on customer acquisition: </strong>The company’s growth relies on its ability to attract and retain customers on its platform in a cost-effective manner. High levels of customer usage and engagement with its products and services are key indicators of platform interest. Failure to achieve this could negatively affect its operations, financial condition, and results.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Profitability risks:</strong> Groww reported losses in FY24 but recorded profits in FY23, FY25, and the three months ending June 30, 2025 and 2024. Inability to achieve sufficient revenue growth or effectively manage expenses and cash flows could jeopardise its sustained profitability.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHere are the key competitive strengths of Groww, as per the RHP:</h3>\n<div>\n<strong>Solid brand recognition:</strong> Groww is a widely recognised and preferred investing brand across cities, towns, and villages in India. According to Google Trends and NSE data for Fiscal 2025, Groww ranks highest in search interest among the top 10 brokers, reflecting the trust, popularity, and customer loyalty the platform has built, as per the Redseer Report.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Strong customer retention:</strong> The company maintains high customer retention and engagement, with 77.7 per cent of users staying active after three years on the platform. The company fosters long-term relationships by offering personalised content, updates, and tools that help customers make informed investment decisions. Cohort retention in the first quarter after acquisition has consistently ranged from 84.8 per cent to 92.98 per cent for cohorts from Fiscal 2022 to March 2025, highlighting strong customer loyalty and inelasticity to pricing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>In-House technology:</strong> Groww has developed most of its technology stack in-house, allowing the company to provide a superior customer experience at lower cost. Custom-built systems and infrastructure enable quick adaptation to customer demands and regulatory changes, supporting continuous product innovation, platform stability, and uninterrupted business operations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

The road ahead presents a mix of complexity and promise, shaped by the momentum of the energy transition, expanding global infrastructure, and accelerating digital transformation. These long-term forces are shaping demand across our industry, and TD Power System is strategically positioned to respond. Through focused investments in scale, engineering capabilities, and closer engagement with customers, the company is translating sectoral shifts into meaningful growth, said TD Power Systems in its FY25 annual report.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tData centre-related demand, in particular, is surging and expected to contribute to a 100 GW spike in US power demand by 2030. The management said the company is gearing up to address this with the development of larger generators in the 40–45 MW range, with deliveries scheduled to begin in fiscal 2026. This will position us well for a massive potential scale-up from fiscal 2027 onwards.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe hydro segment has also remained stable and is expected to grow in next coming years. This is primarily supported by the export and domestic market. This reliability highlights hydro’s role as a steady contributor in a dynamic energy sector.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe market for TD Power Systems Generators in North America, Central America, and South America continues to expand greatly. The current outlook for critical markets such as Oil &amp; Gas, onshore pipelines, fracking, and offshore drilling/production are improving under the new US Administration, which is limiting the barriers for new projects. Opportunities in the steam sector are active, particularly in Latin and South America for applications in sugar/ ethanol, pulp, biomass and waste heat markets, the company said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOverall, the European market grew significantly in FY25 and the trend is expected to continue with a positive growth rate of around 20 per cent in the coming year. Meanwhile, the Turkish market continues to face a significant downturn in local manufacturing projects, primarily due to the ongoing economic slowdown and the Government’s incentive policy favouring locally manufactured power equipment, including generators. This trend remains unchanged, and the outlook remains bleak, the company said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The Home &amp; Personal Care (HPC) segment remained the key driver, growing 8.9 per cent Y-o-Y, supported by a strong double-digit rise in oral care, while healthcare and foods &amp; beverages segments were muted, rising 1.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts attributed the subdued growth to the transitory impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) transition – 66 per cent of Dabur’s portfolio moved to the lower 5 per cent slab – along with delayed winter inventory-loading, which together hit volume growth by 300-400 basis points (bps). The impact was also visible in September and spilled over into early October.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGross and Ebitda margins expanded modestly by 10 and 20 bps Y-o-Y to 49.4 per cent and 18.4 per cent, respectively, aided by price hikes, cost optimisation, and a favourable mix. Management expects margins to remain range-bound in the medium term as GST-led pricing adjustments settle.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, on the bourses, Dabur share price dropped 2.56 per cent to hit an intraday low of ₹488.50 per share.

The brokerage noted that rural markets continued to outperform urban areas, while the oral care portfolio –  led by Dabur Red and Meswak – outpaced peers such as Colgate and Hindustan Unilever.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInCred said Dabur’s focus on rural distribution expansion and smaller pack sizes will help capture demand from GST rate benefits. The launch of Dabur Ventures, a new ₹500 crore investment platform to fund digital-first consumer brands, was seen as a positive long-term strategic move.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tNuvama: GST benefits, La Niña to aid winter recovery</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama Institutional Equities (Nuvama) retained its ‘Buy’ rating but trimmed its target price to ₹605 from ₹625, after cutting FY26-28 earnings estimates by 2-4 per cent to reflect weak beverages performance. The brokerage said Dabur’s revenue and Ebitda grew 5.4 per cent and 6.5 per cent year-on-year, in line with estimates, with the GST transition causing a ₹100 crore (about 3 per cent) hit to revenue.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama expects a stronger second half supported by a likely La Niña-induced harsh winter, which should boost healthcare and honey demand. It noted that 66 per cent of Dabur’s India portfolio now falls under the 5 per cent GST slab, improving affordability and competitiveness. Rural demand outpaced urban growth by 400–500 bps, it added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal: Downgrade to Neutral on weak execution</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal Financial Services downgraded Dabur from ‘Buy’ to ‘Neutral’ and cut its target price to ₹525 from ₹545, due to persistent execution challenges and muted management commentary for H2. While gross and Ebitda margins were broadly stable, the brokerage said Dabur’s revenue growth has been subdued for two years due to weak rural demand, extended monsoons, and slow channel restocking.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage lowered its valuation multiple from 45x to 40x, saying the expected GST benefits and winter portfolio recovery may not immediately translate into strong growth. “Dabur’s consistent weak execution is limiting our confidence in its growth recovery despite macros turning positive,” it said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tJM Financial: Inline results; Add retained</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJM Financial maintained its ‘Add’ rating with a target price of ₹535, saying the results were largely in line with expectations. It noted Dabur’s domestic FMCG business grew 5.7 per cent, with oral care and skin care leading gains, while international markets like the UK and Turkey performed well. Nepal, however, saw a 15 per cent decline due to political disruptions.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage said management’s conservative guidance of mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth in H2FY26 looks achievable, helped by GST rationalisation, expected colder weather, and steady rural demand. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Steady recovery in domestic sales will be key for rerating from current levels,” JM Financial analysts said, adding that valuations have already corrected below long-term averages.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tDabur: Cautious outlook</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile all  brokerages acknowledged stable margins and market share gains in key segments, the consensus pointed to limited near-term triggers. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost expect demand recovery to accelerate in the second half, supported by GST-led price adjustments, improving rural sentiment, and seasonal strength in health and wellness products. However, with target prices revised downward to and a split in rating, the <em>Street</em> sentiment on Dabur remains mixed.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
