After 20 unforgettable years on tour, however, it’s time... I’m officially hanging up my racquet. Starting my journey from a small town in Coorg, chopping blocks of wood to strengthen my serve and jogging through coffee estates to build stamina, it all feels surreal.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe expressed deep gratitude toward his parents, sister Rashmi, and his wife Supriya for their unwavering support:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“To my wife, Supriya, my greatest partner off court.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tThe Indian Council of Medical Research has successfully conducted animal trials using indigenously developed monoclonal antibodies for treating Nipah virus infection and has now sought collaboration with Indian industry partners for producing them to ensure their timely availability during outbreaks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMonoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the antibodies produced by the immune system to protect against foreign substances and harmful pathogens.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Nipah virus (NiV), which has an extremely high fatality rate, has emerged as one of the most significant zoonotic threats to India, with repeated outbreaks recorded since 2001, according to the Expression of Interest (EoI) document issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<p>\r\n\tThe apex health research body has issued an EoI stating: \"The ICMR is willing to collaborate with eligible organisations, companies, and manufacturers for the 'Development and Manufacturing of Monoclonal Antibodies against Nipah Viral Disease.'\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tGlobally, research and development efforts are advancing, but no licensed vaccine or antiviral is yet available.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe document stated that several vaccine platforms are under investigation, including those supported by CEPI, with one candidate having progressed to mid-stage human trials, with India identified as a key site. Similarly, research at other international institutes is ongoing to develop vaccine candidates.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"However, these are still years away from licensure. On the therapeutic front, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as the most promising option,\" the ICMR document said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe best-studied candidate is m102.4, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the G glycoprotein of the Nipah virus, which prevents viral entry by blocking its interaction with ephrin-B2/B3 receptors, according to the ICMR.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe m102.4 antibody has shown strong protection in animal models and has been found safe in Phase 1 clinical trials, it said. Though definitive human efficacy data are lacking, the antibody has been used under compassionate protocols in Australia and was also made available to Kerala during recent outbreaks, the EoI document stated.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe importance of having monoclonal antibody stocks ready for deployment in India cannot be overstated, the apex health research body said. Given the very high case fatality rate and the absence of licensed vaccines, mAbs represent the only currently feasible biomedical countermeasure, it said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir greatest value lies in post-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk contacts, such as healthcare workers exposed without adequate protection, family members in close contact, or laboratory personnel with accidental exposure. Administered early, they can potentially prevent disease onset, as demonstrated convincingly in animal models.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, in patients presenting early during infection, monoclonal antibodies may offer a therapeutic benefit by reducing viral load and limiting progression, thereby complementing supportive critical care, the document added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMaintaining ready access to such antibodies ensures that India can act swiftly during an outbreak, it said. Pre-positioned stocks, streamlined regulatory and ethical approvals, and defined clinical protocols for prophylaxis and therapeutic use would allow immediate deployment without delays, which often occur when arrangements are attempted in the middle of an outbreak.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This readiness, combined with continued strengthening of surveillance, infection control practices, and One Health investigations of bat reservoirs, will be critical for limiting the impact of Nipah virus outbreaks in the future,\" the document concluded.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Looking ahead, India needs to build its own indigenous medical countermeasures against the Nipah virus, particularly monoclonal antibodies,\" the ICMR said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to move forward through active collaboration with Indian industry partners for developing an indigenous monoclonal antibody platform and manufacturing stock, which will not only ensure timely and reliable access during outbreaks but also strengthen national preparedness for emerging viral threats, it added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ICMR-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, one of the constituent institutes of the Indian Council of Medical Research, has already initiated research and development in this direction, with experimental work at an advanced stage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ICMR-NIV has state-of-the-art laboratory infrastructure, including BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, and the team possesses expertise in outbreak investigations, surveillance, virological and molecular characterisation, vaccine candidate development through virus inactivation and molecular methods, and conducting preclinical trials in suitable animal models.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe institute also specialises in laboratory testing to evaluate antibody and immune responses in clinical trials at different phases (I, II, and III). The infrastructure and resources available at ICMR institutes, as indicated above at ICMR-NIV, will be leveraged for joint research, development, and preclinical studies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the EoI document, the ICMR and its institutes will provide expert guidance and technical support in all phases of research and development for the creation of monoclonal antibodies against Nipah viral disease.</p><p></p></div>",
