Therefore, you must give another chance to the NDA for the continuation of development measures taken by the double-engine government with the support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tIf the NDA government is voted to power again, the state will witness faster development, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I have not done anything for my family...the state's growth has always been my priority. I urge you people to vote for the NDA candidates in the polls and once again give us a chance to serve you and make 'Viksit Bihar' and one of the top states in the country,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe 243-member Bihar Assembly will go to polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with results set to be announced on November 14.</p><p></p></div>",
