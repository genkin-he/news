            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe country’s broking industry is in a “healthy pause” phase, a period of recalibration after the post-pandemic boom. Captains of the broking and wealth management industry believe market nervousness and tighter regulation in the derivatives segment have contributed to the slowdown, which is both expected and necessary.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking at the <em>Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025</em> in Mumbai, Shripal Shah, MD &amp; CEO, Kotak Securities; Pranav Haridasan, MD &amp; CEO, Axis Securities; Amisha Vora, chairperson and MD, PL Capital Group; and Ajay Menon, MD &amp; CEO - Retail Wealth, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, shared their insights on how the industry is evolving amid regulatory changes, rising compliance costs and an increasingly informed investor base.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCooling-off after record growth</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tFollowing an unprecedented surge during and after the pandemic, the broking industry has seen trading volumes and account openings moderate over the past year. “This pause is going to turn into a reboot mode,” said Shripal Shah of Kotak Securities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile derivative orders have dropped about 30 per cent from last year, he said the reset will prepare the industry for deeper market participation. “About 63 per cent of Indian households are aware of the capital market, but only 9.5 per cent participate. The next phase of growth lies in bridging that gap,” Shah said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tLong road to market penetration</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India’s equity participation continues to trail global peers, Pranav Haridasan of Axis Securities points out that market maturity evolves alongside rising income levels. “In the US, 55–60 per cent of people invest in equities, while China is around 18–20 per cent. India will see participation rise as per capita GDP improves,” he said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also cautioned that the journey ahead will be gradual. “Unlike the Covid-era spurt, this will be a secular, steady journey,” he said. The industry is now focusing on sustainable account growth and the right customer targeting, enabled by data and technology.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaridasan emphasised that awareness alone isn’t enough and education must accompany access. “There is a real need in financial services to teach the basics of investing really well,” Haridasan added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCompliance, cost and youth factor</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRising compliance and cybersecurity spending continue to shape the industry’s cost structure. Compliance costs have gone up by the day, from cyber safeguards to account opening norms. But this discipline will strengthen the ecosystem, opines Amisha Vora of PL Capital Group.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVora also noted how new investors are reshaping market dynamics. “Over 50 per cent of new accounts in the industry were opened in North and East India. less than 50 per cent of new accounts were opened in the western and southern regions, which are considered more financially literate,” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd, the young demographic will be central to long-term market growth in India. “More than half of new investors are below 30 years of age, their continued participation, directly or through mutual funds, is a structural positive,” she said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tFrom short-term gains to long-term vision</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile digital access has democratised investing, the challenge lies in converting new traders into disciplined, long-term investors. Ajay Menon of Motilal Oswal Financial Services pointed out that retail investors are maturing fast. “Investors are smart. They know that consistently putting money into the market will give them long-term growth in their overall investment journey,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDiversification remains key to wealth creation, with a focus on spreading investments across mutual fund SIPs, insurance, and alternate assets to strengthen clients’ long-term wealth journeys, Menon said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also underscored the importance of systematic investing, “From a retail investor’s perspective, there needs to be some amount of investment into mutual fund SIPs, since it gives you a sustained growth journey.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tDigital push for the sector</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile discount brokers have transformed the landscape, full-service players are keeping pace through digital innovation and advisory depth. “Today, a full-service broker can offer a digital platform as advanced as any discount player, with the added advantage of research and education,” said Shripal Shah of Kotak Securities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that industry consolidation will be driven less by regulation and more by the need for technology investment and resilience, Shah said. The panellists at the BS BFSI Insight Summit agreed that as AI-driven advisory, financial education and responsible leverage take root, India’s broking industry will emerge stronger.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tConsolidation and the road ahead</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tLooking ahead, the industry leaders agreed that consolidation is inevitable as compliance, technology and cybersecurity requirements demand scale. “Smaller players may merge or exit, but innovation will continue,” Shah said. “There’s still a lot of potential in AI-led advisory and automation.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaridasan emphasised that the industry’s fundamentals remain strong. The broking industry has taken a pause, but it’s rebooting. With AI, data analytics and rising financial literacy, the next phase will be more efficient, inclusive and resilient, he shared. </div></div>",

            "id": 125103101250,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWith Indian markets yet to hit new highs in 2025, <strong>Mark Matthews</strong>, managing director and head of research for Asia at Julius Baer, tells <em>Puneet Wadhwa</em> in a fireside chat that India is the only essential emerging market for global portfolios. India’s two big strengths, he believes, are its demographics and 'Jugaad' – the ‘can-do’ spirit. Edited excerpts:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you assess the year 2025 for global financial markets, excluding India?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn one word, surprising. Truth be told, if you had asked me in January 2025 how global markets would perform this year, I would have said there was over a 50 per cent chance they would be down. Yet here we are, with the bellwether equity index, the S&amp;P 500, up 17 per cent, much better than the long-term average. It has been a surprising year. What’s even more incredible is that emerging markets (EM) as a whole are up over 30 per cent. So yes, it’s been a really surprising year, and that makes me somewhat uncomfortable forecasting the next one.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The US markets have made consistent highs throughout 2025, whereas the Indian markets have done so just once at the benchmark level. Would you say the Indian markets have decoupled from the US?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo. The Nifty is up about 6 to 7 per cent in US dollar terms. That’s a perfectly good return — annualised, it's around 11 to 12 per cent. So, it’s not that India has gone down, but it has underperformed the US and its emerging market peers. There are two main reasons for this. First, China. A year ago, Indian fund managers feared that China would become investable again, and it has. Second, corporate earnings in India have disappointed, but are nearing an inflection point. With goods and services tax (GST) cuts kicking in late September, along with monetary easing, income tax cuts, and a favourable base, fiscal year 2027 could see double-digit earnings growth. In the September quarter results, the number of misses are half what it was in the previous two quarters. Nearly 20 per cent of the companies that reported results have missed, as compared to about 40 per cent for the previous two quarters.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Were Indian markets boring in 2025 as risk reward seemed favourable elsewhere; disappointing in terms of returns; or challenging in terms of lack of investment opportunities?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI would describe India as a rather boring market this year. To be honest, I’ve been catching up on developments in China, which has made a big comeback. China’s progress across several high-technology sectors has been remarkable.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the US market nearing a bubble, especially given the performance of the 'Magnificent 7' technology stocks?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tYou could define a bubble either by valuations or by technicals. Surprisingly, by neither measure is the US market in a bubble yet.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Nasdaq-100 has not deviated significantly from its long-term trend, unlike the dot-com bubble of 1998–1999, which was about three standard deviations above the average. Currently, it’s less than one standard deviation above trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs for valuations, the forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of the Magnificent 7 is about 33 times for the next 12 months and around 23 times for the next 24 months. In contrast, during the 1990s bubble, major tech stocks were trading at about 50 times PE. So, the US market is not yet in bubble territory.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the lack of AI investment by Indian IT companies a concern?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo, quite the contrary. The danger lies in the scale of artificial intelligence (AI) spending by hyperscalers. This year alone, the big five are investing $375 billion, and over the next three years, about $1.1 trillion, more than the size of the German stock market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe risk is that these companies may not earn adequate returns. AI will benefit the broader economy through productivity and efficiency gains, but the companies making massive upfront investments bear the real risk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What returns do you expect from Indian equities over the next year?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOver the long-term, I believe small and mid-caps will outperform simply because they have more room to grow. For the next 12 months, I expect returns of around 15 per cent, driven by expected earnings growth of about 16-18 per cent for the Nifty in fiscal year 2027. The market isn’t expensive relative to peers, and as earnings momentum picks up, there is room for re-rating.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What could drive Indian markets over the next three to five years?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia’s two big strengths are its demographics and its 'Jugaad' – the ‘can-do’ spirit. India has more people entering the prime earning age (30–60 years) than any other country, and this advantage should last until around 2060. The second factor, Jugaad, reflects India’s positive, problem-solving attitude, which is often lacking elsewhere.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What’s your view on gold and silver?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tGold, historically, has returned about 5 per cent per year in dollars and serves as a hedge against inflation. Recent price increases are not unusual, they’re partly due to geopolitical tensions and the confiscation of Russian assets, which has undermined trust in Western financial systems.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI expect gold to correct modestly to around $3,500 per ounce before rising to $4,500 within a year. Some optimistic projections even see it reaching $6,600 eventually, and yes, I think that’s possible.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>For investors looking to enter India now, is this the right time, or should they look elsewhere?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia is fairly priced. Earnings growth looks solid for next year. India is the only essential emerging market for global portfolios — you don’t need Brazil, Indonesia, or Turkey, but you do need India, which has consistently delivered strong returns and should continue to do so.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Just as mutual funds and insurance became household names, alternatives are following suit.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Jain, the next phase of growth will hinge on domestic capital pools connecting India’s deep savings ecosystem with private equity and venture capital. “Every large economy eventually funds itself domestically. India is reaching that stage,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tMarket-beating returns</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra, partner at Samara Capital, highlighted that private equity has consistently outperformed public markets globally, and India’s story mirrors that trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Globally, PE has outperformed public markets by about 6–7 per cent on a 10-year rolling basis,” he said. “In India, deal flow has picked up sharply. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices are increasing allocations to alternative funds — from 7–8 per cent now to a projected 15–16 per cent.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe identified three pillars driving mainstreaming: fundraising, deal flow, and exits. “We now have vibrant opportunities in growth capital, buyouts, and even secondary exits. IPOs, domestic M&amp;As, SME listings — all of these complete a healthy investment cycle,” Kabra added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExits and buyouts mark a new phase</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKedaara Capital’s founder and managing partner Kejriwal said India’s “sweet spot” stems from improved exit markets and a cultural shift among family-owned businesses. “Fifteen years ago, India was good at attracting capital but not returning it,” he said. “That’s changed. We’ve had robust IPOs, sponsor-to-sponsor sales, and rising acceptance among business families to sell strategic stakes. Selling is no longer seen as a mark of shame,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuyouts, once rare, now account for half of all private equity deals, noted Gopalakrishnan. “In 2013, buyouts made up just 20 per cent of the market. With succession planning more common and the economy larger, both the pool of opportunities and transaction sizes have risen.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s scale advantage</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India becomes the world’s fifth-largest economy, global investors are paying closer attention. “Private equity works in large and sophisticated economies,” said Gaja Capital’s Jain. “Until recently, India was neither large nor sophisticated enough. That’s changed. We now have the scale, entrepreneurs, and IPO markets to support sustained private equity growth.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKejriwal added that while India remains an “entrepreneurial country of immense depth”, the PE industry is still at the level of a cottage industry. “We’ve barely scratched the surface. The best years are yet to come,” he predicted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI and the next investment wave</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn whether artificial intelligence (AI) will reshape investment patterns, Kejriwal struck a cautious tone: “We’re not chasing the AI hype. For us, the focus is on how our portfolio companies adopt AI efficiently, rather than betting on untested products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is a constant game of adapting. Our job is to future-proof the businesses we invest in,” said Gopalakrishnan.</div></div>",

We are also in discussions with foreign clients for orders. With the capacity we have, we are very keen to become a global player,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe 600-acre facility can undertake multiple projects of very large (VL) class vessels concurrently, and the company is looking at opportunities in small and medium sizes as well, where the government has a major push, especially for crude oil vessels in the immediate future.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/specials/bs-events/sebi-chief-stresses-responsible-tech-use-stronger-market-resilience-125103100884_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sebi chief stresses responsible tech use, stronger market resilience</a></strong></div></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Commercial shipbuilding is bound to pick up. All of us are gearing up with the hope that the demand generated will build self-reliance in commercial shipbuilding. The demand will come from the public and private sectors as their commercial vessels were being built outside India — now these will come to India,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSDHI recently brought in Korean shipbuilding giant Samsung Heavy Industries for technical assistance, and the company will tap the latter’s expertise for large specialised orders as it plans its global foray.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the brownfield expansion programme of the scheme, existing shipyards can avail assistance of 25 per cent of the capital expenditure undertaken. The government has dedicated a corpus of ₹8,250 crore for the scheme.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company is also looking to enter the cranes and port equipment space in a big way, Saxena said. This segment has been largely untapped, and there are only a few players in India.

Building such capability, both within Sebi and across market institutions, will remain our key priority,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia’s capital markets have become a pillar of economic growth, underpinned by reforms that have made them more efficient, inclusive and resilient. India’s financial system functions as an interconnected ecosystem linking banks, corporates, mutual funds, insurers, pension funds and fintechs through a web of transactions, he noted.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“These linkages bring efficiency and expand access to capital, but they also make the system more complex.

Market capitalisation has increased from 69 per cent of GDP in FY16 to around 129 per cent, while companies have raised almost Rs 7 trillion through equity and debt issuances in the current financial year till September.

These include stronger governance frameworks for exchanges and clearing corporations, tighter liquidity norms and stress testing for mutual funds, and improved transparency in the corporate bond market. Sebi has also revised norms for initial public offerings (IPOs) by small and medium enterprises and equity derivatives to ensure market integrity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo enhance ease of doing business, Sebi has simplified IPO and listing processes, digitised filings, streamlined KYC norms and proposed relaxed requirements for NRIs. It has also set clear approval timelines and improved grievance redressal.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey said Sebi continues to foster market innovation. The regulator has expanded the scope of strategic investors in REITs and InvITs, reclassified REITs as equity for mutual fund investments, and introduced put options in non-convertible securities to enhance liquidity.

At a panel discussion on 'Deepening India’s Equity Capital Markets' on day 1 of <em>Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025</em>, leading bankers noted that India’s growing self-reliance in capital formation is reshaping fundraising dynamics.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tFinancialisation fuels primary market growth</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Sonia Dasgupta, MD &amp; CEO, Investment Banking, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/jm-financial-ltd-share-price-2113.html\" target=\"_blank\">JM Financial</a>, India’s financialisation of savings has been transformational. “Since 2020, we have seen equities, mutual funds and other savings instruments grow from 3 per cent to nearly 17 per cent. That reflects a massive pool of domestic demand,” she said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Dasgupta, this surge has enabled a lot of repricing in the secondary market and layered a vibrant phase of primary market activity. The rise of digital technology and early-stage investors realising their companies are ready to list has also contributed, she said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Many new-age firms have delivered returns, encouraging others to take that risk and list. The ease of moving money has smoothed the rails for larger issuances,” she added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><div class=\"wrap-iframe\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G32MyRy6sNY?si=Bc1UCERClwnalbLO\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tReduced dependence on foreign capital</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Gesu Kaushal, MD and co-head, Equity Corporate Finance, Kotak Mahindra Capital, India’s market buoyancy stems from a stable macroeconomic environment and the rise of large domestic pools of capital. “Our dependence on foreign portfolio investors has reduced,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKaushal added that process efficiency has improved retail participation dramatically. “For IPOs, the ease of investing has played a huge role. About 70 per cent of retail investors now apply through UPI, leading to far more applicants than before,” he noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tDomestic institutions lead the charge</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe deepening of local markets has also been enabled by stronger institutional capabilities. Sunil Khaitan, MD and head of financing, Goldman Sachs India, said domestic mutual funds and institutions now have the “capital and intellectual ability” to back innovative business models. “They get listed and trade very well here,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKhaitan identified three key drivers of market activity - growth equity, monetisation, and balance sheet repair. “It is in the issuer’s interest that IPOs are priced well, as they remain large shareholders in the listed entity,” he said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, he cautioned that some investors treat IPOs as an asset class, investing without due diligence, which “increases the chances of losses\".</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tMNC listings reflect market maturity</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmitabh Malhotra, vice-chairman, Capital Markets and Advisory, HSBC India, said multinational corporations are also recognising India’s market maturity. “Earlier, MNCs preferred to list in their home markets.

The discussion among India’s top treasury and markets heads centred on how fund managers, policymakers, and investors are balancing liquidity, growth, and financial risk amid an evolving macroeconomic landscape.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tGlobal markets show resilience amid uncertainty</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAditya Bagree, managing director and head – markets, India &amp; South Asia at Citi, believe global equity markets have held up surprisingly well despite multiple shocks in recent years. “There have been several events over the past three to four years that could easily have caused global turmoil. Yet, the global economy and markets have held up remarkably well. Much of that is due to strong policy support and new growth drivers like AI investments,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBagree pointed out three key trends shaping the United States economy: high unemployment rate, concerns about inflation due to Trump tariffs, and the concentration of growth in AI-related sectors, such as data centres and energy infrastructure. He said while the US is likely to begin its rate-cutting cycle soon, it is likely to be gradual and spread across the coming year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><div class=\"wrap-iframe\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6obc_-n7QXU?si=NKrM0nnFmfxa-ozJ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI driving growth</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tShailendra Jhingan, head – treasury &amp; economic research at <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/icici-bank-ltd-share-price-5418.html\" target=\"_blank\">ICICI Bank</a> agreed that AI-driven investments are underpinning current growth in the US, though this growth is narrowly concentrated. “Almost two-thirds of US GDP growth in the first half of the year came from AI-related investments, not just in chips but in power, air conditioning, and supporting infrastructure,” Jhingan said. “However, weak labour market means weak consumption, and that is a real concern.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile Jhingan expects the US Federal Reserve to cut rates to support employment, he warned that inflationary pressures could return once corporates begin passing on higher tariff costs to consumers. “So far, US corporations have absorbed most of the cost increases, but that can’t continue indefinitely,” he added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the wave of AI-led investment was also leading to layoffs in some technology sectors, pointed out Arup Rakshit, group head – treasury, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/hdfc-bank-ltd-share-price-4987.html\" target=\"_blank\">HDFC Bank</a>. “Job losses are becoming visible, and that’s another reason rate cuts are likely to begin soon,” he said. Rakshit expects the US Fed to pause after two or three cuts to reassess the inflation trend.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s growth outlook and policy support</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tTurning to India, Jhingan said the need for aggressive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appears limited at this stage. “Growth indicators are improving, liquidity remains stable, and fiscal measures, including tax relief and capital expenditure, have already provided a cushion,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that RBI’s earlier 100 basis point rate cut, combined with ₹7.4 trillion liquidity infusion, has already begun showing impact. “We are seeing early signs of capex recovery. So, while RBI may opt for another rate cut in December, the broader stance will likely be to pause and observe,” Jhingan said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBagree echoed the sentiment, noting that while India’s inflation remains comfortably within the target range, the case for another rate cut remains debatable. “Inflation has averaged around 2.3 per cent this year, and the rural economy has held up well. Between monetary easing, fiscal incentives, and GST cuts, enough stimulus has already been injected,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRakshit of HDFC Bank added that the RBI might still go ahead with a “symbolic rate cut” in December, particularly if the US begins easing. “If inflation numbers remain benign and the festive momentum sustains, a rate cut in December becomes more likely,” he said.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tFPI flows: Passive money stable, active money cautious</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn foreign portfolio flows, panellists at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit agreed that while passive inflows into Indian debt have been steady following the JP Morgan index inclusion, active flows remain strategic and rate-sensitive.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAditya Bagree of Citi pointed out that Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) currently hold only about 3.2 per cent of outstanding Indian government paper, with room for growth if Bloomberg includes Indian bonds in its global index next year. “The trend in FPI flows into emerging market debt remains strong, as emerging markets today have better fiscal and inflation metrics than many developed economies,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“On the equity side, we’ve seen around $15–16 billion in outflows this year, largely due to concerns around corporate profitability, valuations, and tariff uncertainties. Interestingly, much of the global equity capital has moved to AI-linked markets such as China and South Korea. We expect that as tariff concerns fade, growth stabilises, and valuations normalise, equity flows will start returning to India,” Bagree said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRakshit agreed, saying, “Passive flows will continue, but foreign money will not dictate Indian yields as domestic investors will remain the main driver.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCorporate bonds lose steam</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe panel also spoke about the slowdown in corporate bond issuance as companies increasingly turn to the loan market. Jhingan said, “With repo-linked loan rates proving cheaper than corporate bonds, corporate bond issuances have dipped from ₹3.6 trillion in the first quarter to ₹2 trillion later.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBagree drove the conversation to India’s bond market that continues to be dominated by domestic institutional investors such as mutual funds, insurance companies, and banks. “The bond market in India is largely driven by domestic institutional investors. Demand has eased recently due to certain regulatory and tax changes, raising the question of how we can revive that appetite,” Bagree said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRakshit added that accounting changes and the revised large exposure framework have further dampened demand for corporate bonds. “The loan market offers more flexibility and lower costs, so the preference shift is evident,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tThe rupee outlook</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tTalking about rupee, Bagree acknowledged recent underperformance but attributed it largely to seasonal factors such as education and defence outflows during the July–September quarter.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This quarter is typically weak for the rupee, but we expect some recovery as portfolio inflows return and seasonal outflows ease,” he said. “Foreign investors have been underweight on India, but improving corporate profitability and global rate cuts could change that.”<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <em><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/video-gallery/general/business-standard-bfsi-summit-2025-177986.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Catch all coverage of the Business Standard BFSI Summit 2025 Day 1 here.</a></em></div></div>",

We are also searching. Our teams have gone to Argentina and their ministers have also come here.
