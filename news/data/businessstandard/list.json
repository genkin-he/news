It was a daunting total, built on dominance — but India had other plans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite losing Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana early, Rodrigues and Harmanpreet steadied the innings with a match-defining partnership. The duo’s calculated aggression and calm under pressure sapped the Australian bowlers’ confidence.

Jemimah sprinted towards her partner, arms wide, eyes glistening — and soon, the entire Indian team enveloped them in a jubilant embrace. Smriti Mandhana reached them first, laughter and tears blending in a moment that captured what years of toil and heartbreak had built toward.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe stands erupted.

For years, Australia had been the immovable mountain. Tonight, that mountain moved.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRodrigues’ innings will be remembered alongside the greats — not just for its beauty and precision, but for its context. This was her first ODI World Cup, and she carried India to their first-ever World Cup final berth with an innings of rare grace and grit.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHarmanpreet’s leadership, calm and commanding, underpinned a side that no longer plays with fear or deference. The young guns — Charani, Ghosh, Deepti — all played their parts in a team that now exudes belief.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis match may well be remembered as the turning point — when Indian women’s cricket stopped chasing dreams and began living them.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Brief Scores</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAustralia: 338 in 50 overs (Phoebe Litchfield 119, Ellyse Perry 77, Ashleigh Gardner 65; Deepti Sharma 2/73, Shree Charani 2/49).</div>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia: 341/5 in 48.3 overs (Jemimah Rodrigues 127 not out, Harmanpreet Kaur 89; Kim Garth 2/46).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The road ahead</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia now face South Africa in the final — a clash that could deliver the country’s first Women’s World Cup crown.

A few years later, the company overhauled its structure again so that the nonprofit would have oversight and control over the for-profit arm. The main goal of the nonprofit was to ensure that OpenAI developed AI technology safely, rather than prioritizing profits like a traditional company.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis week, OpenAI revamped itself yet again. It is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but the nonprofit has a 26 per cent stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. This change makes the nonprofit a significant stakeholder in OpenAI's financial success.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tA successful offering would mark a major win for investors such as SoftBank, Thrive Capital and Abu Dhabi's MGX. Microsoft, one of its biggest backers, now owns about 27 per cent of the company after investing $13 billion.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe deliberations come as AI is driving a surge in public markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud company CoreWeave went public at a $23 billion valuation and has roughly tripled since. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value, powered by a rally that has cemented its role at the center of the global AI boom.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the possibility of OpenAI going public as early as 2027.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

This decision will systematically phase out a significant number of older vehicles from Delhi's roads, giving a direct boost to our efforts in improving air quality and decongesting our city, said Delhi Transport minister Pankaj Singh.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe step has been proposed in light of numerous public representations and internal reviews.

During the first six months of the financial year – April-September – India's goods exports rose to $220.12 billion from $213.68 billion a year earlier. However, this was mainly because exports to the US were being frontloaded. The real impact on trade and whether diversification is taking place will be clear October/November onwards, government officials had said in the past.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
