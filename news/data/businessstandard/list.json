Its companion brand, RailYatri, is a popular digital platform for train travel in India, providing a simplified train ticket booking experience along with comprehensive trip data and insights, serving more than 12 million users monthly.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The investment will be used to further raise the bar on customer satisfaction, operational excellence and service expansion,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), IntrCity SmartBus. “This investment will also help our operator-partners to grow and monetise their asset portfolio faster with us.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMuch of this is driven by the company’s technology backbone. IntrCity has developed a suite of proprietary tools,  including an operator dashboard, crew app, and IoT-enabled fleet analytics system, that help manage daily operations across its expanding network. These platforms enable real-time tracking, accurate ETA visibility, dynamic route management, and centralised monitoring of every journey. From automated luggage management to predictive maintenance insights, the company’s tech stack is designed to bring efficiency to a category that has traditionally lacked both.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“They have built a trusted, pan-India brand through exceptional quality, consistency and customer service,” said Gautam Mago, general partner at A91 Partners. “This provides a platform to build a category-defining leader in inter-city mobility.

Given the country’s huge population and rapid urbanisation, there is an increasing demand for various modes of transportation, including personal and public.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia’s expanding highway network is fueling a surge in the country’s intercity travel sector, particularly the outstation bus market. The segment is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10 per cent to 13 per cent between fiscals 2020 (FY20) and 2025, according to a report by IntrCity SmartBus and consulting firm 1Lattice.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report estimated India’s overall outstation travel market at $66 billion in FY20, with bus travel accounting for about $30.3 billion, or roughly 45% of the total. While the pandemic slowed demand in FY21 and FY22, the rebound since then has been strong.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMuch of the sector’s recent momentum is being powered by full-stack technology aggregators, such as IntrCity SmartBus and Zingbus. These players are using end-to-end digital platforms to streamline operations, improve reliability, and enhance passenger experience — changes that are reshaping one of India’s most vital modes of intercity transport, the report notes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile India’s roads and highways have improved significantly, the country still lacks adequate bus infrastructure, especially around cities, according to Raizada of IntrCity SmartBus.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite better vehicles and connectivity, poor bus terminals and facilities remain a major barrier to public transport adoption, he noted. Raizada pointed to the imbalance in public spending, saying that far more money goes into building airports than bus terminals, even though bus travel serves a much larger population.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If taxpayer money can fund airports, it should also fund bus ports,” he said. He added that better terminals, parking, rain shelters, clean food, and drinking water are essential to make bus travel more appealing. Without these, he warned, car travel may overtake buses due to infrastructure gaps, not preference.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe urged that transit points be developed with metro and taxi connectivity to make bus travel more convenient.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tIn a rare medical phenomenon, four sisters from West Virginia — Austyn, Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee Higginbotha, have all been diagnosed with Chiari malformation. It is a structural defect in the skull that affects how the brain sits and functions. Doctors have described the case as extremely unusual, given that such clustering in one family is exceptionally rare.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat is Chiari malformation?</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, Chiari malformation (CM) occurs when part of the brain, known as the cerebellum, extends into the spinal canal through an opening at the base of the skull (foramen magnum). As per Dr David Harter, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone, this happens when the lower portion of the brain doesn’t fit properly within the skull. This can block the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid and put pressure on the brain as well as the spinal cord.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe condition is often congenital (condition or trait that is present at birth) but may not show symptoms until later in life. Common signs include:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\t Severe headaches – especially when coughing or straining</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDizziness</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tBalance problems</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tMuscle weakness</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tNumbness in the limbs</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tHeart palpitations</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDifficulty falling asleep and chronic fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome cases also involve tethered spinal cords, where the spinal cord is abnormally attached, causing restricted movement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tHigginbotham sisters’ story</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe family’s journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, started showing worrying symptoms as a baby such as constant crying, poor sleep, tremors, and developmental delays. At 18 months, she was diagnosed with Chiari malformation and spinal compression, requiring surgery to relieve pressure and restore fluid flow.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSoon after, her sister Amelia, aged three, was diagnosed with the same condition and a tethered spinal cord. She underwent two surgeries in October 2023. Then, Aubrey, aged seven, developed similar symptoms and had surgery a month later, in November 2023. The eldest affected sister, Adalee aged 11, had struggled with leg pain and mobility issues for years before being diagnosed. Her surgery was performed in March 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe girls have since recovered well, with their mother noting that Austyn “was trying to walk, smiling, full of energy” shortly after surgery. The two elder kids were also tested, and did not have the condition.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Jeffrey Greenfield, pediatric neurosurgeon at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, who treated the sisters, described the occurrence as “extraordinary”, noting that only about 10 per cent of Chiari cases have a known genetic link, and it is even rarer for several siblings within the same family to be affected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tThe road to recovery</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTreatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the level of pressure on the brain and spine. In serious cases, decompression surgery is performed to remove a small portion of bone at the skull base, helping normalise fluid flow. According to US-based Cleveland Clinic, many patients experience significant relief post-surgery, though some may need follow-up procedures.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAll four Higginbotham sisters are now recovering under regular medical supervision. Early detection and intervention have been crucial in improving their outcomes. Without treatment, Chiari malformation can lead to chronic pain, nerve damage, or paralysis.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhy this case matters</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThis rare case underscores the importance of awareness and early diagnosis. Multiple siblings being diagnosed with the same structural brain defect highlights the potential genetic factors behind Chiari malformation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDoctors recommend that families with one diagnosed child consider screening siblings if symptoms appear. Recognising early warning signs such as persistent headaches, neck pain, or motor issues can make a life-changing difference.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Higginbotham family’s experience serves as both a medical mystery and a hopeful reminder: with timely diagnosis and specialist care, children with Chiari malformation can recover and live normal lives.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe INDIA bloc’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/elections/bihar-elections\" target=\"_blank\">Bihar election</a></strong> manifesto has set off a heated debate with its ambitious pledge -- a government job for one member of every family. Unveiled by <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rashtriya-janata-dal\" target=\"_blank\">Rashtriya Janata Dal</a></strong> (RJD) leader <strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tejashwi-yadav\" target=\"_blank\">Tejashwi Yadav</a></strong> in Patna on October 28, the promise, if implemented, would mark one of the most sweeping welfare commitments in India’s political history.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut can Bihar’s finances and its administrative system afford it?</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tHow many families are in Bihar?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar’s projected population is about 130.7 million, and the 2023 caste survey identifies around 27.6 million families. With an average household size of 4.9 persons, this aligns with official estimates of 26–27 million households.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf taken literally, Tejashwi’s promise would mean creating 27 million new government jobs -- a number that dwarfs India’s total central and state government workforce combined.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhat would it cost the state?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven a conservative calculation shows the enormity of the challenge. Covering 25.6 million uncovered families with an average salary of ₹2.5 lakh per year, which is roughly the starting pay of an entry-level teacher, would cost ₹6.75 trillion annually, nearly double Bihar’s FY26 budget outlay.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar’s total FY26 outlay stands at ₹3.17 trillion, with expenditure (excluding debt repayment) of ₹2.94 trillion and receipts (excluding borrowings) of ₹2.61 trillion. Committed expenses, such as salaries, pensions, and interest payments, already consume 42 per cent of revenue receipts.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, Bihar’s fiscal deficit cannot exceed 3 per cent of GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product), which is about ₹32,718 crore for FY26. So any additional salary burden of this magnitude would shatter that ceiling.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWho are Bihar’s biggest employers now?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgriculture remains Bihar’s largest employer, followed by education, health, and policing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\tEducation: Over 6,00,000 teachers and staff, including contractual workers</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tPolice: Around 1,10,000 lakh personnel, with 64,000 more posts planned</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tHealth: Around 66,000 positions, including doctors, nurses, and ASHA workers</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTogether, education, police, and health account for most of Bihar’s 2.65 million government employees, far from the tens of millions implied by the manifesto.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBesides this, there is Panchayati Raj Department, under which 8053 Gram Panchayats, 533 Panchayat Samitis, and 38 Zila Parishads together employ thousands, with 942 Junior Engineers and several thousand others recruited through the BSSC.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhere could the promised jobs come from?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut if we were to assume that Tejashwi's promise does get fulfilled, where would the jobs be created? If implemented, the jobs could, in theory, come from multiple channels like direct state recruitment in education, healthcare, local administration, and public works. Yet Bihar’s sanctioned strength and vacancies suggest limited capacity without major restructuring.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBihar has identified food processing, IT/ITES, textiles, and dairy as priority sectors, but historically, turning such investments into millions of formal jobs has proven extremely difficult.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tStructural and social constraints</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBeyond the fiscal math, social realities further narrow feasibility. According to the 2023 caste survey, educational capacity further narrows the eligible pool. While Bihar’s overall literacy rate is 79.7 per cent, only 9.2 per cent have completed higher secondary education, and 7.46 per cent hold a graduate or higher degree. Among marginalised groups, the share is even lower at 3.44 per cent for SCs, 4.95 per cent for EBCs, and 3.87 per cent for STs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, most government posts demand at least matriculation, and clerical or technical roles often require graduation or professional training. At current education levels, only about one in four households may even have a member eligible for recruitment without large-scale skilling efforts.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the fiscal side, Bihar’s own-tax revenue stands at 5.4 per cent of GSDP, well below the levels of states with stronger tax bases. It contributes less than 1 per cent of India’s total income-tax collections and has one of the country’s lowest credit–deposit ratios, signalling weak private investment. Expanding government rolls without matching infrastructure like schools, hospitals, or offices could result in underutilised staff and falling service quality.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe bottom line</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe numbers make the arithmetic clear: a government job for every family would transform Bihar’s fiscal and labour landscape beyond recognition. Whether parties redefine “government job” to include contractual or time-bound roles, or stagger implementation over years, will determine how much of this pledge can move from political rhetoric to administrative reality.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor now, the data make one thing clear -- the scale of the government job promise dwarfs Bihar’s financial and structural capacity.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue to take a measured approach in developing its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), prioritising careful assessment over speed, even as it maintains a firm position against private cryptocurrencies, Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said on Thursday (October 30) at <em>Business Standard’s</em> annual <strong>BFSI Summit</strong> in Mumbai.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tResponding to a question on the pace of CBDC adoption, Sankar said India was technologically and operationally prepared to expand its digital currency pilots but would refrain from rushing into a full-scale launch. “Many countries are experimenting with CBDC. We do not want to rush or launch it full scale because everyone globally is just starting off. The use cases are still very different and limited,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe deputy governor emphasised that central banks worldwide were still analysing the broader macroeconomic and policy implications of CBDCs. “Everyone is waiting to see the impact of CBDC on the economy, so they can calibrate it with their policies. From the start, we have been saying we are in no hurry. Tech-wise, use case, programmability, we are by and large ready,” Sankar said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCross-border payments and CBDC’s potential</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankar highlighted cross-border payments as a key area where CBDCs could have a transformative effect. “In the cross-border space, there is absolutely no improvement as such. It still takes four to five days for settlement and five to six per cent cost of transaction. To solve this problem, we believe CBDC is the answer,” he noted.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCBDCs, he added, have “certain unique use cases where bank money can’t solve the problem of transactions.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tRBI reiterates tough stance on cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn cryptocurrencies, Sankar reiterated the RBI’s longstanding view that private digital tokens serve no useful purpose and pose systemic risks, especially for emerging economies. “Our stance on crypto is decided entirely by the way we have analysed and looked at the basic character of cryptos and the purpose they can serve,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Sankar, unbacked cryptocurrencies “have no underlying cash flow, no issuer, therefore no value” and cannot be considered financial assets. On stablecoins, which are backed by underlying reserves, he warned of risks to monetary sovereignty. “Stablecoins carry a huge risk of replacing your currency and policy sovereignty. They do not serve a purpose that can’t be done better with CBDC,” he said, adding that their introduction “will create a lot of policy concerns.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tRupee internationalisation and capital liberalisation</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDrawing a parallel between CBDC development and the internationalisation of the rupee, Sankar said both were long-term strategic goals requiring patient execution. “We want to be a developed country in a very short time. Can you imagine a developed country when your currency is not commonly acceptable for global cross-border trades? We have to build those things now. We have to start the processes now,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There is no element of panic,” he said when asked about the pace of liberalisation in external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and foreign exchange transactions. “Capital account convertibility is a process, not an event. In this spirit, we have been gradually liberalising capital accounts. Most of inward capital flows are by and large liberalised. What remains under control is what goes out.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankar said the RBI’s upcoming proposals on ECBs aim to allow broader access to overseas borrowing while linking limits to leverage ratios instead of blanket cost caps. “Earlier, only financially strong entities could go out and borrow. That affects the cost for everyone else if one of them fails. To address that risk, we are trying to link the amount you can borrow abroad to your leverage. Once we have it, we don’t need to see a cost cap,” he said, adding that a new framework could be announced “in the next couple of months.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMultiple currencies for a stable global system</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that a diversified global monetary system where multiple currencies are used in trade would help reduce global instability. “Many crises happen because of overdependence on one or two currencies. Multiple currencies can ensure a more stable global financial system,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tPayments innovation and regulatory balance</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSankar also touched on payments innovation and foreign exchange management, noting that the RBI’s intervention on two-factor authentication was intended as guidance rather than regulation. “Technology evolves, so authentication must also evolve. We said you don’t need to rely only on OTP; you can evolve new factors,” he said.</div></div>",

According to <em>The Guardian</em>, leaked documents reveal that the deal included an extraordinary request from Israel: to use a coded “winking mechanism” to secretly notify officials whenever the companies complied with foreign legal demands for Israeli data.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tSecret alert system for data transfers</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe documents show that the Israeli government wanted the companies to embed hidden signals into payment transactions as covert alerts when data was shared with foreign law enforcement. The system was designed to bypass gag orders that legally prevented the companies from naming the countries involved.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLike other cloud providers, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) regularly cooperate with law enforcement agencies worldwide, providing customer data for investigations. Such exchanges are typically confidential, restricted by court or agency-imposed secrecy rules.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tGoogle, Amazon agreed to Israel’s terms</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBoth Google and Amazon reportedly accepted the “winking mechanism” condition to secure the lucrative Nimbus deal. Israel had long feared losing control over sensitive national data to foreign jurisdictions, prompting officials to mandate this coded system.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAn investigation by <em>The Guardian</em>, in collaboration with Israeli-Palestinian outlet +972 Magazine and Local Call, revealed that the companies accepted “strict and unusual controls” imposed by Israel. However, both firms have denied violating any international legal obligations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tHow the ‘winking mechanism’ worked</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe leaked final version of the Nimbus agreement outlines that the code would take the form of “special compensation” payments to Israel within 24 hours of a data transfer. Each payment corresponded to the telephone dialling code of the requesting foreign country — ranging from 1,000 to 9,999 shekels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor example:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf US authorities requested data, the companies would pay 1,000 shekels (for +1).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor Italy (+39), they would transfer 3,900 shekels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf no hint could legally be given about the country, a flat payment of 100,000 shekels (about $30,000) was to be made.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe Nimbus agreement: Israel’s data sovereignty project</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNamed after towering cloud formations, Project Nimbus is a cornerstone of Israel’s cloud modernisation strategy. It aims to migrate public sector and military data into privately operated data centres within Israel.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe seven-year deal, with an option for renewal, bars Google and Amazon from limiting or revoking Israeli access to their cloud infrastructure, even if the government’s actions conflict with company policies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOfficials inserted such clauses fearing that the companies might withdraw services under employee or shareholder pressure, especially over alleged human rights violations in Palestinian territories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tSafeguards against foreign and corporate interference</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsraeli officials also feared potential vulnerabilities to foreign legal actions tied to how their data or AI systems were used during military operations in the West Bank or Gaza.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Nimbus contract thus prevents unilateral suspension of services, a clause that gained renewed attention after Microsoft recently cut off an Israeli military system used for surveillance of Palestinian communications.
