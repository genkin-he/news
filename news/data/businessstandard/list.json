            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe insurance and pension laws are “joined at the hip”, and the Centre’s move to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the insurance sector could also pave the way for global pension fund managers to enter the market without joint venture partners, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Chairperson <strong>S Ramann</strong> said in a fireside chat with <em>Vikas Dhoot</em>. The regulator is also considering an idea to permit smaller pension fund houses, on the lines of small finance banks regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. Edited excerpts:<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>How do we scale up India’s pension coverage?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe National Pension System (NPS) has delivered an average annual return of 9.2 per cent over 15 years, but participation remains skewed. About 75 per cent of total NPS assets are from government subscribers and 25 per cent from others. We perhaps need to reverse that. The goal should be to raise non-government NPS members from 10 million to 250–300 million in the next five to six years using various digital platforms. We need more funds as well, particularly to reach out to Tier-II and Tier-III cities.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have large co-operatives, areas where there is greater wealth, micro, small, and medium enterprise clusters, and lots of workers. We never know where that demand comes from, and we need not just stick to the existing structure of a pension fund that requires ₹50 crore of capital. Can we not look at having a small pension fund, if I could take a leaf out of small finance banks?<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWe need to leverage the fact that we’ve got the best payment system in the world. So why are we not able to bring in more people as distributors who are probably not regulated entities as we demand today? We just need to ensure we are testing for the data flow and ensuring there are no leaks anywhere.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Even before the Association of Mutual Funds in India launched the popular ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ campaign, PFRDA had launched the ‘NPS Zaroori Hai’ campaign. Is there something in the works to spread the pension message further?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThis issue cuts across financial products. Financial literacy is the bedrock for a lot of buying of financial products, and we still need to get that literacy going in vast numbers in a lot of regions. We are so urban-focused today that we’ve forgotten what it is to be able to do a small business in a reasonably small town. I can assure you there is such a high aspiration among those people to grow their wealth and get their children better educated. We need to have financial planners cutting across the sort of turf between mutual funds (MFs), insurance, and pensions, and have the large number of persons who are already there as a distribution workforce ensure we have a minimum certification programme for each product and make that into a viable business. We really have to look at literacy going down to the grassroots. The regulators should be putting their effort behind this entire literacy campaign to reach the right audience with the right content.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The multiplicity of pension products under different regulatory domains is an issue. The insurance industry offers ‘retirement’ products, including annuities. A few MF schemes are called retirement benefit plans. There is, of course, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Is there a need for some cohesion in the way these products are regulated, maybe through a dialogue with other regulators?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThat dialogue is actually happening. There is a regulatory forum for pensions, which has already been instituted. But I think the larger issue is that we have had financial products emerge over the past 150 years, and each one has come in for a particular purpose and has served that purpose very well. I would say that given the need for all these products, we need to have a simple definition which everybody adheres to. So, in order to reduce the possibility of mis-selling, what does a pension product mean? According to us, it is at least 15 years of being invested in a particular product and saving towards that.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have something called a reasonable corpus that builds up with the power of compounding, but at the end of that, today, the law says that you have to forcibly put it into an annuity. Now, an annuity is a very good product, but given the fact that it has to deal with the uncertainty of life, anyone who has designed that product will ensure that there is enough capital buffer and a solvency ratio to ensure that you are in a position to meet the longevity risk as and when it happens. So we have to provide alternatives in terms of the pension payout product. That is why PFRDA has issued a consultation paper looking at the possibility of whether we can add something further with annuity. I think the job really is for the regulator to put across a set of products, and finally, it is for each customer to choose what is suitable for them.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The late finance minister Arun Jaitley had alluded to an idea in one of his Budget speeches that an Indian employee should have a choice between the EPFO and the NPS. Could this new forum examine this?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe EPF is a provident fund which has an accumulation stage. A pension has both an accumulation and a payout stage. The EPF is there for good reason, because there was nothing else in this country. The pension sliver started in 1995. Unfortunately, it was targeted to everybody and not just those below the threshold of income for EPF coverage. So, going forward, as part of the regulators’ forum, we are talking about how these pension products could come under a single regulatory umbrella.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEPF and Public Provident Fund are in a particular genre and we should let them remain. It is for the customers, given their tax profile, to assess which products they should put their money in. The return on the EPF corpus may be a tad below what the NPS has got, but it’s also a very good rate of return. So we should have competing products. And that level of competition really is what we should be looking forward to.</div></div>",

It was a daunting total, built on dominance — but India had other plans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<div>\n<strong>Rodrigues rises as India’s new hero</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia’s pursuit of the record target began cautiously. Shafali Verma opened with intent, cracking Kim Garth through the covers for a crisp boundary in the second over, but her stay was short-lived as she was trapped leg before off the very next ball.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSmriti Mandhana, the leading run-scorer of the tournament before the semifinals, too fell early — edging a leg-side delivery to the wicketkeeper for 24. That left India wobbling at 59 for two, with Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur tasked with rebuilding the innings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe pair steadied the ship with composure and precision. Rodrigues was the more enterprising of the two, reaching her half-century in 57 balls with a boundary off Alana King in the 21st over. Kaur, who had scored 70 against England earlier in the tournament, adopted a more measured approach, bringing up her 22nd ODI fifty off 65 deliveries as India reached 189 for two after 30 overs — still 150 short of the target.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe tension lifted when wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy dropped Rodrigues off King, a miss that proved costly. On the very next delivery, Kaur cut King past point to raise the 150-run stand, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAustralia fought back briefly, with King and Sutherland tightening the screws. Kaur’s dismissal — a lofted shot brilliantly caught by Ashleigh Gardner off Sutherland — broke the partnership at 226 in the 36th over.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDeepti Sharma’s brisk 24 kept the momentum alive before she was run out with nine overs remaining. Rodrigues, meanwhile, powered ahead, completing her third ODI century off 115 balls — a masterclass laced with ten fours. She enjoyed a slice of fortune on 106 when Tahlia McGrath dropped a straightforward catch, but by then, India had seized full control.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRicha Ghosh’s cameo of 26 from 16 deliveries further eased the chase, though her late dismissal added a brief flicker of tension. With 29 needed off the last four overs, Rodrigues remained unflappable, threading three more boundaries in quick succession.

This surge — driven by economic expansion and a shift towards financialisation — is transforming the wealth management landscape, making services more accessible and technology-driven, echoed most panellists during a discussion with Samie Modak of <em>Business Standard</em>.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tAnas Rahman Junaid, founder and chief researcher at Hurun India, said, “From a wealth creation standpoint, India is now on steroids.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by $1 trillion over the last four years and is expected to rise by another $2 trillion by 2030.

We have a massive runway ahead,” he said, adding that HNI and UHNI populations are growing at around 8–9 per cent annually.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRahul Jain, president and head of Nuvama Wealth, noted that over the past decade, India’s wealthy have gradually shifted from traditional assets, such as real estate and gold, to financial investments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Younger investors led the initial move into equities and mutual funds. In recent years, older generations have also turned to professional wealth management — often after monetising real estate assets — to diversify their portfolios,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Saluja, mature investors with experience across multiple market cycles are maintaining discipline amid volatility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“While equity remains the core holding, investors are seeking returns from fixed income, gold, and silver during periods of market consolidation,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAllocations are also diversifying into alternatives, such as private credit, real estate investment trusts (Reits), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), and pre-IPO private equities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJain said investor sentiment is split — one group remains bullish on equities post-consolidation, while another prefers stability through fixed income and gold after subdued equity returns.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTechnology is emerging as a key enabler in broadening access to sophisticated products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSrikanth Subramanian, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Ionic Wealth, said, “We aim to make investment opportunities — once limited to the ultra-rich — accessible to a wider audience. It would be through technology, regulation, and fractionalisation, including tokenised or blockchain-based structures.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, panellists added that human relationships remain at the heart of wealth management.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“HNIs and UHNIs still prefer personalised advice. Technology should enhance, not replace, that touch,” Saluja said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWealth managers and panellists agreed to play a vital role in guiding long-term discipline and strategy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The real value now lies in helping clients stay committed to asset allocation and compounding over time rather than chasing products,” said Jain.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs the industry becomes more competitive and transparent, firms are under pressure to justify their fees and performance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSubramanian noted that wealth managers are being driven towards outcome-based advice and full fee transparency.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSaluja added that professional standards must evolve. “Introducing certification requirements and accountability for relationship managers is essential to ensure client trust and industry credibility,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJunaid highlighted that India’s wealth creation is no longer confined to major cities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In 2015, only 25 non-metro towns featured ultra-rich individuals. That number has now grown to 113. The count of individuals with net worth above ₹1,000 crore outside metros has risen from 87 to 755. Their combined wealth is more than double from ₹7 trillion to ₹16 trillion,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that much of this new wealth is coming from sectors such as industrial products, construction, engineering, and local real estate. This reflects the rise in regional entrepreneurship and manufacturing, he said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAfter witnessing quarters marked by liquidity stress, rising delinquencies, and slowing disbursements, India’s microfinance industry appears to be showing early signs of revival, said leaders and analysts during a panel discussion on the micro lending sector at the <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Summit.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn conversation with <em>Manojit Saha</em> of <em>Business Standard</em>, industry experts said that the worst may be behind the microfinance institutions (MFIs), but the full recovery hinges on improved liquidity support from banks and the government.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Now the situation is better. We have requested the government to institute a larger guarantee fund of say ₹20,000 crores, which will kick-start the virtuous cycle of funding, giving confidence to the bank,” said Alok Misra, CEO, Microfinance Industry Network (MFIN).<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“So, that is under active consideration, we hope that can be expedited, and if that happens, things will get better. It is already normal, the momentum will be sustained,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSadaf Sayeed, CEO, Muthoot Microfin said that disbursements have improved, affordability of rural households has gone up, and collections also improved.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I think the inflation has gone down and the crop has been really good, with rains being good. Due to which prices of vegetables or crops have also gone down, increasing the affordability of the rural household. Personally, we are witnessing better collections and better disbursements. Therefore, the trend is towards the positive,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHP Singh, CMD, Satin Creditcare said that his firm will open 400 branches, indicating that stress in the microfinance segment was coming down.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“When we say 400 branches, opening at this particular juncture means that the things have come back to normal, means that the growth is coming back. We are hopeful that we will get the credit guarantee scheme as discussed in the panel. Portfolio at risk of 120-180 days has gone down significantly,” Singh said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndustry players pointed out that the lack of liquidity remains the biggest constraint for NBFC-MFIs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“For us, the raw material is money. We do not have the liberty to take deposits like banks. The moment liquidity tightens, our growth stops,” said Singh, noting that many banks have slowed lending to the sector due to risk concerns.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSayeed also said that many smaller MFIs are struggling to raise funds, creating a vicious cycle where reduced lending affects borrower cash flows, leading to higher delinquencies. He added that most players are now focusing on portfolio quality rather than aggressive expansion.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn removal of the lending rate cap by the Reserve Bank of India a few years ago, Mishra said that the removal did not cause any pricing or discipline-related issues. “When deregulation happened in 2022, the average weighted lending rate for NBFC-MFIs was around 24 per cent. Today, it stands at 23.62 per cent.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that NBFC-MFIs contribute to only 35 per cent of the microfinance market, while banks and small finance banks -- which operated without interest caps -- dominate the remaining share.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“It’s far-fetched to say removing caps for just 35 per cent of the market led to problems,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMishra said that despite the freedom to price loans, profitability in the sector remains modest, with an average return on equity of about 0.8 per cent and return on assets of 1.8 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSayeed said globally too, Indian MFIs are among the most affordable.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“In Latin America, rates are around 49-50 per cent. Despite not having access to deposits, Indian MFIs charge much less. RBI’s framework, linking rates to cost of funds, credit cost, operating cost, plus a reasonable margin, ensures fair pricing,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSayeed attributed the current contraction in the overall NBFC-MFI portfolio to multiple factors -- higher perceived risks, localised delinquencies due to floods or elections, and reduced fund flows.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Smaller MFIs are struggling to raise funds. When disbursements slow, liquidity at the borrower level also tightens, creating a ripple effect on repayment and demand,” he explained.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn banks developing cold feet in lending to the microfinance segment, Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice president and group head, ICRA, said, “NBFC MFI, it’s a single product company. If you look at a bank, a bank is a multi-product entity. They have the flexibility to move from corporate to retail to infrastructure to agriculture, depending on the flavour of the season and on their risk appetite. Today, they are seeing stress in this portfolio, hence they have slowed down on the disbursements on that side.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn whether MFIs were willing to convert into small finance banks (SFBs), speakers emphasised on sticking to their current area of business.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are happy being focused on MFIs. With the qualifying asset criteria relaxed from 75 per cent to 60 per cent, we have enough flexibility to diversify within the same space,” said Singh. He added that they are best suited to do microfinance.</div></div>",
