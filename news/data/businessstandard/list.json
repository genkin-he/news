Revenue from operations grew 48 per cent YoY at ₹452.47 crore. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) rose 46 per cent YoY at ₹85.78 crore.

The road ahead presents a mix of complexity and promise, shaped by the momentum of the energy transition, expanding global infrastructure, and accelerating digital transformation. These long-term forces are shaping demand across our industry, and TD Power System is strategically positioned to respond. Through focused investments in scale, engineering capabilities, and closer engagement with customers, the company is translating sectoral shifts into meaningful growth, said TD Power Systems in its FY25 annual report.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tData centre-related demand, in particular, is surging and expected to contribute to a 100 GW spike in US power demand by 2030. The management said the company is gearing up to address this with the development of larger generators in the 40–45 MW range, with deliveries scheduled to begin in fiscal 2026. This will position us well for a massive potential scale-up from fiscal 2027 onwards.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe hydro segment has also remained stable and is expected to grow in next coming years. This is primarily supported by the export and domestic market. This reliability highlights hydro’s role as a steady contributor in a dynamic energy sector.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe market for TD Power Systems Generators in North America, Central America, and South America continues to expand greatly. The current outlook for critical markets such as Oil &amp; Gas, onshore pipelines, fracking, and offshore drilling/production are improving under the new US Administration, which is limiting the barriers for new projects. Opportunities in the steam sector are active, particularly in Latin and South America for applications in sugar/ ethanol, pulp, biomass and waste heat markets, the company said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOverall, the European market grew significantly in FY25 and the trend is expected to continue with a positive growth rate of around 20 per cent in the coming year. Meanwhile, the Turkish market continues to face a significant downturn in local manufacturing projects, primarily due to the ongoing economic slowdown and the Government’s incentive policy favouring locally manufactured power equipment, including generators. This trend remains unchanged, and the outlook remains bleak, the company said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The Home &amp; Personal Care (HPC) segment remained the key driver, growing 8.9 per cent Y-o-Y, supported by a strong double-digit rise in oral care, while healthcare and foods &amp; beverages segments were muted, rising 1.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts attributed the subdued growth to the transitory impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) transition – 66 per cent of Dabur’s portfolio moved to the lower 5 per cent slab – along with delayed winter inventory-loading, which together hit volume growth by 300-400 basis points (bps). The impact was also visible in September and spilled over into early October.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGross and Ebitda margins expanded modestly by 10 and 20 bps Y-o-Y to 49.4 per cent and 18.4 per cent, respectively, aided by price hikes, cost optimisation, and a favourable mix. Management expects margins to remain range-bound in the medium term as GST-led pricing adjustments settle.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, on the bourses, Dabur share price dropped 2.56 per cent to hit an intraday low of ₹488.50 per share. At 12:15 AM, Dabur share price was trading 2.21 per cent lower at ₹490.25. By comparison, BSE Sensex was trading 0.17 per cent lower at 84,261.15 levels.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tInCred Equities: Gradual improvement, Hold retained</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInCred Equities maintained its ‘Hold’ rating with a slightly reduced target price of ₹540 (from ₹545 earlier), citing expectations of gradual improvement in sales momentum from the second half of FY26. The brokerage noted that rural markets continued to outperform urban areas, while the oral care portfolio –  led by Dabur Red and Meswak – outpaced peers such as Colgate and Hindustan Unilever.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInCred said Dabur’s focus on rural distribution expansion and smaller pack sizes will help capture demand from GST rate benefits. The launch of Dabur Ventures, a new ₹500 crore investment platform to fund digital-first consumer brands, was seen as a positive long-term strategic move.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tNuvama: GST benefits, La Niña to aid winter recovery</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama Institutional Equities (Nuvama) retained its ‘Buy’ rating but trimmed its target price to ₹605 from ₹625, after cutting FY26-28 earnings estimates by 2-4 per cent to reflect weak beverages performance. The brokerage said Dabur’s revenue and Ebitda grew 5.4 per cent and 6.5 per cent year-on-year, in line with estimates, with the GST transition causing a ₹100 crore (about 3 per cent) hit to revenue.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama expects a stronger second half supported by a likely La Niña-induced harsh winter, which should boost healthcare and honey demand. It noted that 66 per cent of Dabur’s India portfolio now falls under the 5 per cent GST slab, improving affordability and competitiveness. Rural demand outpaced urban growth by 400–500 bps, it added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal: Downgrade to Neutral on weak execution</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal Financial Services downgraded Dabur from ‘Buy’ to ‘Neutral’ and cut its target price to ₹525 from ₹545, due to persistent execution challenges and muted management commentary for H2. While gross and Ebitda margins were broadly stable, the brokerage said Dabur’s revenue growth has been subdued for two years due to weak rural demand, extended monsoons, and slow channel restocking.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage lowered its valuation multiple from 45x to 40x, saying the expected GST benefits and winter portfolio recovery may not immediately translate into strong growth. “Dabur’s consistent weak execution is limiting our confidence in its growth recovery despite macros turning positive,” it said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tJM Financial: Inline results; Add retained</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJM Financial maintained its ‘Add’ rating with a target price of ₹535, saying the results were largely in line with expectations. It noted Dabur’s domestic FMCG business grew 5.7 per cent, with oral care and skin care leading gains, while international markets like the UK and Turkey performed well. Nepal, however, saw a 15 per cent decline due to political disruptions.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage said management’s conservative guidance of mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth in H2FY26 looks achievable, helped by GST rationalisation, expected colder weather, and steady rural demand. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Steady recovery in domestic sales will be key for rerating from current levels,” JM Financial analysts said, adding that valuations have already corrected below long-term averages.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tDabur: Cautious outlook</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile all  brokerages acknowledged stable margins and market share gains in key segments, the consensus pointed to limited near-term triggers. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost expect demand recovery to accelerate in the second half, supported by GST-led price adjustments, improving rural sentiment, and seasonal strength in health and wellness products. However, with target prices revised downward to and a split in rating, the <em>Street</em> sentiment on Dabur remains mixed.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

In August, President Donald Trump announced a steep 50 per cent tariffs on India to punish it for its purchase of Russian oil and US authorities began a new anti-dumping probe on modules from India, Indonesia and Laos.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe manufacturer is betting on a little-known 2012 US customs ruling that deems solar panels to have been made in the country where the cells come from. Paithankar is confident that “if you configure your supply chain well,” the high tariffs currently in place on Indian goods can be sidestepped. “We are continuing to service our US orders,” he said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US launched a separate investigation on Waaree for possible duty evasion in September. At the time, the company said it was cooperating with the ongoing investigation and was abiding “by all applicable local laws and regulations in every country that it operates.” Paithankar declined to comment further.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWaaree’s order book was for 24 gigawatts at the end of September, worth about ₹47,000 crore ($5.3 billion). The US accounts for nearly 60 per cent of that. The company plans to make those panels at its Indian plants, as well as its US facilities where operations are expanding.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWaaree is on course to double capacity at its Houston module plant to 3.2 gigawatts in the next six months and has added about a gigawatt of panel making lines through the acquisition of US assets of Meyer Burger Technology AG.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company has so far invested about $150 million in the US and has plans to expand it eight-fold by potentially adding cell manufacturing and battery storage systems, Paithankar said. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPaithankar said Waaree’s decision to stick with the US is based on fundamentals. The artificial intelligence boom, electrification of transport and “reshoring” of manufacturing are fueling massive demand for power in the US, with renewables being the most cost-effective source, he said. </div></div>",

While hypothyroidism (a sluggish thyroid) can slow metabolism and add a few kilos, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) can cause weight loss.

Thyroid medication controls the condition and not cure it. Stopping treatment abruptly can make symptoms worse or cause a hormonal crash. Always speak to your doctor before changing or stopping any thyroid therapy, he advised.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will iodine supplements cure thyroid problems?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Taking iodine supplements cures thyroid problems</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to Dr Majhi, most people already get enough iodine through their diet and <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/salt-myths-fact-check-daily-sodium-health-risks-125100300020_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">iodised salt</a>. He cautions that too much iodine can actually worsen conditions like Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. Supplements are not a cure and can backfire.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do all thyroid nodules mean cancer?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>All thyroid nodules mean <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/women-cancer-detection-gap-lancet-study-125102300345_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">cancer</a></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Over 90 per cent of thyroid nodules are non-cancerous. Still, every lump deserves attention. The right approach is to get it checked soon. Early detection ensures peace of mind and, if needed, early treatment.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does thyroid disease always show visible swelling?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease always shows visible swelling or a neck bulge</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>The thyroid does not always make itself known. Many thyroid disorders are “silent”, with vague signs like fatigue, dry skin, or irregular periods. Blood tests and scans are the only reliable ways to confirm what’s going on under the skin.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can herbal supplements replace thyroid medication?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Natural or herbal supplements can replace thyroid medication</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>“No herbal remedy or “detox” has been scientifically proven to replace prescribed thyroid hormones. In fact, some supplements can interfere with medication or even cause side effects if taken unsupervised,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can thyroid disease make pregnancy impossible?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease makes pregnancy impossible</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Dr Majhi says that most women with thyroid disorders can conceive and have healthy pregnancies, provided they are properly treated and monitored. The key is regular hormone checks and medical supervision.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Is it impossible to lose weight with hypothyroidism?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You can’t lose weight if you have hypothyroidism</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Weight loss might be slower, but it is possible. Once thyroid levels are stabilised, a balanced diet, protein intake, and regular exercise work as effectively as they do for anyone else. “Blaming every stubborn kilo on the thyroid is an easy trap,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Are thyroid disorders rare in India?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disorders are rare</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>India is one of the global hotspots for thyroid disease. Recent data suggest that self-reported thyroid disorders among Indians aged 15–49 years rose to 2.9 per cent in 2019–21 (National Family Health Survey-V). Other smaller studies suggest a broader prevalence of 10–12 per cent or higher in adult populations. However, deficits in national biomarker surveys mean the true figure may be higher. Because symptoms often mimic other issues, millions remain undiagnosed, silently dealing with fatigue and mood swings they can’t explain.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will cutting out gluten cure thyroid disease?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Cutting out gluten will cure thyroid disease</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Unless you have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet helps thyroid health. It can help some autoimmune thyroid patients, but for most, it’s unnecessary and nutritionally restrictive.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does a normal TSH mean your thyroid is fine?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>If your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, your thyroid is perfectly fine</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/health-checks-for-mothers-over-40-tests-to-preventive-care-guide-125060900286_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">TSH</a> is just one piece of the puzzle. Dr Majhi says that for a full picture, doctors also look at Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibodies. A normal TSH does not always mean everything is in balance, especially if you are still feeling off.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do thyroid medicines make you dependent?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Once you start medication, you will become dependent</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to the doctors, medicines like Levothyroxine aren’t addictive and simply replace what your body can’t make. It doesn’t fix the root cause, but it keeps your metabolism and hormones stable.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can apple cider vinegar or turmeric cure thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Home remedies like apple cider vinegar or turmeric can fix thyroid issues</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>While these may support general wellness, they can’t balance thyroid hormones. They might help digestion or inflammation, but they’re no match for medical therapy. Use them as lifestyle support, not substitutes.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Should you avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You must avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Quite the opposite! Dr Majhi says exercise actually helps stabilise metabolism, improve mood, and manage weight. Unless your thyroid levels are severely uncontrolled, movement is medicine. Just tailor the intensity under your doctor’s guidance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Majhi stresses that thyroid disorders are common, treatable, and misunderstood. What makes them tricky is how they usually mimic everyday fatigue or stress. That is why periodic screening and trusted medical advice matter more than social media “cures.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The thyroid gland may be small, but its impact on overall health is enormous.
