We always see H2 (in terms of FY26) performance-wise quite tilted towards being 30 to 40 per cent better than H1. We will see higher volumes in H2, and typically with higher volumes and longer run hours, you have less expenditure for shutdown and other one-time expenditures that go into the plant, which results in a lower cost of operation.

The regulator has expanded the scope of strategic investors in REITs and InvITs, reclassified REITs as equity for mutual fund investments, and introduced put options in non-convertible securities to enhance liquidity.

We are working on those. We have simplified and digitised FPI registration.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India has one of the largest primary markets, but you recently reduced the size of a minimum public offer (MPO) in an IPO and the minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirement for listed companies. Is there a disconnect?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLet me clarify: We have not diluted the norms on MPS. MPS remains at 25 per cent — unchanged. What we examined was the MPO and the time allowed for companies to achieve MPS.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe markets have expanded. After the IPO of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), we began discussing companies with a ₹6 trillion market cap coming to the market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStrict timelines on MPS can act like a Damocles’ sword, potentially hurting minority shareholders due to price volatility. So, we took a realistic view of what the market can absorb. After extensive consultations and excellent feedback, we introduced multiple pathways to achieving compliance on MPS and MPO, without compromising on investor protection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>MFs enjoy a tax advantage over portfolio management services and alternative investment funds. That's one side of the story. On the other hand, while the Reserve Bank of India is paving the way for banks to lend more to earn more interest income, Sebi is limiting the sources of MF income. Yes, I am referring to the new discussion paper on the expense ratio ...</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs are critical for retail participation. We have 56 million unique investors. The industry has grown rapidly but is still 20-25 per cent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP). In advanced economies, MFs’ assets under management are 80-85 per cent of GDP.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMFs must grow faster because they provide a safer way for retail investors to enter the market and promote long-term investing. Their tax status is aligned with that structure — it is a pass-through model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MF industry has grown significantly and become more professional. We cannot constrain it. That is why we introduced options like specialised investment funds and other reforms, allowing more activities with appropriate risk segregation. Simplifying regulations has been a key objective. Some proposals on the fee structure stem from the need for greater clarity, fairness, and transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi research shows 90-93 per cent of individual investors lose money in F&amp;Os. There has been so much discussion on easing out weekly F&amp;Os. When will we see that?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a sensitive subject and requires thoughtful handling. We adopted a calibrated approach and implemented a series of measures to improve the market after five rounds of consultation. Initially, we received diverse views, which we reconciled.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome measures have taken effect; others will kick in as late as December 1. Some began in October, some in July, and more are scheduled for May 2026. We have introduced guardrails — limiting expiries to only two days a week and one index per day — to curb irrational exuberance among retail investors less aware of the workings of the market. Statutory warnings have also been included on the trading screen.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the same time, many market participants actively use derivatives products. We cannot abruptly shut down the market. Therefore, any further steps will be released for public consultation. Stakeholders can evaluate the data and provide feedback before we proceed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will the IPO of the National Stock Exchange see the light of day during your tenure?</strong></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> Of course, unless you want my tenure to be very short.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Can you take us through Sebi’s “30-second cyber-security check”?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is an important initiative by Sebi. With support from market participants, banks, and others, we have developed a unique system — the first of its kind globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia is a global leader in Unified Payments Interface and digital public infrastructure. With 45-50 per cent of the world’s digital transactions happening in India, convenience is high, but that also enables fraudsters. Our objective is to end the ease of doing fraud. We must protect millions of investors at scale.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMany people spend time choosing vegetables or comparing products, but not even 30 seconds checking if their securities account is secure. The “30-Second Check” on Sebi’s Saarthi app enables users to quickly verify bank-account linkage, demat-account security, MF statements, the validity of the advisor or intermediary, and whether any unauthorised transfer or pledge has taken place.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is a systemic, preventive effort — unique globally. The aim is for current and potential investors to be aware so that they do not lose money. Market risk is understood — but fraud risk must be avoided.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the latest on finfluencers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe are doing around 5,000 takedowns every month, and have taken down over 100,000 pieces of content from platforms with support from Google, Meta, and others. With better tools and platforms deploying artificial intelligence more effectively, we should be able to act even more forcefully.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sebi has gained more teeth over the years. Do you need additional powers?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe have adequate powers. We must use them judiciously, sensibly, and consistently. We also need to keep upgrading our surveillance tools — which we are doing. If we have done well, we must do even better. If we keep exercising these powers responsibly, we will continue to maintain public trust in the capital markets — because as a watchdog, that is our duty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You recently launched an e-office in Sebi. Is that correct?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat’s correct. Sebi was, I admit, late in adopting it. This will strengthen efficiency in the organisation. I can say we are fortunate to have some of the finest minds at Sebi.</div></div>",
