After 20 unforgettable years on tour, however, it’s time... I’m officially hanging up my racquet.

Representing India has been the greatest honour of my life. Every serve, every point, every match, I played for that flag, for that feeling, for my country.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he may be stepping away from competition, Bopanna emphasized that his association with tennis will continue:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This isn’t goodbye. It’s a thank you, to everyone who shaped, guided, and supported me. I want to give back to the game and help young dreamers believe that their beginnings don’t define their limits.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom the coffee plantations of Coorg to the grand stages of Paris, Rohan Bopanna’s journey has been one of resilience, humility, and excellence — a legacy that will inspire generations to come.</div></div>",

This was compared to the previous high of 20.008 billion transactions in August this year and the highest value of Rs 25.14 trillion in May. In September, this was 19.63 billion in volume and Rs 24.9 trillion in value. This is the best-ever month, after UPI became operational in April 2016, witnessing 668 million daily transactions valued at Rs 87,993 crore.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This festival season, UPI has been a key driver of convenience and commerce, from small purchases to larger business payments and supporting both consumers and local merchants. Bharat is now driving this momentum, with local retailers and assisted digital networks helping new users transact confidently. As credit on UPI and interoperable services evolve, India is steadily moving towards a truly inclusive and accessible digital economy,\" said Anand Kumar Bajaj, founder, managing director, and chief executive officer, PayNearby.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"The steady growth of 25 per cent in transaction volume and 16 per cent in value year-on-year shows how UPI continues to enable easy, secure payments across communities,\" he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tImmediate Payment Service (IMPS) for the month was also up by 3 per cent to 404 million in October, up from 394 million in September this year. Interestingly, August numbers had touched 477 million.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn value, it was up 8 per cent to Rs 6.42 trillion versus Rs 5.98 trillion in September. In August, this was Rs 6.31 trillion for 488 million transactions. The number of daily transactions dipped to 13.02 million this month against 13.15 million in September. The number of daily transactions in value was up 4 per cent to Rs 20,709 crore from Rs 19,895 crore last month. The volume was down by 14 per cent, while value was up by 2 per cent versus October 2024.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFASTag transactions in October were up 8 per cent to 361 million from 333 million in September. This was 371 million in August. Value was also up 4 per cent to Rs 6,686 crore from Rs 6,421 crore in September, landing closer to the August value of Rs 6,661 crore. Average daily transactions also increased to 11.64 million with a value of Rs 216 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn October, Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) transactions stood at 112 million, up 6 per cent from 106 million in September. The value of transactions was Rs 30,509 crore against Rs 27,388 crore the previous month. In August, volume was at 103 million with value at Rs 32,329 crore. The number of daily transactions came up to 3.6 million from 3.55 million during the last month, bringing the value to Rs 984 crore from Rs 913 crore last month.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

The LVM3 gives India self-reliance in launching heavy satellites, which earlier had to be sent on foreign rockets.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Key features of LVM3</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tHeight: 43.5 metres</div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tVehicle diameter: 4.0 metres</div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tHeat shield diameter: 5.0 metres</div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNumber of stages: 3</div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLift-off mass: 640 tonnes</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the rocket carrying?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rocket will carry the CMS-03 satellite, which weighs about 4,410 kg and will be placed in a GTO. Once in orbit, CMS-03 will provide multi-band communication services over a wide region that includes the Indian landmass and nearby ocean areas.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe CMS-03 satellite is designed to improve telecom, television broadcasting, and broadband services across India and its surrounding oceans. It will replace older satellites and help strengthen connectivity for remote regions, ships, and aircraft over the Indian Ocean.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How does the rocket work?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rocket works in three stages. In the first stage, two giant boosters called S200 solid boosters fire up together to lift the rocket off the ground. These boosters are packed with solid fuel that burns very quickly, producing a strong thrust to overcome the earth’s gravity. They burn for about 134 seconds (a little over two minutes) before separating and falling away once their fuel is used up.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the second stage, known as the L110 liquid core stage, the main liquid engine starts working while the solid boosters are still burning — about 113 seconds into the flight. It uses liquid fuel, which allows more precise control over the rocket’s movement. As the rocket climbs higher, about 115 km above the earth, the payload fairing (the top cover that protects the satellite during launch) opens and drops off since there’s no more air resistance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFinally, the third stage, called the C25 cryogenic stage, takes over after the liquid stage completes its job at around 313 seconds. “Cryogenic” means it runs on super-cold fuel stored at extremely low temperatures. This stage gives the final, powerful push needed to place the satellite into space. It continues burning until the satellite reaches its target — the GTO, a very high orbit roughly 36,000 km above the earth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why is the launch important?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIf the launch is successful, it will become the heaviest satellite ever launched from the Indian soil. It will reaffirm LVM3’s capability to let India launch heavy satellites independently, without depending on foreign launchers. Meanwhile, the CMS-03 will support digital connectivity, disaster management, and secure communication services, marking another major step forward in India’s space journey.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n</div>",
