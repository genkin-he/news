In the year-ago period, net profit had stood at Rs 4,992.87 crore.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe demerger of the hotel business became effective from January 1, 2025, and net profit from continuing operations in Q2FY26 stood at Rs 5,186.55 crore, up 4.2 per cent from Rs 4,979.14 crore in the year-ago period.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nNet profit came in ahead of the Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs 5,080 crore.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe company reported consolidated gross revenue of Rs 21,255.86 crore for Q2FY26, down 1.3 per cent compared to Rs 21,536.38 crore a year ago.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe net revenue at Rs 19,502 crore came in marginally lower than the Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs 19,774 crore. Sequentially, net revenue was down 9.3 per cent, while net profit attributable to owners was down 2.3 per cent.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe company’s board on Thursday recommended former G20 Sherpa and NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant as an independent director for a period of five years with effect from January 1, 2026.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe board also approved the reappointment of Hemant Malik as a whole-time director for a period of two years with effect from August 12, 2026.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe company highlighted a strong operating performance by group companies led by ITC Infotech India Ltd and ITC Hotels Ltd. Subsidiary Surya Nepal Private Ltd delivered resilient performance amid disruptions in Nepal during September 2025, it added.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nRevenue from operating businesses was up except in agri. ITC’s non-cigarette FMCG segment recorded revenue of Rs 6,059.12 crore, up 8.5 per cent Y-o-Y amid operational challenges.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe company said excessive rains in many parts of the country and the transition to the new goods and services tax (GST) regime posed operational challenges, causing short-term business disruptions. Pre-tax profit from the segment stood at Rs 438.72 crore, marginally down from Rs 444.24 crore a year earlier.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nStability in taxes and differentiated and premium offerings boosted the performance of the cigarettes segment, which clocked revenue of Rs 9,414.35 crore, up 6.04 per cent from the year-ago period. Pre-tax profit at Rs 5,462.10 crore was up 4.2 per cent Y-o-Y.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe agri business segment recorded revenue of Rs 4,037.80 crore, down 30.9 per cent Y-o-Y.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe company said that value-added agri exports during the quarter were relatively subdued due to delayed call-offs by customers amid uncertainty on account of US tariffs. Pre-tax profit from the segment, however, was up 1.5 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 453.61 crore.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe operating environment for paperboards, paper, and packaging remained challenging during the quarter, with sustained influx of low-priced supplies into global markets, including India, elevated domestic wood prices, and subdued realisations, the company said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe segment posted revenue of Rs 2,220.32 crore, up 5.02 per cent Y-o-Y. Pre-tax profit at Rs 181.39 crore was, however, down 22.8 per cent.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><br/><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tLupin Digital Health (LDH), a subsidiary of pharma major Lupin, on Thursday announced the launch of VitaLyfe, an AI-powered cardiometabolic wellness platform designed specifically for working professionals aged 25 to 50.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe platform aims to help India’s workforce reclaim heart health by combining artificial intelligence, behavioural science, and computer-vision technology to identify early risks and deliver personalised interventions across nutrition, exercise, and stress management.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>AI and science-led approach to heart health</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Most cardiac conditions are preventable and lifestyle-driven,” said Sidharth Srinivasan, CEO of Lupin Digital Health. “We found that while diabetes awareness has grown thanks to metrics like HbA1c, heart health lacked a clear, measurable parameter. That’s where the concept of heart age comes in.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDeveloped from research published in the British Heart Journal, VitaLyfe’s algorithm calculates a user’s “heart age” using clinical markers such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits, helping users quantify and reduce their “heart age gap.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Corporate-first model for affordable wellness</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAvailable initially through employers, insurers, and brokers, the platform follows a B2B2C model, with corporate health plans serving as the primary entry point. “The need is highest among corporate employees. HR heads are genuinely concerned about young professionals in their 30s and 40s facing sudden cardiac events,” Srinivasan noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEmployers are willing to allocate ₹5,000–₹8,000 per employee for wellness programmes, while VitaLyfe is priced under ₹1,000, making it accessible and scalable.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOnce onboarded, users undergo a “risk stratification” process that translates raw health data into insights such as heart age, gap contributors, and lifestyle risks. The app then sets measurable goals — such as lowering heart age by two years or losing five kilos — and deploys AI-driven interventions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKey features include photo-based meal tracking, camera-guided exercise correction, guided meditation routines, and gamified challenges that encourage team participation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve already tested VitaLyfe with around 5,000 employees in beta, and engagement has been very strong,” Srinivasan said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Backed by Lupin’s clinical and digital expertise</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRajeev Sibal, President, India Region Formulations at Lupin, said, “With VitaLyfe, we are enabling insurers and employers to combine clinical expertise with AI-driven technology to deliver scalable, measurable wellness outcomes for millions of working Indians.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe platform, compliant with India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act and ISO 27001-certified, stores all user data securely within India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Expanding beyond cardiac care into preventive wellness</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor LDH, VitaLyfe marks a strategic expansion beyond post-discharge cardiac care into preventive wellness. The company, which partners with over 50 hospitals, currently derives 60–70 per cent of its revenue from digital therapeutics for cardiac patients.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the immediate focus is adoption, Srinivasan sees significant growth potential. “Look at India’s white-collar workforce and the growing burden of cardiometabolic diseases. The sky’s the limit,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVitaLyfe is expected to gain strong traction as employers renew group insurance plans for 2025. Looking ahead, LDH plans to extend its digital therapeutics model to metabolic disorders and oncology, supported by clinical validation.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We don’t launch anything without scientific evidence,” Srinivasan said. “Preventive wellness is still underinvested in India, but through employers and insurers, we can make it engaging and free for users.”</div></div>",
