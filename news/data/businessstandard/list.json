Since the summer, Ukraine's long-range drone campaign has ramped up dramatically, pounding energy infrastructure across Russia and stretching Moscow's air defences thin.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBuilt from parts made in a scattered network of workshops, these drones now fly much further than at any point in the war.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOfficers in body armour move with quick precision; headlamps glow red to stay hidden. Engines sputter like old motorcycles as exhaust fumes drift into the moonless night. Minutes later, one after another, the drones lift from a makeshift runway and head east. The strikes have caused gasoline shortages in Russia, even forcing rationing in some regions and underscoring a growing vulnerability in the country's infrastructure.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Drones hammer refineries</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWestern analysts say the attacks on energy infrastructure so far have had a serious but not crippling effect. Ukrainian drones have repeatedly hit 16 major Russian refineries, representing about 38 per cent of the country's nominal refining capacity, according to a recent review by the Carnegie Endowment, a US-based think tank.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut it argues the actual impact has been considerably more limited: most plants resumed operations within weeks, and Russia's refining output has been cushioned by idle capacity and existing fuel surpluses.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe deep strikes have, however, given Kyiv the initiative at an important moment. The United States and Europe are ramping up sanctions on Russia's oil industry even as Kyiv's request for US long-range Tomahawk missiles has stalled. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine's improved long-range strike capability is causing real damage forcing the Kremlin to import fuel and curb exports. We believe they've lost up to 20 per cent of their gasoline supply directly as a result of our strikes, he told reporters at a briefing in Kyiv.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAt the secret launch site, the commander overseeing the operation a broad-shouldered man identified by his call sign, Fidel, in accordance with Ukrainian military regulations watches through night-vision goggles as the drones climb into the star-filled sky.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDrones are evolving, Fidel told The Associated Press. Instead of flying 500 kilometers (310 miles), now they fly 1,000 ... Three factors go into a successful operation: the drones, the people and the planning. We want to deliver the best result. For us, this is a holy mission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ukraine thrives on no-frills weapons</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tMuch of Ukraine's fleet is homegrown. The Liutyi, a workhorse of the nightly attacks, is a waist-high craft with a sausage-shaped body, a propeller at the back, and a distinctive triangular tail.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt looks neither sleek nor intimidating more Home Depot than Lockheed Martin but the ease of assembly means it can be kept hidden and constantly tweaked: optimized to slip through heavily monitored frontline airspace.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTypical of Ukraine's no-frills war production philosophy, the Liutyi whose name means fierce in Ukrainian has become a symbol of national pride and recently featured on a local postage stamp.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe reach of these drones with some models doubling in range over the past year to routinely strike targets within a 1,000-kilometer radius of the border marks a shift in the geography of the conflict. Attacks a year ago damaged refineries in a much narrower range, mostly in western Russian border regions. Costs have also come down, further testing expensive air defense systems, with long-range drones now being produced in Ukraine for as little as USD 55,000.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>A shift in conflict geography</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhat we're seeing is that Ukraine is getting better at taking the war inside Russia, said Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at RANE, a global risk analysis firm. For most of the war, Russia operated on the assumption that its own territory was safe. That's no longer the case.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe strategic logic is attrition by logistics, he argued: by forcing Russia to reroute supplies and commit air defences to a wider area, Kyiv seeks to degrade Moscow's capacity to sustain large-scale operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Paris-based International Energy Agency says repeated drone strikes have cut Russia's refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels a day. That's triggered domestic fuel shortages and curbed exports of diesel and jet fuel, even as overall global oil production remains steady and prices stable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tKyiv's homegrown strike capability allows independent drone launches, bypassing the Western approval required for imported long-range weapons. That autonomy preceded tougher sanctions on Russia: allies escalated only after Ukraine had spent months hitting Russian refineries.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the ground, each mission is a study in tradeoffs. Fewer than 30 per cent of drones even reach the target area, so meticulous planning is essential, said Fidel, who reflected on the human cost. War has fallen to our generation so that we can fight for our kids and they can live in a free democratic country, he said. We are currently obtaining experience that will be used by every country in the world, and we are paying the price with our lives and the lives of our friends.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Director, President and Representative Toshihiro Mibe said the automaker is finalising strategies for the Indian market amid changes in the global markets with the emergence of Chinese OEMs.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<p>\r\n\tEven Honda is impacted by this trend and in this kind of situation the company considers North America, Japan, and India as its growth markets.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"India is going to be a priority market, and that's the market where we want to spend more effort going forward. Within Honda, we've initiated a project team, especially for the Indian market, and the project team is working on coming up with the strategy for the Indian market now,\" Mibe said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance, just like Honda's two-wheelers are performing well in the Indian market with a collaborative approach with the Indian suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), there could be similar partnerships for the cars business to maximise its localisation in the country, he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tElaborating further on the plans, Honda Cars India President and CEO Takashi Nakajima said the company has aggressive product plans for the country.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We are planning to launch ten more models in India till 2030. With SUVs becoming mainstream, seven out of the ten models would be catering to that segment,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNakajima announced that it is also gearing up to re-enter the sub 4-meter SUV segment, which is one of the largest verticals volume wise in the overall PV market.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We are considering a wider range of options, products catering to enhance sales volume as well as premium products as well,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese carmaker, currently sells just one SUV model -- Elevate -- in the market with the other two products being Amaze and City sedans.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda plans to produce its next-generation EV Honda 0 Alpha in India and later also utilise the country to export to Japan and some other Asian countries. The model is expected to go on sale in India and Japan in 2027.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe automaker confirmed that it would also consolidate hybrid product range in India. Currently only City sedan has variants featuring the hybrid technology.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe company will have products with multiple powertrains including ICE, hybrid and full electric to cater to varied set of customer requirements in India, it stated.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen asked about market share aspirations, Nakajima said that efforts to streamline the model range in the country has impacted the company's volume and now the focus would be to make Honda stronger in the Indian market.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India has seen its market share dip considerably over the last few years amidst enhanced competition.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAbout expanding production capacity at Tapukara plant in Rajasthan and also possibility of utilising the Greater Noida plant, he noted that nothing is finalised as yet but the automaker is considering various \"options flexibly\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2023, Honda Cars India formally announced closure of manufacturing operations at its Greater Noida facility in Uttar Pradesh.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe automaker said the decision to cease production at the plant, which came up in 1997, has been taken as part of realignment of manufacturing operations with the goal of improving business efficiency.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWith the closure of the Greater Noida facility, HCIL also discontinued CR-V and Civic models in the country. Both the models were being manufactured at the plant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Greater Noida plant had an installed production capacity of one lakh units per annum. On the other hand, Tapukara facility can roll out 1.8 lakh units per year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tReplying to a query on the deployment of flex fuel technologies in its product range, Mibe said Honda has been offering flex fuel vehicles in the Brazilian market for many years and if required can introduce it in India as well.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHonda Cars India registered a cumulative growth of 20 per cent in its total sales with 1,31,871 units sold during calendar year 2024.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDomestic sales of the company stood at 68,650 units and exports at 63,221 units last year.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe maker of City and Amaze sedans and Elevate midsize SUV sold a total of 1,10,143 units in 2023 with domestic volume of 84,289 units.</p><p></p></div>",
