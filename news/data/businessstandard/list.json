Similarly, research at other international institutes is ongoing to develop vaccine candidates.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"However, these are still years away from licensure. On the therapeutic front, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as the most promising option,\" the ICMR document said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe best-studied candidate is m102.4, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the G glycoprotein of the Nipah virus, which prevents viral entry by blocking its interaction with ephrin-B2/B3 receptors, according to the ICMR.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe m102.4 antibody has shown strong protection in animal models and has been found safe in Phase 1 clinical trials, it said. Though definitive human efficacy data are lacking, the antibody has been used under compassionate protocols in Australia and was also made available to Kerala during recent outbreaks, the EoI document stated.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe importance of having monoclonal antibody stocks ready for deployment in India cannot be overstated, the apex health research body said. Given the very high case fatality rate and the absence of licensed vaccines, mAbs represent the only currently feasible biomedical countermeasure, it said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir greatest value lies in post-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk contacts, such as healthcare workers exposed without adequate protection, family members in close contact, or laboratory personnel with accidental exposure. Administered early, they can potentially prevent disease onset, as demonstrated convincingly in animal models.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, in patients presenting early during infection, monoclonal antibodies may offer a therapeutic benefit by reducing viral load and limiting progression, thereby complementing supportive critical care, the document added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMaintaining ready access to such antibodies ensures that India can act swiftly during an outbreak, it said. Pre-positioned stocks, streamlined regulatory and ethical approvals, and defined clinical protocols for prophylaxis and therapeutic use would allow immediate deployment without delays, which often occur when arrangements are attempted in the middle of an outbreak.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This readiness, combined with continued strengthening of surveillance, infection control practices, and One Health investigations of bat reservoirs, will be critical for limiting the impact of Nipah virus outbreaks in the future,\" the document concluded.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Looking ahead, India needs to build its own indigenous medical countermeasures against the Nipah virus, particularly monoclonal antibodies,\" the ICMR said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to move forward through active collaboration with Indian industry partners for developing an indigenous monoclonal antibody platform and manufacturing stock, which will not only ensure timely and reliable access during outbreaks but also strengthen national preparedness for emerging viral threats, it added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ICMR-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, one of the constituent institutes of the Indian Council of Medical Research, has already initiated research and development in this direction, with experimental work at an advanced stage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ICMR-NIV has state-of-the-art laboratory infrastructure, including BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, and the team possesses expertise in outbreak investigations, surveillance, virological and molecular characterisation, vaccine candidate development through virus inactivation and molecular methods, and conducting preclinical trials in suitable animal models.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe institute also specialises in laboratory testing to evaluate antibody and immune responses in clinical trials at different phases (I, II, and III). The infrastructure and resources available at ICMR institutes, as indicated above at ICMR-NIV, will be leveraged for joint research, development, and preclinical studies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the EoI document, the ICMR and its institutes will provide expert guidance and technical support in all phases of research and development for the creation of monoclonal antibodies against Nipah viral disease.</p><p></p></div>",

It ensures the safety of marine animals during their breeding and mating season, said officials, adding that the ban has been clamped in accordance with Sections 2, 7 and 4 of Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act (OMFRA), 1982 and provisions of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ban will be strictly implemented as it is done every year to save turtles, as these endangered species perish in larger numbers either by getting entangled in fishing nets or being hit by fishing trawler propellers, an official said.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAs per the arrangements, a multi-layered patrolling exercise will be done involving the forest, fisheries, and marine police, besides the coast guard personnel.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo ensure effective patrolling, 61 on-shore camps and five off-shore camps have been set up in the state's four wildlife divisions - Bhadrak, Rajnagar, Puri and Berhampur.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe armed police force will flank the forest and fisheries patrolling teams. Five high-speed boats, 13 trawlers and support boats are pressed into service to intercept illegal marine fishing in prohibited zones, said Sudrashan Gopinath Yadav, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (wildlife) Forest Division.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAround 11,000 fishermen families will be affected due to the ban. To compensate for the loss of income avenues, the state government has decided to extend one-time livelihood assistance of Rs 15,000 to the affected fishermen families, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOdisha Traditional Fish Workers Union (OTFWU), an organisation of fishermen, however, demanded that the amount be enhanced to Rs 30,000 and include all families depending on fishing-related works, including small-time fish traders under the scheme.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tK Yellayya, general secretary of the union, said they demand a reduction of the ban period from seven months to five months and from 20 km from the coast to 5 km and provide alternative livelihood support to all affected families, depending on fishing and its related activities<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tThe female turtles virtually invade the nesting beaches usually at the dead of the night for laying eggs, the phenomenon otherwise described as 'Arribada'. After laying eggs, the turtles leave the nesting ground and enter the sea. Hatchlings emerge from these eggs after 45-60 days. It is a rare natural phenomenon where the babies grow without their mother.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",
