Just as mutual funds and insurance became household names, alternatives are following suit.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Jain, the next phase of growth will hinge on domestic capital pools connecting India’s deep savings ecosystem with private equity and venture capital. “Every large economy eventually funds itself domestically. India is reaching that stage,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tMarket-beating returns</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra, partner at Samara Capital, highlighted that private equity has consistently outperformed public markets globally, and India’s story mirrors that trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Globally, PE has outperformed public markets by about 6–7 per cent on a 10-year rolling basis,” he said. “In India, deal flow has picked up sharply. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices are increasing allocations to alternative funds — from 7–8 per cent now to a projected 15–16 per cent.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe identified three pillars driving mainstreaming: fundraising, deal flow, and exits. “We now have vibrant opportunities in growth capital, buyouts, and even secondary exits. IPOs, domestic M&amp;As, SME listings — all of these complete a healthy investment cycle,” Kabra added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExits and buyouts mark a new phase</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tKedaara Capital’s founder and managing partner Kejriwal said India’s “sweet spot” stems from improved exit markets and a cultural shift among family-owned businesses. “Fifteen years ago, India was good at attracting capital but not returning it,” he said. “That’s changed. We’ve had robust IPOs, sponsor-to-sponsor sales, and rising acceptance among business families to sell strategic stakes. Selling is no longer seen as a mark of shame,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuyouts, once rare, now account for half of all private equity deals, noted Gopalakrishnan. “In 2013, buyouts made up just 20 per cent of the market. With succession planning more common and the economy larger, both the pool of opportunities and transaction sizes have risen.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s scale advantage</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India becomes the world’s fifth-largest economy, global investors are paying closer attention. “Private equity works in large and sophisticated economies,” said Gaja Capital’s Jain. “Until recently, India was neither large nor sophisticated enough. That’s changed. We now have the scale, entrepreneurs, and IPO markets to support sustained private equity growth.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKejriwal added that while India remains an “entrepreneurial country of immense depth”, the PE industry is still at the level of a cottage industry. “We’ve barely scratched the surface. The best years are yet to come,” he predicted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAI and the next investment wave</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOn whether artificial intelligence (AI) will reshape investment patterns, Kejriwal struck a cautious tone: “We’re not chasing the AI hype. For us, the focus is on how our portfolio companies adopt AI efficiently, rather than betting on untested products.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKabra echoed the sentiment, saying India’s role in AI will be more about building supportive infrastructure than developing frontier models. “We’re investing in the ecosystem — from data structuring to chip manufacturing — to future-proof our portfolios,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is a constant game of adapting. Our job is to future-proof the businesses we invest in,” said Gopalakrishnan.</div></div>",
