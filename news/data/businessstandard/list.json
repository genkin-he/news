After a brief mid-innings wobble, the middle order rose to the challenge, guiding India to a solid 271. The bowlers complemented the effort beautifully, wrapping up the Sri Lankan innings for 211 with eight balls to spare.

Similarly, research at other international institutes is ongoing to develop vaccine candidates.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"However, these are still years away from licensure. On the therapeutic front, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as the most promising option,\" the ICMR document said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe best-studied candidate is m102.4, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the G glycoprotein of the Nipah virus, which prevents viral entry by blocking its interaction with ephrin-B2/B3 receptors, according to the ICMR.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe m102.4 antibody has shown strong protection in animal models and has been found safe in Phase 1 clinical trials, it said. Though definitive human efficacy data are lacking, the antibody has been used under compassionate protocols in Australia and was also made available to Kerala during recent outbreaks, the EoI document stated.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe importance of having monoclonal antibody stocks ready for deployment in India cannot be overstated, the apex health research body said. Given the very high case fatality rate and the absence of licensed vaccines, mAbs represent the only currently feasible biomedical countermeasure, it said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir greatest value lies in post-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk contacts, such as healthcare workers exposed without adequate protection, family members in close contact, or laboratory personnel with accidental exposure. Administered early, they can potentially prevent disease onset, as demonstrated convincingly in animal models.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, in patients presenting early during infection, monoclonal antibodies may offer a therapeutic benefit by reducing viral load and limiting progression, thereby complementing supportive critical care, the document added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMaintaining ready access to such antibodies ensures that India can act swiftly during an outbreak, it said. Pre-positioned stocks, streamlined regulatory and ethical approvals, and defined clinical protocols for prophylaxis and therapeutic use would allow immediate deployment without delays, which often occur when arrangements are attempted in the middle of an outbreak.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This readiness, combined with continued strengthening of surveillance, infection control practices, and One Health investigations of bat reservoirs, will be critical for limiting the impact of Nipah virus outbreaks in the future,\" the document concluded.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Looking ahead, India needs to build its own indigenous medical countermeasures against the Nipah virus, particularly monoclonal antibodies,\" the ICMR said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to move forward through active collaboration with Indian industry partners for developing an indigenous monoclonal antibody platform and manufacturing stock, which will not only ensure timely and reliable access during outbreaks but also strengthen national preparedness for emerging viral threats, it added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ICMR-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, one of the constituent institutes of the Indian Council of Medical Research, has already initiated research and development in this direction, with experimental work at an advanced stage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ICMR-NIV has state-of-the-art laboratory infrastructure, including BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, and the team possesses expertise in outbreak investigations, surveillance, virological and molecular characterisation, vaccine candidate development through virus inactivation and molecular methods, and conducting preclinical trials in suitable animal models.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe institute also specialises in laboratory testing to evaluate antibody and immune responses in clinical trials at different phases (I, II, and III). The infrastructure and resources available at ICMR institutes, as indicated above at ICMR-NIV, will be leveraged for joint research, development, and preclinical studies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the EoI document, the ICMR and its institutes will provide expert guidance and technical support in all phases of research and development for the creation of monoclonal antibodies against Nipah viral disease.</p><p></p></div>",
