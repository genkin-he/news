Beijing claims almost the entire region, while ASEAN members, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also claim ownership of coastal areas and features. The Philippines, a key US ally, has had frequent clashes with China's maritime fleet.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tManila has repeatedly urged a stronger regional response, but ASEAN has traditionally sought to balance caution with economic ties to Beijing, the region's largest trading partner.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHegseth criticised Beijing's recent declaration of Scarborough Shoal, which China forcefully seized from the Philippines in 2012, as a nature reserve.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tYou don't put platforms on nature reserves, he said, describing China's activities on the uninhabited shoal. He told the meeting it was yet another attempt to coerce new and expanded territorial and maritime claims at your expense.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHegseth said China's provocative actions challenged and threatened territorial sovereignty in the region. While stressing that Washington values continued dialogue with Beijing, Hegseth said the US will monitor China's behaviour closely.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina's sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea fly in the face of their commitments to resolve disputes peacefully, he said. \"We seek peace. We do not seek conflict. But we must ensure that China is not seeking to dominate you or anybody else.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHegseth urged ASEAN to hasten the conclusion of a Code of Conduct that the bloc is negotiating with China to govern behaviour at sea. But he said the bloc should also strengthen its capability, including enhanced joint surveillance and rapid-response tools to deter provocations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe proposed the development of a shared maritime domain awareness that will alert all members if one nation is threatened. That goes a long way in ensuring that whoever is on the receiving end of aggression and provocation is ... not alone, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe also welcomed plans for an ASEAN-US maritime exercise in December that he said would increase interoperability and reinforce freedom of navigation and the sovereign rights of all nations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina rejects US criticism of its maritime conduct, accusing Washington of interfering in regional affairs and provoking tensions through its military presence. Chinese officials say their patrols and construction activities are lawful and aimed at maintaining security in what they consider Chinese territory.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChinese officials on Saturday slammed the Philippines for being a troublemaker after Manila staged naval and air drills with the US, Australia and New Zealand in the South China Sea. The two-day exercise that ended Friday was the 12th that the Philippines says it has carried out with partner nations since last year to protect its rights in the disputed waters.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe drills included an anti-submarine warfare simulation, replenishment and fueling at sea, air operations and communication exercises.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTian Junli, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theatre Command, said the exercise seriously undermined regional peace and stability. It further proves that the Philippines is the troublemaker in the South China Sea issue and a saboteur of regional stability, he said.</p><p></p></div>",

But in 2025, Laura Wolvaardt and her fearless Proteas side turned history on its head.

Facing England in their opener, they were bundled out for a mere 65 — their lowest-ever World Cup total. Sinalo Jafta (22) was the only batter to cross double digits as the English bowlers wreaked havoc. England chased down the target without losing a wicket, inflicting a 10-wicket defeat.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut rather than breaking them, the humiliation became a turning point, a wake-up call that ignited a fire within the Proteas camp.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Redemption Begins: Clinical Win Over New Zealand (October 6, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBattered but not beaten, South Africa regrouped and produced a superb comeback in their next game against New Zealand at Indore. The bowlers, led by Nonkululeko Mlaba (4/40), dismantled the Kiwi batting order, restricting them to 231.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChasing the target, opener Tazmin Brits (101) and Sune Luus (83) combined beautifully in a steady partnership to guide South Africa home by six wickets with 55 balls to spare.

Chasing 252, Laura Wolvaardt (70) anchored the innings with her characteristic calm, while Chloe Tryon (49) provided crucial momentum.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tSouth Korean President Lee Jae Myung asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to make greater efforts to persuade North Korea to return to talks, as the two leaders on Saturday agreed on a set of agreements to expand their economic and other ties.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir one-on-one meeting came hours after they and other Asia-Pacific leaders wrapped up their annual summit in South Korea with a joint statement pledging stronger economic cooperation. The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to practice genuine multilateralism, according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xi, Lee discuss North Korea</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tChinese state media reports on the Xi-Lee meeting didn't immediately carry any North Korea-related comments by Xi.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Wi Sung-lac, Lee's national security director, said Lee during the meeting outlined his strategy for achieving denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and requested a constructive Chinese role to help realise the resumption of talks with North Korea.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tXi replied that he would continue his efforts to help resolve issues involving the Korean Peninsula and promote peace and stability here, Wi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina is North Korea's traditional ally and economic pipeline, but there are still questions about how much leverage it has on its impoverished neighbour. China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing UN sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against US influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about its daydream of realising North Korea's denuclearisation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea, said earlier Saturday he would take more active preemptive steps to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said South Korea and China also signed several agreements on jointly combating online scams, expanding a bilateral free trade deal and renewing a currency swap deal that expired last month.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders call for greater cooperation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAfter two days of talks, APEC leaders vowed greater cooperation to tackle shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by rising protectionism and trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir joint statement declared that the APEC leaders \"acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenges.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, it says.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea's National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting free and open trade, which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC's mission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It wasn't possible to leave that out entirely, said Min.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe joint declaration also said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that's free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile the summit's opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday's meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAPEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, ageing populations and accelerated urbanisation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that investing in China is investing in the future.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEstablished in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration. But the region now faces challenges such as the US-China rivalry, supply chain disruptions, ageing populations and the impact of AI on jobs.</p><p></p></div>",
