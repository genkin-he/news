Umang Vohra, MD and global chief executive officer (CEO) of Cipla said in the company’s earnings call, “The latest USFDA guidance is a significant positive for the industry as it sharply lowers development costs and accelerates timelines for biosimilars. Companies will no longer need to invest $40–90 million to secure an approvable package. This substantially reduces the burden of proving similarity.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis shift is likely to attract more players, spur investments, and fast-track market entry.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We will likely see an explosion in the number of players targeting biosimilars. Cipla operates in several categories that require $15–20 million in spending, which, while lower than biosimilars, still poses a high entry barrier. So, I don’t think this move will lead to the same level of competition as seen in the chemical side of the business,” Vohra said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe biosimilar market remains compelling with individual product opportunities still valued at $3–5 billion.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith the regulatory environment becoming more supportive, India has a strong opportunity to broaden participation in biosimilars, much like it did in small-molecule generics, pharma industry executives felt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe draft guidance removes the need for most comparative efficacy trials — the most expensive and time-consuming part of biosimilar development. Instead, it permits companies to rely on advanced analytical and functional studies to establish similarity with reference biologics.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also aims to simplify the pathway for granting “interchangeability” with original biologics, allowing pharmacists and patients to more easily opt for lower-cost substitutes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe USFDA has issued draft guidance aimed at streamlining the regulatory pathway for biosimilars, marking a potential shift in how these products are evaluated and approved.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/industry/news/godrej-consumer-products-signs-pact-to-acquire-muuchstac-in-all-cash-deal-125103101323_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Godrej Consumer Products signs pact to acquire Muuchstac in all-cash deal</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe draft recommends that a comparative analytical assessment (CAA), supported by human pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity data, will often be sufficient to demonstrate similarity with the reference biologic.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis approach seeks to eliminate routine comparative efficacy studies (CES) — the most time-consuming and expensive component of biosimilar development. But the CES may still be required for select products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSponsors will be responsible for determining the appropriate study design and are encouraged to discuss their plans with the agency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts estimate that if finalised, the new framework could significantly reduce trial requirements, compress development timelines from the current 8–9 years, and materially lower overall costs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama analysts felt the proposed model is expected to intensify competition and broaden participation in the US biosimilar market, where US and European companies currently dominate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndian manufacturers — benefiting from lower operating costs — stand to gain meaningfully as the market opens up.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to IQVIA, 118 biologics are set to lose patent protection between 2025 and 2034, representing a $232-billion opportunity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKey beneficiaries over the long term include Biocon, DRL, Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin, with Biocon particularly well-positioned due to its fully integrated biosimilar capabilities, they felt.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe draft guidance will remain under discussion for the next few months.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary general Sudarshan Jain said the simplification of interchangeability guidelines and approval pathways will create a more enabling environment for the industry to diversify into the large-molecule space.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“India already has nearly 130 approved biosimilars, and over the next seven years, more than 55 blockbuster drugs are expected to lose exclusivity in the US. India has long been a trusted partner in ensuring access to quality-assured, affordable medicines for American patients. These reforms will further strengthen the US–India partnership and our shared goal of improving healthcare access and affordability,” Jain added. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US biologics market is estimated to be around $100 billion, and the USFDA’s initiative is expected to encourage more Indian pharma players to tap it.</div></div>",

It reported a volume growth of 3 per cent in the domestic business during the quarter under review.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 5.8 per cent in the quarter ended September to ₹796.2 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCommenting on its results, Sitapati said, “Q2 FY26 has been a resilient quarter for Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), especially given the backdrop of the GST transition in India and continued macroeconomic challenges in Indonesia. Despite these headwinds, our India business, excluding soaps, has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth, reflecting the strength of our core portfolio and execution.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said that the recent GST rate reduction is a welcome structural reform that will strengthen long-term consumer demand.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs warned by the company ahead of its earnings, Sitapati said in the release, “However, this transition led to short-term trade disruptions as the channel adjusted to new pricing and cleared old inventory, particularly impacting soaps and hair colour. Despite this, we continue to gain market share in soaps and other key categories.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that in October, the company entered the ₹3,000-crore toilet cleaner category, which is growing at strong double digits.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our new brand, Godrej Spic, has been launched in select South Indian states, priced competitively at ₹79 for 500 ml, marking an important step in expanding our home care portfolio,” he said.</div></div>",

Jensen Huang is number one, and Sam Altman is another. Others like Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos now look like legacy figures,” he said. “Historically, every big technological transition — whether it was oil or finance — had towering figures like Rockefeller or JP Morgan. So this isn’t new.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile acknowledging that the euphoria feels “frothy,” Matthews does not believe the AI phase signals an imminent correction. “When you combine these flamboyant personalities with extreme bullishness, it does feel overheated. That said, I think the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq could still rise 15–20 per cent over the next 12 months.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCountering this view, Shankar Sharma, founder GQuant FinXRay noted that the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have done well only in dollar terms. “In euro terms, they’re lagging badly this year,” he said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Focus on China</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven as China’s economy has grown rapidly over the years, its muted stock market returns emerged as a key point of discussion. Since 2020, China’s CSI 300 index has gained nearly 13 per cent, even as the country’s economy has expanded multifold, Matthews said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMatthews also showed a slide depicting Tencent’s headquarters with a statue reading 'Join our party, start your business', a symbol of the state’s deep control over private enterprise.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith the state’s growing presence in India as well, Matthews cautioned that the single biggest risk for the country lies in rising inequality -- between rich and poor, and between old and young.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“When young people can’t find good jobs, societies tend to adopt more socialist policies, which usually don’t yield strong stock market returns,” he said. “China somehow built a prosperous economy despite poor market returns by distributing wealth. The danger is that other nations might try to copy China’s state-heavy model without understanding how it really worked.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Shankar Sharma offered a contrasting perspective. He argued that China had deliberately suppressed its stock market to channel talent into areas of real innovation, research and development (R&amp;D), manufacturing, and engineering, rather than into gaming or delivery apps.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This system is hard to replicate elsewhere,” Sharma said. “India, for instance, is already too financialised — too many engineers are building apps for food delivery instead of hard tech. It’s too late to reverse that model now.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Nationalism and deglobalisation</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAsked whether the rise of nationalism in major economies such as the US and China was hurting global growth, Matthews said the impact so far has been less severe than expected.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Superficially, it looks like it should be very bad, because we were all taught that globalization is good, that it creates activity and encourages the free flow of people and capital. A reversal should be bad, but somehow that’s not showing up in the numbers,\" he said. He added that the modern economy’s shift toward services may be cushioning the blow.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe country’s broking industry is in a “healthy pause” phase, a period of recalibration after the post-pandemic boom. Captains of the broking and wealth management industry believe market nervousness and tighter regulation in the derivatives segment have contributed to the slowdown, which is both expected and necessary.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking at the <em>Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit 2025</em> in Mumbai, Shripal Shah, MD &amp; CEO, Kotak Securities; Pranav Haridasan, MD &amp; CEO, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/axis-securities\" target=\"_blank\">Axis Securities</a>; Amisha Vora, chairperson and MD, PL Capital Group; and Ajay Menon, MD &amp; CEO - Retail Wealth, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, shared their insights on how the industry is evolving amid regulatory changes, rising compliance costs and an increasingly informed investor base.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCooling-off after record growth</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tFollowing an unprecedented surge during and after the pandemic, the broking industry has seen trading volumes and account openings moderate over the past year. “This pause is going to turn into a reboot mode,” said Shripal Shah of Kotak Securities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile derivative orders have dropped about 30 per cent from last year, he said the reset will prepare the industry for deeper market participation. “About 63 per cent of Indian households are aware of the capital market, but only 9.5 per cent participate. The next phase of growth lies in bridging that gap,” Shah said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tLong road to market penetration</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India’s equity participation continues to trail global peers, Pranav Haridasan of Axis Securities points out that market maturity evolves alongside rising income levels. “In the US, 55–60 per cent of people invest in equities, while China is around 18–20 per cent. India will see participation rise as per capita GDP improves,” he said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also cautioned that the journey ahead will be gradual. “Unlike the Covid-era spurt, this will be a secular, steady journey,” he said. The industry is now focusing on sustainable account growth and the right customer targeting, enabled by data and technology.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaridasan emphasised that awareness alone isn’t enough and education must accompany access. “There is a real need in financial services to teach the basics of investing really well,” Haridasan added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tCompliance, cost and youth factor</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRising compliance and cybersecurity spending continue to shape the industry’s cost structure. Compliance costs have gone up by the day, from cyber safeguards to account opening norms. But this discipline will strengthen the ecosystem, opines Amisha Vora of PL Capital Group.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVora also noted how new investors are reshaping market dynamics. “Over 50 per cent of new accounts in the industry were opened in North and East India. less than 50 per cent of new accounts were opened in the western and southern regions, which are considered more financially literate,” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd, the young demographic will be central to long-term market growth in India. “More than half of new investors are below 30 years of age, their continued participation, directly or through mutual funds, is a structural positive,” she said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tFrom short-term gains to long-term vision</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile digital access has democratised investing, the challenge lies in converting new traders into disciplined, long-term investors. Ajay Menon of Motilal Oswal Financial Services pointed out that retail investors are maturing fast. “Investors are smart. They know that consistently putting money into the market will give them long-term growth in their overall investment journey,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDiversification remains key to wealth creation, with a focus on spreading investments across mutual fund SIPs, insurance, and alternate assets to strengthen clients’ long-term wealth journeys, Menon said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also underscored the importance of systematic investing, “From a retail investor’s perspective, there needs to be some amount of investment into mutual fund SIPs, since it gives you a sustained growth journey.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tDigital push for the sector</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile discount brokers have transformed the landscape, full-service players are keeping pace through digital innovation and advisory depth. “Today, a full-service broker can offer a digital platform as advanced as any discount player, with the added advantage of research and education,” said Shripal Shah of Kotak Securities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that industry consolidation will be driven less by regulation and more by the need for technology investment and resilience, Shah said. The panellists at the BS BFSI Insight Summit agreed that as AI-driven advisory, financial education and responsible leverage take root, India’s broking industry will emerge stronger.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tConsolidation and the road ahead</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tLooking ahead, the industry leaders agreed that consolidation is inevitable as compliance, technology and cybersecurity requirements demand scale. “Smaller players may merge or exit, but innovation will continue,” Shah said. “There’s still a lot of potential in AI-led advisory and automation.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaridasan emphasised that the industry’s fundamentals remain strong. The broking industry has taken a pause, but it’s rebooting. With AI, data analytics and rising financial literacy, the next phase will be more efficient, inclusive and resilient, he shared. </div></div>",

            "id": 125103101250,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWith Indian markets yet to hit new highs in 2025, <strong>Mark Matthews</strong>, managing director and head of research for Asia at Julius Baer, tells <em>Puneet Wadhwa</em> in a fireside chat that India is the only essential emerging market for global portfolios. India’s two big strengths, he believes, are its demographics and 'Jugaad' – the ‘can-do’ spirit. Edited excerpts:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How do you assess the year 2025 for global financial markets, excluding India?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn one word, surprising. Truth be told, if you had asked me in January 2025 how global markets would perform this year, I would have said there was over a 50 per cent chance they would be down. Yet here we are, with the bellwether equity index, the S&amp;P 500, up 17 per cent, much better than the long-term average. It has been a surprising year. What’s even more incredible is that emerging markets (EM) as a whole are up over 30 per cent. So yes, it’s been a really surprising year, and that makes me somewhat uncomfortable forecasting the next one.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The US markets have made consistent highs throughout 2025, whereas the Indian markets have done so just once at the benchmark level. Would you say the Indian markets have decoupled from the US?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo. The Nifty is up about 6 to 7 per cent in US dollar terms. That’s a perfectly good return — annualised, it's around 11 to 12 per cent. So, it’s not that India has gone down, but it has underperformed the US and its emerging market peers. There are two main reasons for this. First, China. A year ago, Indian fund managers feared that China would become investable again, and it has. Second, corporate earnings in India have disappointed, but are nearing an inflection point. With goods and services tax (GST) cuts kicking in late September, along with monetary easing, income tax cuts, and a favourable base, fiscal year 2027 could see double-digit earnings growth. In the September quarter results, the number of misses are half what it was in the previous two quarters. Nearly 20 per cent of the companies that reported results have missed, as compared to about 40 per cent for the previous two quarters.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Were Indian markets boring in 2025 as risk reward seemed favourable elsewhere; disappointing in terms of returns; or challenging in terms of lack of investment opportunities?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI would describe India as a rather boring market this year. To be honest, I’ve been catching up on developments in China, which has made a big comeback. China’s progress across several high-technology sectors has been remarkable.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the US market nearing a bubble, especially given the performance of the 'Magnificent 7' technology stocks?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tYou could define a bubble either by valuations or by technicals. Surprisingly, by neither measure is the US market in a bubble yet.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Nasdaq-100 has not deviated significantly from its long-term trend, unlike the dot-com bubble of 1998–1999, which was about three standard deviations above the average. Currently, it’s less than one standard deviation above trend.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs for valuations, the forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of the Magnificent 7 is about 33 times for the next 12 months and around 23 times for the next 24 months. In contrast, during the 1990s bubble, major tech stocks were trading at about 50 times PE. So, the US market is not yet in bubble territory.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Is the lack of AI investment by Indian IT companies a concern?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo, quite the contrary. The danger lies in the scale of artificial intelligence (AI) spending by hyperscalers. This year alone, the big five are investing $375 billion, and over the next three years, about $1.1 trillion, more than the size of the German stock market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe risk is that these companies may not earn adequate returns. AI will benefit the broader economy through productivity and efficiency gains, but the companies making massive upfront investments bear the real risk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What returns do you expect from Indian equities over the next year?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOver the long-term, I believe small and mid-caps will outperform simply because they have more room to grow. For the next 12 months, I expect returns of around 15 per cent, driven by expected earnings growth of about 16-18 per cent for the Nifty in fiscal year 2027. The market isn’t expensive relative to peers, and as earnings momentum picks up, there is room for re-rating.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What could drive Indian markets over the next three to five years?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia’s two big strengths are its demographics and its 'Jugaad' – the ‘can-do’ spirit. India has more people entering the prime earning age (30–60 years) than any other country, and this advantage should last until around 2060. The second factor, Jugaad, reflects India’s positive, problem-solving attitude, which is often lacking elsewhere.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What’s your view on gold and silver?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tGold, historically, has returned about 5 per cent per year in dollars and serves as a hedge against inflation. Recent price increases are not unusual, they’re partly due to geopolitical tensions and the confiscation of Russian assets, which has undermined trust in Western financial systems.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI expect gold to correct modestly to around $3,500 per ounce before rising to $4,500 within a year. Some optimistic projections even see it reaching $6,600 eventually, and yes, I think that’s possible.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>For investors looking to enter India now, is this the right time, or should they look elsewhere?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIndia is fairly priced. Earnings growth looks solid for next year. India is the only essential emerging market for global portfolios — you don’t need Brazil, Indonesia, or Turkey, but you do need India, which has consistently delivered strong returns and should continue to do so.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
