            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tAt a secret location in rural Ukraine, columns of attack drones are assembled at night and in near silence to strike deep inside Russia.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir targets are strategic: oil refineries, fuel depots, and military logistics hubs. Since the summer, Ukraine's long-range drone campaign has ramped up dramatically, pounding energy infrastructure across Russia and stretching Moscow's air defences thin.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBuilt from parts made in a scattered network of workshops, these drones now fly much further than at any point in the war.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOfficers in body armour move with quick precision; headlamps glow red to stay hidden. Engines sputter like old motorcycles as exhaust fumes drift into the moonless night. Minutes later, one after another, the drones lift from a makeshift runway and head east. The strikes have caused gasoline shortages in Russia, even forcing rationing in some regions and underscoring a growing vulnerability in the country's infrastructure.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Drones hammer refineries</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWestern analysts say the attacks on energy infrastructure so far have had a serious but not crippling effect. Ukrainian drones have repeatedly hit 16 major Russian refineries, representing about 38 per cent of the country's nominal refining capacity, according to a recent review by the Carnegie Endowment, a US-based think tank.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut it argues the actual impact has been considerably more limited: most plants resumed operations within weeks, and Russia's refining output has been cushioned by idle capacity and existing fuel surpluses.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe deep strikes have, however, given Kyiv the initiative at an important moment. The United States and Europe are ramping up sanctions on Russia's oil industry even as Kyiv's request for US long-range Tomahawk missiles has stalled. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine's improved long-range strike capability is causing real damage forcing the Kremlin to import fuel and curb exports. We believe they've lost up to 20 per cent of their gasoline supply directly as a result of our strikes, he told reporters at a briefing in Kyiv.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAt the secret launch site, the commander overseeing the operation a broad-shouldered man identified by his call sign, Fidel, in accordance with Ukrainian military regulations watches through night-vision goggles as the drones climb into the star-filled sky.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDrones are evolving, Fidel told The Associated Press. Instead of flying 500 kilometers (310 miles), now they fly 1,000 ... Three factors go into a successful operation: the drones, the people and the planning. We want to deliver the best result. For us, this is a holy mission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ukraine thrives on no-frills weapons</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tMuch of Ukraine's fleet is homegrown. The Liutyi, a workhorse of the nightly attacks, is a waist-high craft with a sausage-shaped body, a propeller at the back, and a distinctive triangular tail.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt looks neither sleek nor intimidating more Home Depot than Lockheed Martin but the ease of assembly means it can be kept hidden and constantly tweaked: optimized to slip through heavily monitored frontline airspace.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTypical of Ukraine's no-frills war production philosophy, the Liutyi whose name means fierce in Ukrainian has become a symbol of national pride and recently featured on a local postage stamp.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe reach of these drones with some models doubling in range over the past year to routinely strike targets within a 1,000-kilometer radius of the border marks a shift in the geography of the conflict. Attacks a year ago damaged refineries in a much narrower range, mostly in western Russian border regions. Costs have also come down, further testing expensive air defense systems, with long-range drones now being produced in Ukraine for as little as USD 55,000.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>A shift in conflict geography</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhat we're seeing is that Ukraine is getting better at taking the war inside Russia, said Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at RANE, a global risk analysis firm. For most of the war, Russia operated on the assumption that its own territory was safe. That's no longer the case.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe strategic logic is attrition by logistics, he argued: by forcing Russia to reroute supplies and commit air defences to a wider area, Kyiv seeks to degrade Moscow's capacity to sustain large-scale operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Paris-based International Energy Agency says repeated drone strikes have cut Russia's refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels a day. That's triggered domestic fuel shortages and curbed exports of diesel and jet fuel, even as overall global oil production remains steady and prices stable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tKyiv's homegrown strike capability allows independent drone launches, bypassing the Western approval required for imported long-range weapons. That autonomy preceded tougher sanctions on Russia: allies escalated only after Ukraine had spent months hitting Russian refineries.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the ground, each mission is a study in tradeoffs. Fewer than 30 per cent of drones even reach the target area, so meticulous planning is essential, said Fidel, who reflected on the human cost. War has fallen to our generation so that we can fight for our kids and they can live in a free democratic country, he said. We are currently obtaining experience that will be used by every country in the world, and we are paying the price with our lives and the lives of our friends.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Seven expressways, 10 industrial parks, free quality education from KG to PG and Rs 2000 aid per month for SC students pursuing higher education are some of the other features of the manifesto.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe NDA's manifesto is a string of lies. We will highlight this in our public rallies, and demand a report card of the 20 years of NDA rule,\" Gehlot said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe NDA leaders should have begun their press conference with the report card, he said.</p><p></p></div>",

The newly appointed Fed governor, Stephen Miran, dissented once again as he called for a 50-bps cut, while Jeffery Schmid, the Kansas Fed President, dissented against the rate cut, which was a hawkish surprise. The Fed said that it will end the asset runoff (reduction of its securities holdings) beginning on December 1. The Fed Chair Powell warned in his presser that the December rate cut was not a done deal as the Fed faces a lack of data due to the ongoing US government partial shutdown.  Hawkish FOMC decision weighed on commodities as the US Dollar Index and yields shot up.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn October 29, the Central Bank of Canada cut its interest rate by 25 bps to 2.25 per cent amid tariff wars, though it signalled that its borrowing costs have reached the right level as long as its forecasts hold good.</div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn yet another key decision, as expected, on October 30, the European Central Bank left key interest rates unchanged for a third meeting as inflation is around the Bank's goal of 2 per cent and the economy continues to grow. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Euro area economy grew 0.2 per cent (forecast 0.1 per cent) on a Q-o-Q basis in Q3.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tUS Dollar and yields</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US Dollar Index, boosted by hawkish FOMC rate cut, gained nearly 0.5 per cent on October 29.
