Once in orbit, CMS-03 will provide multi-band communication services over a wide region that includes the Indian landmass and nearby ocean areas.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe CMS-03 satellite is designed to improve telecom, television broadcasting, and broadband services across India and its surrounding oceans. It will replace older satellites and help strengthen connectivity for remote regions, ships, and aircraft over the Indian Ocean.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How does the rocket work?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rocket works in three stages. In the first stage, two giant boosters called S200 solid boosters fire up together to lift the rocket off the ground. These boosters are packed with solid fuel that burns very quickly, producing a strong thrust to overcome the earth’s gravity. They burn for about 134 seconds (a little over two minutes) before separating and falling away once their fuel is used up.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the second stage, known as the L110 liquid core stage, the main liquid engine starts working while the solid boosters are still burning — about 113 seconds into the flight. It uses liquid fuel, which allows more precise control over the rocket’s movement. As the rocket climbs higher, about 115 km above the earth, the payload fairing (the top cover that protects the satellite during launch) opens and drops off since there’s no more air resistance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFinally, the third stage, called the C25 cryogenic stage, takes over after the liquid stage completes its job at around 313 seconds. “Cryogenic” means it runs on super-cold fuel stored at extremely low temperatures. This stage gives the final, powerful push needed to place the satellite into space. It continues burning until the satellite reaches its target — the GTO, a very high orbit roughly 36,000 km above the earth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why is the launch important?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIf the launch is successful, it will become the heaviest satellite ever launched from the Indian soil. It will reaffirm LVM3’s capability to let India launch heavy satellites independently, without depending on foreign launchers. Meanwhile, the CMS-03 will support digital connectivity, disaster management, and secure communication services, marking another major step forward in India’s space journey.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n</div>",

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said, “I like him a lot. But you know what they did was wrong. He (Carney) was very nice. He apologised for what they did with the commercial.”<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/world-news/xi-jinping-warns-leaders-against-us-led-efforts-to-cut-china-supply-chain-125110100132_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">'Prevent world from returning to law of jungle': Xi warns against bullying</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReiterating that the ad was false, Trump said, “It was the exact opposite. Ronald Reagan loved tariffs, and they tried to make it look like the other way. He did apologise, and I appreciated it.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump also added that he maintains a \"very good relationship\" with the Canadian prime minister.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tFord defends the ad</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who commissioned the advertisement, defended it despite the backlash. According to <em>The Globe and Mail, </em>Ford said Carney had previewed the ad before it was aired. He explained that the ad, shown during the World Series, aimed to promote fair trade and highlight the risks of tariffs, not to provoke the US.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe ad ran over the weekend before being pulled on Monday. Ford claimed it was viewed over a billion times, calling it “the most successful ad in North American history.\"</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat the ad featured?</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe one-minute video used clips from a 1987 speech by Republican and former US President Ronald Reagan, where he warned that tariffs “hurt every American” and could trigger “fierce trade wars.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the quotes were genuine, they were taken out of sequence. According to the <em>BBC</em>, in his original speech, Reagan had also mentioned imposing limited tariffs on some Japanese imports but reaffirmed his support for free trade overall.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Ronald Reagan Foundation later said the ad misrepresented Reagan’s message, adding to tensions already running high between the US and Canada over tariff policies.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tTrump cancels trade negotiations</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAngered by the ad, President Trump had announced the suspension of all trade negotiations with Canada. “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Based on their egregious behaviour, all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated,” he added. Trump also confirmed a 10 per cent tariff increase on goods imported from Canada following the controversy.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tFormer President Barack Obama will headline rallies Saturday for Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, corralling voters ahead of elections that may signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump's second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans in those states are stumping as well on the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's elections, but without the national star power.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd on the west coast, California advocates are making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favour. The effort backed by Gov Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tObama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation's first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tVirginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>Democrats need strong Black turnout</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tDemocratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats' coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBlack folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They're inspired by the way that he governed himself, said Scott, Virginia's first Black state House speaker.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tObama's campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party's base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats' lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd, Scott's protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats' usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Trump isn't on site but he's in the conversation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tTrump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said without naming Earle-Sears that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThat reflects the tightrope Republicans must walk: Trump remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSpanberger and Sherrill have tried to capitalize.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJack won't say one bad word about the president, Sherrill charged in a debate with Ciattarelli.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCiattarelli countered that no matter who sits in the White House, my job is to stand up for the 9.3 million citizens of the state, and I will. He then played up his Trump ties. It's best to have a relationship with whoever occupies the White House, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEarle-Sears aligns herself with the president, and according to AdImpact data, Spanberger's biggest advertising investment has gone to spots that try to tie Earle-Sears to Trump.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe lieutenant governor will lead GOP turnout rallies Saturday in Republican-rich small towns, first in Abingdon in the southwest corner of Virginia, then in Purceville, in the state's northernmost reaches near the Pennsylvania border.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCiattarelli has stops in Woodbridge, Westfield and Fairfield, an itinerary that puts him in the exurbs of Newark, then across the state in a considerably less densely populated, more Republican swath.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The economy and shutdown overshadow the governor's races</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tSpanberger and Sherrill, both center-left Democrats who helped the party retake the US House in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first term, have emphasized economic arguments.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThey've pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans' federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger has highlighted Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and, to a lesser degree, the ongoing federal shutdown both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the US Census Bureau.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEarle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia's Democratic US senators. Both senators have voted against the GOP's spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state to make the procedure widely accessible. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, trying to frame Spanberger as out of step with mainstream voters in the same way Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>California will have an immediate midterm impact</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact on the national landscape.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tVoters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map that is intended to send five more Democrats to Washington.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's a direct counter to neutralize Texas' plan, already approved, that was drawn to tilt five seats in that state to the Republican column. And more states have followed suit, putting the national map itself in flux in an unprecedented mid-decade scramble years after the usual post-census redistricting process.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House. That means just a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority that, if patterned after his first term, blocks his agenda, opens an investigation of his administration and considers articles of impeachment.</p><p></p></div>",
