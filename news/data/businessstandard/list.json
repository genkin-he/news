The company is on track to double its fleet and targets a ₹1000 crore turnover by next year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"IntrCity SmartBus continues to scale-up organically and profitably and is projected to maintain its 50 per cent year-over-year growth this year,” Kapil Raizada, co-founder and president, IntrCity SmartBus told Business Standard. “This new capital enables us to further double-down on our vision to transform the bus-travel landscape in India and expand our network to more Tier-II and Tier-III cities.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIntrCity SmartBus is an asset-less bus network and provides safe and standardised travel options around India’s long-distance routes, operating across over 630 routes in 15 states. Its companion brand, RailYatri, is a popular digital platform for train travel in India, providing a simplified train ticket booking experience along with comprehensive trip data and insights, serving more than 12 million users monthly.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The investment will be used to further raise the bar on customer satisfaction, operational excellence and service expansion,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), IntrCity SmartBus. “This investment will also help our operator-partners to grow and monetise their asset portfolio faster with us.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMuch of this is driven by the company’s technology backbone. IntrCity has developed a suite of proprietary tools,  including an operator dashboard, crew app, and IoT-enabled fleet analytics system, that help manage daily operations across its expanding network. These platforms enable real-time tracking, accurate ETA visibility, dynamic route management, and centralised monitoring of every journey. From automated luggage management to predictive maintenance insights, the company’s tech stack is designed to bring efficiency to a category that has traditionally lacked both.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“They have built a trusted, pan-India brand through exceptional quality, consistency and customer service,” said Gautam Mago, general partner at A91 Partners. “This provides a platform to build a category-defining leader in inter-city mobility.

Given the country’s huge population and rapid urbanisation, there is an increasing demand for various modes of transportation, including personal and public.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia’s expanding highway network is fueling a surge in the country’s intercity travel sector, particularly the outstation bus market. The segment is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10 per cent to 13 per cent between fiscals 2020 (FY20) and 2025, according to a report by IntrCity SmartBus and consulting firm 1Lattice.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report estimated India’s overall outstation travel market at $66 billion in FY20, with bus travel accounting for about $30.3 billion, or roughly 45% of the total. While the pandemic slowed demand in FY21 and FY22, the rebound since then has been strong.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMuch of the sector’s recent momentum is being powered by full-stack technology aggregators, such as IntrCity SmartBus and Zingbus. These players are using end-to-end digital platforms to streamline operations, improve reliability, and enhance passenger experience — changes that are reshaping one of India’s most vital modes of intercity transport, the report notes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile India’s roads and highways have improved significantly, the country still lacks adequate bus infrastructure, especially around cities, according to Raizada of IntrCity SmartBus.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite better vehicles and connectivity, poor bus terminals and facilities remain a major barrier to public transport adoption, he noted. Raizada pointed to the imbalance in public spending, saying that far more money goes into building airports than bus terminals, even though bus travel serves a much larger population.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If taxpayer money can fund airports, it should also fund bus ports,” he said. He added that better terminals, parking, rain shelters, clean food, and drinking water are essential to make bus travel more appealing. Without these, he warned, car travel may overtake buses due to infrastructure gaps, not preference.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe urged that transit points be developed with metro and taxi connectivity to make bus travel more convenient.</div></div>",

            "id": 125103000957,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tIn a rare medical phenomenon, four sisters from West Virginia — Austyn, Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee Higginbotha, have all been diagnosed with Chiari malformation. It is a structural defect in the skull that affects how the brain sits and functions. Doctors have described the case as extremely unusual, given that such clustering in one family is exceptionally rare.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat is Chiari malformation?</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, Chiari malformation (CM) occurs when part of the brain, known as the cerebellum, extends into the spinal canal through an opening at the base of the skull (foramen magnum). As per Dr David Harter, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone, this happens when the lower portion of the brain doesn’t fit properly within the skull. This can block the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid and put pressure on the brain as well as the spinal cord.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe condition is often congenital (condition or trait that is present at birth) but may not show symptoms until later in life. Common signs include:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\t Severe headaches – especially when coughing or straining</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDizziness</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tBalance problems</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tMuscle weakness</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tNumbness in the limbs</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tHeart palpitations</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDifficulty falling asleep and chronic fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome cases also involve tethered spinal cords, where the spinal cord is abnormally attached, causing restricted movement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tHigginbotham sisters’ story</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe family’s journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, started showing worrying symptoms as a baby such as constant crying, poor sleep, tremors, and developmental delays. At 18 months, she was diagnosed with Chiari malformation and spinal compression, requiring surgery to relieve pressure and restore fluid flow.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSoon after, her sister Amelia, aged three, was diagnosed with the same condition and a tethered spinal cord. She underwent two surgeries in October 2023. Then, Aubrey, aged seven, developed similar symptoms and had surgery a month later, in November 2023. The eldest affected sister, Adalee aged 11, had struggled with leg pain and mobility issues for years before being diagnosed. Her surgery was performed in March 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe girls have since recovered well, with their mother noting that Austyn “was trying to walk, smiling, full of energy” shortly after surgery. The two elder kids were also tested, and did not have the condition.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Jeffrey Greenfield, pediatric neurosurgeon at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, who treated the sisters, described the occurrence as “extraordinary”, noting that only about 10 per cent of Chiari cases have a known genetic link, and it is even rarer for several siblings within the same family to be affected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tThe road to recovery</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTreatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the level of pressure on the brain and spine. In serious cases, decompression surgery is performed to remove a small portion of bone at the skull base, helping normalise fluid flow. According to US-based Cleveland Clinic, many patients experience significant relief post-surgery, though some may need follow-up procedures.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAll four Higginbotham sisters are now recovering under regular medical supervision. Early detection and intervention have been crucial in improving their outcomes. Without treatment, Chiari malformation can lead to chronic pain, nerve damage, or paralysis.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhy this case matters</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThis rare case underscores the importance of awareness and early diagnosis. Multiple siblings being diagnosed with the same structural brain defect highlights the potential genetic factors behind Chiari malformation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDoctors recommend that families with one diagnosed child consider screening siblings if symptoms appear. Recognising early warning signs such as persistent headaches, neck pain, or motor issues can make a life-changing difference.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Higginbotham family’s experience serves as both a medical mystery and a hopeful reminder: with timely diagnosis and specialist care, children with Chiari malformation can recover and live normal lives.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div></div>",
