Retain ‘Buy’ with an SotP-based TP of ₹413 (earlier ₹401), at 2.5x FY27E SA book + NTPC Green at a 30 per cent discount to CMP (₹105),” said Subhadip Mitra, Vikram Datwani, Mahir Moondra and Divyam Sureka of Nuvama, in a note dated October 30, 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tSteady quarterly performance</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor the September quarter of FY26 (Q2FY26), NTPC’s standalone adjusted profit after tax (PAT) rose 7.5 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to around ₹4,500 crore, driven primarily by a sharp 66 per cent jump in other income and lower interest expenses, which are passed through in regulated tariffs. Operating performance was largely in line, though weak power demand led to a dip in plant load factor (PLF) to 66 per cent versus 72.3 per cent a year ago. This weighed on core RoE, which slipped to 14.4 per cent from 15.8 per cent Y-o-Y despite a 6 per cent rise in regulated equity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn a consolidated basis, profit remained flat Y-o-Y at ₹5,230 crore as lower dividends from subsidiaries and joint ventures offset a notable improvement in subsidiary-level profits (₹1,150 crore vs ₹840 crore last year). Management guided that fixed cost under-recovery, which stood at ₹625 crore in the first half, should decline to ₹250 crore by Q4FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tExpansion momentum intact</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNTPC’s group generation declined around 6 per cent Y-o-Y during the quarter due to subdued demand. However, capacity expansion remains on track with 33GW under construction (17.3GW thermal, 2.2GW hydro, and the rest renewable). The company has revised its commissioning guidance to 9.2GW for FY26 (2.8GW thermal, 1GW hydro, 5.4GW renewables) and about 10.5GW for FY27. Most upcoming projects are housed under subsidiaries or joint ventures, suggesting that consolidated earnings will capture most of the future growth. NTPC targets over 60GW of operational renewable capacity by FY32, up from 7.4GW as of September 2025. The company also declared an interim dividend of ₹2.75 per share for Q2FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tForay into nuclear, storage</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNTPC is expanding into nuclear power through its Ashvini JV with NPCIL, which is developing the 4×700MW Mahi Banswara project in Rajasthan. The foundation stone was laid in September 2025, with additional sites identified through state MoUs. The company’s pumped storage portfolio stands at 21.2GW, including 11GW directly under NTPC and 10.4GW through THDC and NEEPCO.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, NTPC has been allocated a 5,000MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) under the viability gap funding scheme to enhance thermal plant efficiency and ensure power supply during non-solar hours.

In Japan, he helicoptered to a mammoth aircraft carrier for a speech with the country's prime minister. And South Korea gave him a gold medal and crown as gifts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBack home in Washington, the federal government was shut down as Trump's poll numbers remain low, and it's unclear how much Trump's trip will resonate with voters consumed by other concerns at home.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tYet on the last night of his trip, Trump was overheard at a state dinner talking about how much he enjoyed meetings with his foreign counterparts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat was a great meeting, Trump said. They're all great meetings. This was a great meeting. We had a fantastic meeting.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHad a president who once used the term globalist as a slur suddenly found the fun in being a little bit globalist? He definitely likes the international deal making, the parties in his honour, the praise from other leaders and the possibility of leaving his mark on the wider world.</p>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/world-news/donald-trump-xi-jinping-meeting-us-china-tariff-drop-fentanyl-curbs-125103000356_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump drops China tariffs from 57% to 47% after meeting Xi in South Korea</a></strong></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe president sees diplomacy as a way to fulfil his domestic agenda of creating factory jobs, said Carla Sands, who was the US ambassador to Denmark during Trump's first term and is now chair of the foreign policy initiative at the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tPresident Trump is working as fast as possible to reindustrialise America, bring jobs back home, and secure better trade deals for the American people and businesses, Sands said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ebullience abroad also reflects the mood of a president who has struck economic deals and helped smooth relations between warring nations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe helped to affirm a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand. There's a detailed list of nearly $500 billion in investment commitments from Japan. And South Korea pledged $150 billion to help revive American shipbuilding, including a project to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine on top of $200 billion in investments over a decade to the US.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not globalism to go to other countries and stand up for America, said Hogan Gidley, a former White House aide who travelled to Asia and other foreign destinations with Trump in his first term. When Trump travels, he makes sure the globe is fully aware that this president is going to stand up for the American people first, Gidley said, making it the exact opposite of globalism.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs for the dancing?<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tLook, when you're scoring touchdowns, it's OK to dance in the end zone, Gidley said. And this president is scoring touchdowns and running up the score.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMany Trump voters believed they were electing a president who would focus on them instead of distant countries. But Trump in his second term is increasingly finding it easier to sell the idea of America with jaunts to Asia and the Middle East.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/world-news/us-judge-blocks-trump-admin-from-firing-workers-during-govt-shutdown-125102900031_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">US judge blocks Trump admin from firing workers during govt shutdown</a></strong></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe shift in tone reflects foreign governments' strenuous efforts to keep Trump happy, like stationing American-made vehicles near him in Tokyo and featuring US-raised beef on the menu.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump is increasingly showing confidence that he can play on the global stage, instead of grinding metaphorical axes as he did during his first term by attacking NATO and finding ways to intimidate and frustrate allies such as Angela Merkel, then the chancellor of Germany.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe appears to believe in his skills as a one-on-one negotiator with world leaders, said Jasen Castillo, a professor with a focus on national security at Texas A&amp;M University. All of this suggests that his foreign policy ventures are genuine.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tStill, it's not always clear what Trump is trying to achieve, other than a chance to declare victory. Some of his trade talks have led to foreign countries promising investments, but not necessarily the careful negotiations on which durable coalitions are built.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhat can confuse observers is that he lacks a consistent, coherent world view, Castillo added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US president in Asia was hardly the grimacing presence he's been at times in the Oval Office, where he's objected to the support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sought in the war against Russia and chastised post-apartheid South Africans on their treatment of white Afrikaners.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Asia, it was a lovefest. Trump said Southeast Asian nations had spectacular leaders, the new Japanese prime minister was a winner and the South Korean president could go down as the greatest of them all.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRather than complaining about foreign countries ripping off America, he told business leaders that the best deals are deals that work for everybody.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump was similarly effusive after sitting down on Thursday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping shortly before returning to Washington.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump seems to enjoy doing foreign policy on his own terms. He prizes bold shows of force, like attacking nuclear sites in Iran and boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe minimises participation in lengthy multilateral meetings that can require more listening than talking.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tArriving at the summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Trump offered a spot in the armoured presidential limousine to Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was thrilled to join him in the vehicle nicknamed The Beast.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the president arrives, he asked me to join him in the car, Anwar later recalled in a speech. I said, That's against the security and protocol rules, and he was delighted to break the rules.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe White House said that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi planned to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, with Takaichi telling him she was so impressed and inspired by Trump's commitment to world peace and stability.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSouth Korean President Lee Jae Myung said Trump will be recognised forever in the history of humanity if he could bring his peacemaker skills to ending the military standoff with North Korea, before complimenting him for US stock indexes hitting a record high.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEven the far more reserved Xi seemed to suggest that Trump's policies behind elevating America were also good for China.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI always believe that China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to 'Make America Great Again', Xi said through a translator.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the White House is trumpeting the results of Trump's trip back home, it's unclear how much his foreign policy actions mattered to a country worried about inflation staying high.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGoing into the 2025 elections Tuesday with a mayoral race in New York City and governors' elections in Virginia and New Jersey, many Americans are harbouring deep anxieties about Trump's leadership. The monthlong government shutdown is starting to cause pain with missed paychecks and government food aid no longer being available to millions of families.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAbout 6 in 10 US adults disapprove of Trump's performance as president, according to an October poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump told his audiences in Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo and South Korea that America has never been better.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe're literally sort of an inspiration to a lot of other countries, Trump said.</p><p></p></div>",

Toyota sold over 300,000 vehicles in India last year, of which about 60 per cent were Suzuki models, and has a growing share of exports to countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tToyota's capacity expansion will happen in phases, but once complete, it will be able to produce over 1 million cars a year in India between its two manufacturing sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe carmaker's hybrids like the Urban Cruiser Hyryder SUV and Innova Hycross MPV have helped it carve out a lead in alternate-fuel vehicles - something it plans to build on with new product launches, the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAt its new plant in western Aurangabad city, Toyota's first product is expected to be an SUV which will come with multiple powertrains including gasoline, hybrid and electric and which will be sold in India and exported, the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to Toyota's $3 billion investment, Suzuki announced in August that it would invest $8 billion in India over the next five to six years. Hyundai Motor said this month, it will invest $5 billion to expand its Indian manufacturing and research operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(Reporting by Aditi Shah in Tokyo, Additional reporting by Daniel Leussink; Editing by David Dolan and Edwina Gibbs)</p><p></p></div>",
