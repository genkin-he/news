            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tEquity investors will need to rely on sound stock-picking and patience to generate superior returns in the coming years, said market experts at <em>Business Standard</em> BFSI Insight Summit in Mumbai.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe experts spoke at a panel discussion titled ‘Where Are The Market Opportunities — Where Should Investors Allocate?’ moderated by <em>Sundar Sethuraman</em> of <em>Business Standard</em>.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are at a stage where stock-picking becomes important. It’s very much a bottom-up market. The easy money that existed earlier is no longer available. Investors must remember that equities are a long-term asset class — requiring discipline, conviction, and a focus on fundamentals,” said Pramod Gubbi, cofounder of Marcellus Investment Managers.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the moderate equity returns seen this year, panellists noted that the market is merely adjusting after years of excessive post-pandemic gains.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We had four years of exuberance post-pandemic and are now witnessing a return to normalcy. But valuations still remain above historical averages. Between caution and optimism, it’s fair to say investors need to be cautiously optimistic. The core of equity investing is risk management — there are no obvious themes to play right now. Returns and earnings growth have both been in single digits, and valuations have time-corrected. Yet, markets are not exactly screaming buys either,” Gubbi said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManish Gunwani, head of equities at Bandhan Asset Management Company, said investors should maintain a long-term view rather than fixate on near-term valuations. “Over the long term, equities tend to deliver 5-7 per cent above inflation. Over a 10- to 20-year period, that translates into roughly 6.5-7 per cent. So investors need to be neither greedy nor fearful. While valuations may not be cheap currently, global government debt is at record highs — often a precursor to easier monetary policy. On a three- to five-year horizon, double-digit equity returns remain my base case,” Gunwani said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe experts observed that several positive policy measures — including higher income tax limits in the last Union Budget, rationalisation of the goods and services tax, and recent rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India — have created a supportive environment for an economic and earnings recovery.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve had enough policy measures introduced. Large parts of the economy should begin to pick up. Although earnings growth has been patchy lately, it is likely to improve. Earnings estimates for the next two years may settle at mid-single digits after some revisions, still suggesting healthy equity returns compared to other asset classes,” said Gaurav Misra, head of equity at Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHari Shyamsunder, vice-president and senior client portfolio manager — emerging markets equity (India), Franklin Templeton, said the extent of disappointment in earnings was narrowing as catalysts for recovery gain traction. “Fiscal and monetary policy support has been tremendous, setting the stage for a strong rebound next financial year. Current earnings estimates are healthy. Even if we see some downward revisions, they may be limited this time, setting the market up well for the year ahead,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGubbi added that the market appears to be near the bottom of its earnings downgrade cycle. “For six to seven quarters now, companies have consistently fallen short of analyst expectations, leading to earnings downgrades. This could be the first quarter where we see fewer downgrades. While earnings growth hasn’t improved dramatically, expectations have been reset lower. Looking to 2026-27, mid-teens earnings growth appears achievable. Markets move on expectations. With expectations beaten down, there’s room for positivity,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe further said that consumption-focused policy measures were well-timed, coinciding with the improvement in household balance sheets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked how reform measures would impact the equity markets, Misra said investors must identify companies that can leverage these reforms to enhance profitability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve seen some signs of improvement on the discretionary side, especially in automobile sales. When you add up the direct and indirect tax breaks, households will have more disposable income, and residential equated monthly instalments will become more affordable as rates come down. The India opportunity is structural and decadal, and it will be spread across market capitalisations. There will be winners across the board,” said Misra.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tArtificial intelligence, or AI, has had an influence in the way we invest in stocks. While it helps you narrow the list of opportunities, it has not reached a point where it can replace wealth managers, points out <strong>Shankar Sharma</strong>, founder, GQuants, in a fireside chat with <strong>A K Bhattacharya</strong>.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>To what extent is your investment philosophy data- and AI-driven?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMy needle of investing has moved from being very traditional to becoming 80-90 per cent data- and AI- driven. That has been my transformation as an investor.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, I was an early adopter of AI and quant-driven thinking. And again, to clarify, it’s not that I use only AI but where it comes into play. It is giving me a breadth and scale of opportunity seeking, which I would not be able to do humanly, or even with a team.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, in a sea of 10,000 companies, for example, how do you find five, 10, 15, or 20 good ones? AI is giving me that today. Now, after that, the human part of me kicks in to further refine it down to the best five, or the best eight, or the best 10. But getting to that, it was a needle in a haystack. Now, the haystack has become much easier for me to understand. That's how I am using AI. Thus, my investment philosophy is simply that instead of taking a small number of large bets, as I would when I was a human being, because of AI, I can take a large number of small bets and a small number of large bets simultaneously.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Will AI replace humans in investing or in financial services?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think it will not happen because we human beings will prevent AI from becoming that important because it will take away our jobs. For example, if a mutual fund chief investment officer gets too much AI into his firm, tomorrow his job is in danger.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAI will have a natural check because of our vested interests and balance embedded in it. It will have a role, but to expect that everything will go from human beings and go to AI … I don't think that will happen.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>You are perceived as a contrarian. Will that change with the advent of AI?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI don’t think AI will change who you intrinsically are. But here is where the danger lies and I am mindful of that. And I try to limit the use of AI in my day-to-day life.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter using AI tools in the past one or two years, I have realised that for getting perspectives or getting data, I find you can but it (AI) will learn what you want the answer to be. So, on a topic it will start giving you answers that it senses you want.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt reads your mind on that topic and then starts feeding you answers that support your thesis. This is exactly what you don't want when you are trying to think differently and be a contrarian.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>We have not been able to get that right mix of AI and our intelligence to help navigate this difficult, complex world. How should the financial sector use AI?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAI is too new for us to form conclusions on whether it will reshape financial services in a big way. I mean, computers came and they reshaped it. AI will also reshape it. How much we have no idea, nobody can tell.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhat I do know is that AI is reshaping itself. Even AI doesn’t know where it will go five years from now. There are many flaws in it. It gives you wrong information and sometimes fabricates it. This destroys confidence.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhy were we looking at AI? Because it is better than a human in giving me correct data. But I find it gives me rubbish most of the time. So, now the process I follow is I check the same information on four different platforms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think it is imperfect right now. In fact, vastly imperfect. In some cases, dangerously imperfect.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>In addition to how one should deal with AI, what are the other things investors should bear in mind?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tReturns in global markets this year have been off the charts. It’s been one of the best years of my life as an investor because I invest globally. And I have been spoilt for choice this year, which is, on a policy basis, supposedly the most tumultuous year. So, clearly there is something markets are reading and I think markets are reading it right.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier, in investing, America was the only game in town. If you missed the American bull market, you were pretty much dead. Today, that’s not the case.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI am happy that America is slowing a bit because of its policies. The rest of the world is restructuring, reshaping. It is opening up more opportunities for me as an investor.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI do not see that as a negative at all. If anything, it is better from a portfolio management standpoint to have 15-20 good markets rather than have just one.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Any other learning from this world of uncertainty?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tI think the biggest uncertainty for an investor today should be the fact that if you (the investor) are exposed only to a single market and that market for whatever reason might have a very uncertain situation, you then have a genuine problem. Therefore, diversify your investment beyond just the comfort zone. Fortunately, tools, including AI, are available to help you do that.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The Indian economy is still predominantly dependent on oil import. What’s your view on how oil will impact the Indian financial sector, Indian stocks, and Indian markets?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExploration can reshape our oil and gas situation over the long term. In the interim, I don't think it’s in anybody’s interests, not even producers’, to have high oil prices. I think there is a consensus in the producing world that this is a good, happy price that generally keeps the world satisfied. We love bull markets in equities, gold, silver, and real estate. What is the bull market we hate? A bull market in oil. Only seven or 10 countries love it. But even at $60, I think they are pretty well prepared.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What are the reasons for the bull market in gold and silver and your advice for investors?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe can attribute and ascribe reasons to the bull market in gold. But as regards silver, I don’t think there are good reasons. Now people say that it is for industrial use. But that has always been the case. Gold is in a good place right now. But I am not saying the reason for that is people are de-dollarising and moving away. I think the opposite is true.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs gold is going up, people are moving from the dollar to gold. It’s not the other way around. That’s my view.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOther than oil, I am generally bullish on commodities. And I think there are plenty of reasons. But the reasons will change at some point in time. So, I am not a big believer in making long-term forecasts on commodities.</div></div>",

It has surpassed 1,000 registrations and achieved over $100 billion in banking assets at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt a panel discussion titled, ‘Has the GIFT-IFSC truly arrived?’ moderated by Khushboo Tiwari of Business Standard, experts said the international financial hub has evolved beyond banking, insurance, and capital markets. There are now over 35 active business segments operating in the centre.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDipesh Shah, executive director, IFSCA, said the time was ripe for GIFT City to be seen alongside global peers, such as Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Singapore.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I would definitely answer positively that GIFT City has arrived. It is now in everyone’s interest to make it comparable to Singapore and other global financial centres — rapidly and decisively,” Shah said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe financial hub is also attracting foreign companies exploring direct listings on its international exchanges.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve been doing roadshows over the past year to engage companies looking to raise between $50 million and $200 million. Even some Silicon Valley firms are in talks with us,” said V Balasubramaniam, managing director (MD) &amp; chief executive officer (CEO), NSE International Exchange.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that such offerings fill a gap for mid-sized listings that often struggle to find space in the US market, where initial public offerings (IPOs) typically exceed $1 billion in size.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNSE International Exchange recently recorded its highest-ever monthly turnover of $103 billion, surpassing the previous peak in May.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBalasubramaniam said that traders increasingly use the GIFT Nifty index as a key barometer for post-market movements and investor sentiment in Indian equities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPraising IFSCA’s market-friendly approach, Revati Kasture, CEO of CareEdge Global IFSC, said the regulatory environment has created new opportunities for financial innovation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We began operations in October 2024 by offering ratings across 39 countries. The idea was to bring an emerging-market perspective to global ratings, which has long been dominated by US-based agencies,” she said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKasture added that in 17 of those 39 markets, global rating agencies later revised their views in a direction consistent with CareEdge’s ratings — validating the model’s relevance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile favourable tax policies have helped accelerate activity at GIFT City, experts urged the government to extend the existing 10-year tax holiday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There’s a clear case for extension,” said Tushar Sachade, Partner, Price Waterhouse &amp; Co LLP. “Providing 15–20 years of certainty would offer businesses a long-term horizon and greater confidence in setting up operations.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSachade also called for clarity in the next Union Budget on taxation rules for certain categories of funds, particularly outbound schemes. “Unlike inbound structures, outbound public funds lack a defined tax regime and currently rely on the trust taxation framework. We also need clear safe-harbour norms,” he added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExperts highlighted that IFSCA operates with full policy autonomy and globally aligned regulations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If an Indian entity regulated by a domestic agency wants to operate in GIFT City, it needs a no-objection certificate from that regulator. But for foreign firms, the licensing process is direct with IFSCA,” said Shah, citing the example of a Taiwanese bank setting up operations without an India presence.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgreeing with this, Kasture added: “Some products not permitted in the domestic market, such as private credit ratings, are allowed at GIFT. The regulatory philosophy is international, not domestic.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBalasubramaniam further said that the introduction of zero-day expiry contracts on GIFT Nifty aligns with global standards and “should not be seen through a domestic-market lens.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also highlighted the proposed Global Access Provider framework, designed to enable investors and institutions in GIFT City to access a wider range of overseas assets and products.</div></div>",
