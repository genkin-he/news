By rejecting the bids, the RBI conveyed its discomfort with elevated yield levels, leading to a softening in yields by the end of the trading session.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe government was willing to sell ₹11,000 crore worth of 6.28 per cent 2032 bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond settled at 6.53 per cent, against the previous close of 6.57 per cent. Yields touched an intraday high of 6.60 per cent.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The bidding was at around 6.60 per cent, at the level at which the 10-year (yield on benchmark bond) was trading. Given that the seven-year is an illiquid bond, which is mainly with banks, the bidding was for a higher yield,” said the treasury head at a private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If the RBI had accepted it, it would have sent a wrong signal to the market, and the yield might have gone higher. That is why the RBI rejected the bids,” said the treasury head at a private bank.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe yield on the seven-year bond was trading at 6.46 per cent at the time of the auction, which later softened to settle at 6.43 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMarket participants said public sector banks were completely absent from the seven-year bond auction. Dealers said the bidding turned weak as there was a technical breakout at 6.56 per cent, and many PSU banks are already sitting on large mark-to-market losses, making them reluctant to take on additional risk. Market participants expect the yield to breach 6.60 per cent and possibly retest 6.65 per cent levels, prompting PSU banks to stay on the sidelines.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“PSU banks were completely absent from the seven-year paper. The bidding was weak. There was a technical breakout at 6.56 per cent, and they are holding large loss positions, making it riskier to buy more,” said a dealer at a primary dealership.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother market participant said banks are not adding additional bonds to their held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“After the change in the investment portfolio norms [which came into effect from April 1, 2024], banks are not willing to put more bonds in the HTM portfolio, and the seven-year bond is usually kept in the HTM of PSU banks. Given the rise in yields, nobody wants to take that risk,” said the treasury head at another private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs per the RBI’s revised norms, banks are allowed to categorise their entire bond investment portfolio into three classifications: held-to-maturity (HTM), available-for-sale (AFS), and fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The new regulations integrate the existing subcategory of held-for-trading into the last category.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter transitioning to this framework, banks are not allowed to reclassify investments between categories (viz. HTM, AFS, and FVTPL) without the approval of their boards, as well as from the regulator. The norms mandate that securities classified under the HFT subcategory within FVTPL should be fair-valued daily, whereas other securities in FVTPL will be fair-valued at least quarterly, if not more frequently.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the new norm, banks must categorise bonds as HTM on a permanent basis, with the exception of 5 per cent of the portfolio that can be withdrawn throughout the year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The company is considering using its Maraimalai Nagar facility on the outskirts of the city as an export hub, with an annual capacity of 235,000 units and production scheduled to begin in 2029.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuilding on a letter of intent signed in September 2024, Ford representatives and the Tamil Nadu government on Friday formalised a memorandum of understanding (MoU) setting out a strategy to tap into India’s “manufacturing prowess”. Senior Ford executives met Chief Minister M K Stalin as part of the agreement, which is likely to see the facility play a key role vis-à-vis the company’s Southeast Asian markets.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MoU complements Ford India’s existing infrastructure for producing and exporting engines. “We are pleased to advance our plans and confirm the Chennai plant’s vital role in Ford’s manufacturing network,” said Jeff Marentic, president of Ford’s international markets group.

The site’s location, less than 50 km from Chennai port and 74 km from Ennore port, offers strong logistical advantages, with Bengaluru also just 320 km away by road.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the time of its exit, Ford India had reported accumulated losses of around $2 billion over a decade and held less than a 2 per cent share of the country’s passenger vehicle market through models such as the EcoSport and Endeavour SUVs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This is not just the restart of manufacturing at the existing Ford facility,” Rajaa said. “It is the state taking yet another step towards the future of the automotive industry with the production of nextgen engines. We remain committed to supporting Ford's operations here.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe new investment is expected to create more than 600 direct jobs, along with indirect employment across the automotive supply chain. Ford currently employs about 12,000 people at its global business operations unit in Tamil Nadu.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company said it continues to serve more than one million customers in India through service, aftermarket parts, and warranty support.

The upgradation trend from soaps to facewash, supported by higher disposable incomes and changing grooming preferences, is expected to sustain strong momentum in the coming years,” the release added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are delighted to welcome the Muuchstac brand to Godrej Consumer Products. The brand’s strong resonance among younger consumers, high profitability, and proven digital execution model make it a powerful addition to our personal care portfolio. This acquisition enhances our participation in the fast-growing men’s grooming segment and supports our vision of building a future-ready, innovation-led GCPL,” said Sudhir Sitapati, managing director and chief executive officer at GCPL, in the release.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonak Bagadia and Vishal Lohia, founders of Muuchstac, said they look forward to the business scaling up in line with their vision of redefining men’s skincare in India and added that they will work closely with the team at Godrej for the same.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the July–September quarter, GCPL’s consolidated net profit fell 6.5 per cent to ₹459.3 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts net sales grew 4.3 per cent to ₹3,825.1 crore.

Despite these headwinds, our India business, excluding soaps, has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth, reflecting the strength of our core portfolio and execution.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said that the recent GST rate reduction is a welcome structural reform that will strengthen long-term consumer demand.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs warned by the company ahead of its earnings, Sitapati said in the release, “However, this transition led to short-term trade disruptions as the channel adjusted to new pricing and cleared old inventory, particularly impacting soaps and hair colour. Despite this, we continue to gain market share in soaps and other key categories.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that in October, the company entered the ₹3,000-crore toilet cleaner category, which is growing at strong double digits.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our new brand, Godrej Spic, has been launched in select South Indian states, priced competitively at ₹79 for 500 ml, marking an important step in expanding our home care portfolio,” he said.</div></div>",
