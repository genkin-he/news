By rejecting the bids, the RBI conveyed its discomfort with elevated yield levels, leading to a softening in yields by the end of the trading session.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe government had planned to sell ₹11,000 crore worth of 6.28 per cent 2032 bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond settled at 6.53 per cent, down from the previous close of 6.57 per cent, after touching an intraday high of 6.6 per cent.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The bidding was around 6.6 per cent — roughly the same level at which the 10-year benchmark was trading. Given that the seven-year is an illiquid bond, mainly held by banks, bidders sought a higher yield,” said the treasury head at a private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If the RBI had accepted those bids, it would have sent the wrong signal to the market and pushed yields even higher. That’s why the RBI rejected them,” the treasury head added.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the time of the auction, the seven-year bond was trading at 6.46 per cent, later easing to 6.43 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMarket participants said public-sector banks (PSBs) were completely absent from the auction. Dealers said that bidding weakened after a technical breakout at 6.56 per cent, with many PSBs already sitting on large mark-to-market losses, making them reluctant to take on additional risk. Some expect yields to breach 6.6 per cent and possibly retest 6.65 per cent, prompting state-run banks to remain on the sidelines.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“PSBs were completely absent from the seven-year paper. The bidding was weak after the technical breakout at 6.56 per cent.

The seven-year bond is usually kept in the HTM book of PSBs, but with yields rising, nobody wants to take that risk,” said the treasury head at another private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the RBI’s revised framework, banks must categorise their entire bond investment portfolio into three buckets —HTM, available-for-sale (AFS), and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The new rules merge the earlier held-for-trading sub-category into FVTPL.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBanks are no longer allowed to reclassify investments between HTM, AFS, and FVTPL without board and regulatory approval. Securities under the held-for-trading sub-category within FVTPL must be fair-valued daily, while other FVTPL securities are to be valued at least quarterly, or more frequently if required.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the new norms, bonds classified as HTM must remain there permanently, except for up to 5 per cent of the portfolio that can be shifted during the year.</div></div>",

It had in June signed an MoU with Hindustan Copper to collaborate in copper and critical minerals.
