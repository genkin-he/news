Trump was interviewed by CBS' Norah O'Donnell Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine. But he has signalled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place. O'Donnell, the former CBS Evening News anchor, is not one of the show's regular correspondents.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump walked out of a 60 Minutes interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl shortly before the 2020 election, complaining of bias, and his team released an unedited transcript of the conversation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDespite invitations, he did not agree to a 60 Minutes interview during the 2024 election campaign. But he complained that the newsmagazine's interview with Harris, his Democratic opponent, was edited deceptively in order to make her look good.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tCBS News strongly denied any wrongdoing, but Trump filed a lawsuit against the company. Paramount decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle the case this summer, shortly before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount's merger with Ellison's Skydance Media.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the wake of the Trump lawsuit, 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens resigned this past spring, saying that it was becoming clear that he could no longer run the programme independently.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSince taking over at Paramount, Ellison has sent signals of a closer relationship with Trump. He hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tParamount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss reportedly had a role in booking the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and aide Steve Witkoff for a 60 Minutes interview two weeks ago, talking about the peace deal in Gaza.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFlying back from the Middle East on Oct 12, Trump told reporters that Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing.</p><p></p></div>",
