The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to practice genuine multilateralism, according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xi, Lee discuss North Korea</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tChinese state media reports on the Xi-Lee meeting didn't immediately carry any North Korea-related comments by Xi.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Wi Sung-lac, Lee's national security director, said Lee during the meeting outlined his strategy for achieving denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and requested a constructive Chinese role to help realise the resumption of talks with North Korea.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tXi replied that he would continue his efforts to help resolve issues involving the Korean Peninsula and promote peace and stability here, Wi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina is North Korea's traditional ally and economic pipeline, but there are still questions about how much leverage it has on its impoverished neighbour. China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing UN sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against US influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about its daydream of realising North Korea's denuclearisation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea, said earlier Saturday he would take more active preemptive steps to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said South Korea and China also signed several agreements on jointly combating online scams, expanding a bilateral free trade deal and renewing a currency swap deal that expired last month.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders call for greater cooperation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAfter two days of talks, APEC leaders vowed greater cooperation to tackle shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by rising protectionism and trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir joint statement declared that the APEC leaders \"acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenges.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, it says.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea's National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting free and open trade, which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC's mission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It wasn't possible to leave that out entirely, said Min.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe joint declaration also said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that's free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile the summit's opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday's meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAPEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, ageing populations and accelerated urbanisation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that investing in China is investing in the future.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEstablished in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration. But the region now faces challenges such as the US-China rivalry, supply chain disruptions, ageing populations and the impact of AI on jobs.</p><p></p></div>",

According to the report, the goal is to prevent the former prince from overspending and help him spend his life as a commoner.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talks between Andrew’s representatives and the King’s aides are still ongoing, the plan is expected to be finalised soon.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Andrew to vacate royal palace after Christmas</strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAndrew is expected to remain at the Royal Lodge until after Christmas before moving to Sandringham. Though the process of surrendering his long-term lease could take time, palace officials say the transition is moving “as quickly as practicable.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite losing his royal titles, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne, but he no longer performs public duties and has no official royal role.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Titles officially removed</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLast week, Buckingham Palace confirmed that King Charles had begun the formal process to remove Andrew’s titles, styles, and honours. This means Andrew can no longer use the titles 'Prince' or 'His Royal Highness.' He has also been removed from the official roll of the peerage, and the King will issue royal documents to make the decision permanent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Why was Andrew removed?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAndrew’s removal stemmed from his connection to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. According to media reports, Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s trafficking victims, accused Andrew of sexually assaulting her when she was 17. Although Andrew denied the allegations, his reputation suffered heavily.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe King’s decision followed renewed public attention after Giuffre’s memoir, published earlier this year, repeated her claims. Palace insiders said the move was “necessary” to protect the monarchy’s reputation, even though Andrew continues to deny any wrongdoing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a statement, the palace said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of all forms of abuse.” The British government also supported the King’s decision, calling it appropriate and sound.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

In less than a week, Andhra Pradesh has been battered by a series of calamities, which included a bus inferno in Kurnool district that left 19 dead, at least Rs 5,244-crore loss inflicted by cyclonic storm 'Montha' during this week and now the Srikakulam temple tragedy.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe last week of October which extended into November, proved to be one of the deadliest for the southern state in recent times, with natural disasters and temple accidents claiming dozens of lives and leaving widespread destruction.</p><p></p></div>",
