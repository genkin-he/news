The new target implies a potential 34 per cent upside from current levels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating and raise SOTP-based TP marginally to ₹560 (from ₹550 earlier). In our view, disciplined execution and improving visibility on breakeven will be key catalysts for the stock to do well from here,” said Abhishek Bhandari and Karan Nain of Nomura, in a note dated October 31, 2025.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\n<strong><em>Meanwhile, here are the top three reasons behind the target price hike:</em></strong></h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tStrong growth in food delivery business</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwiggy’s food delivery (FD) arm continued its solid performance in the September quarter (Q2FY26), driven by sustained order growth and operational efficiency. The company’s gross order value (GOV) rose 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) and 19 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y), in line with Nomura’s expectations and ahead of Zomato’s 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth in the same period. Monthly transacting users (MTU) climbed 5.7 per cent sequentially to 17.2 million, reflecting improving engagement on the platform.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe take rate, including delivery charges, inched up 10 basis points (bps) Q-o-Q to 25.8 per cent, while contribution margin (CM) remained steady at 7.3 per cent, despite competitive pressures such as lower subscription fees and reduced minimum order values. Adjusted Ebitda margin, as a percentage of GOV, improved 44 basis points Q-o-Q to 2.8 per cent. Nomura highlighted that Swiggy’s difference between GOV and net order value (NOV) growth was only around 0.5 per cent, compared to Zomato’s ~4 per cent gap, suggesting better pricing and volume alignment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura expects Swiggy’s FD segment to maintain its momentum, projecting 19-20 per cent Y-o-Y growth in GOV over FY26–27, with contribution margins expanding modestly to 7.5-7.7 per cent. This sustained growth trajectory, coupled with operational discipline, underpins analysts’ confidence in Swiggy’s long-term value creation potential.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tFund-raising to strengthen quick commerce business</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwiggy’s management has announced plans to raise around ₹10,000 crore to bolster its quick commerce (QC) arm, a segment that continues to face heightened competition. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura noted that the company’s fund-raising efforts are timely, given the dynamic nature of the QC space and peers’ aggressive capital deployment. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRival Zepto recently secured $450 million in new funding, while Zomato’s Blinkit holds about ₹20,000 crore in cash reserves. Strengthening the balance sheet through this capital infusion will boost Swiggy’s ability to invest in growth, logistics, and technology while sustaining its competitive positioning.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tBetter visibility on profitability</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura believes disciplined execution, operational efficiency, and a clearer path toward breakeven are key catalysts for Swiggy’s stock performance in the coming quarters. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage stressed that improving contribution margins and a gradual ramp-up in QC economics provide better visibility on profitability. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Nomura also flagged risks such as intensified competition in the QC business and a potential macroeconomic slowdown that could temper order growth in the online food delivery segment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "id": 125103100112,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Alisha Sachdev</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord Motor Co plans to invest about ₹3,250 crore ($370 million) in India to make new engines, a person familiar with the matter said, signaling renewed confidence in the country and defying Donald Trump’s promotion of American manufacturing as it reopens a factory closed four years ago.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Maraimalai Nagar manufacturing site in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu will be retooled to make high-end engines for export markets with an annual capacity of over 200,000 units, said the person, asking not to be named as the plans are private. The engines will not be exported to the US, but it’s unclear which countries they will be sent to, the person said, adding an announcement is expected as early as this week.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US automaker, which first signaled its interest in resuming local production in India a year ago, has been preparing the investment for months against a backdrop of heightened tensions between New Delhi and Washington. Trump placed a 50 per cent tariff on Indian imports earlier this year in a trade standoff, and has lashed out at the Asian country’s purchase of Russian oil. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe move comes even as Trump made boosting manufacturing in the US — especially where the automotive industry is concerned — a signature policy goal. Ford caught flack from the president during his first term for a plan to increase output outside the US, but more recently won praise from him after announcing major investments at its domestic plants. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord declined to comment. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord’s decision reflects renewed confidence in India as a manufacturing base from Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley and comes as it pivots from a previous focus on electric vehicles. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company first set up manufacturing near Chennai in 1995 and added a second plant in Sanand, Gujarat, in 2015. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShortly after becoming CEO in 2020, Farley pulled the plug on a deal with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. that would have kept Ford vehicles on Indian roads. He abandoned the market altogether less than a year later, saying it could no longer pour capital into marginal markets like India and Brazil that provided little or no return. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBy by the time it exited, Ford racked up losses totaling over $2 billion. It ultimately sold off the Sanand vehicle plant to Tata Motors, which now builds EVs there. In 2020, Ford’s chief US rival, General Motors Co, also ceased production in India, three years after shifting to an export-only business model. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMore recently, other US companies have been building up their manufacturing presence in India, despite the political tension. Trump singled out Apple Inc. in May for its decision to manufacture in India, but the tech giant has since ramped up iPhone production across five Indian factories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTamil Nadu, where Ford plans to restart its old facility, is one of India’s largest industrialized states and a longtime automaking hub. It’s home to manufacturing facilities operated by Hyundai Motor Co., Renault SA, and BMW AG.</div></div>",

Despite affecting millions, misinformation about causes, symptoms, and treatment continues to circulate online and offline. From weight gain worries to misguided supplement use, doctors say that myths often delay diagnosis and proper care.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis <em>Fact-check Friday</em>, we separate medical fact from fiction with insights from Dr Jatin Kumar Majhi, Consultant – Diabetology and Endocrinology, Manipal Hospital, Bhubaneswar.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can only women get thyroid problems?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Only women get thyroid problems</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to Dr Majhi, it is true that thyroid disorders are more common in women, but men are not immune. He explains that in men, subtle symptoms like low energy or mood changes are often missed, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does thyroid disease always cause weight gain?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease always causes weight gain</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Not always. While hypothyroidism (a sluggish thyroid) can slow metabolism and add a few kilos, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) can cause weight loss. In reality, most thyroid issues do not drastically change weight, and any gain can be managed with proper treatment, diet, and movement.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can you stop thyroid medication once you feel better?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You can stop thyroid medication once you feel better</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Dr Majhi calls this a dangerous assumption. Thyroid medication controls the condition and not cure it. Stopping treatment abruptly can make symptoms worse or cause a hormonal crash. Always speak to your doctor before changing or stopping any thyroid therapy, he advised.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will iodine supplements cure thyroid problems?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Taking iodine supplements cures thyroid problems</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to Dr Majhi, most people already get enough iodine through their diet and <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/salt-myths-fact-check-daily-sodium-health-risks-125100300020_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">iodised salt</a>. He cautions that too much iodine can actually worsen conditions like Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. Supplements are not a cure and can backfire.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do all thyroid nodules mean cancer?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>All thyroid nodules mean cancer</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Over 90 per cent of thyroid nodules are non-cancerous. Still, every lump deserves attention. The right approach is to get it checked soon. Early detection ensures peace of mind and, if needed, early treatment.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does thyroid disease always show visible swelling?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease always shows visible swelling or a neck bulge</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>The thyroid does not always make itself known. Many thyroid disorders are “silent”, with vague signs like fatigue, dry skin, or irregular periods. Blood tests and scans are the only reliable ways to confirm what’s going on under the skin.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can herbal supplements replace thyroid medication?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Natural or herbal supplements can replace thyroid medication</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>“No herbal remedy or “detox” has been scientifically proven to replace prescribed thyroid hormones. In fact, some supplements can interfere with medication or even cause side effects if taken unsupervised,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can thyroid disease make pregnancy impossible?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disease makes pregnancy impossible</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Dr Majhi says that most women with thyroid disorders can conceive and have healthy pregnancies, provided they are properly treated and monitored. The key is regular hormone checks and medical supervision.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Is it impossible to lose weight with hypothyroidism?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You can’t lose weight if you have hypothyroidism</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Weight loss might be slower, but it is possible. Once thyroid levels are stabilised, a balanced diet, protein intake, and regular exercise work as effectively as they do for anyone else. “Blaming every stubborn kilo on the thyroid is an easy trap,” says Dr Majhi.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Are thyroid disorders rare in India?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Thyroid disorders are rare</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>India is one of the global hotspots for thyroid disease. Recent data suggest that self-reported thyroid disorders among Indians aged 15–49 years rose to 2.9 per cent in 2019–21 (National Family Health Survey-V). Other smaller studies suggest a broader prevalence of 10–12 per cent or higher in adult populations. However, deficits in national biomarker surveys mean the true figure may be higher. Because symptoms often mimic other issues, millions remain undiagnosed, silently dealing with fatigue and mood swings they can’t explain.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Will cutting out gluten cure thyroid disease?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Cutting out gluten will cure thyroid disease</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Unless you have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet helps thyroid health. It can help some autoimmune thyroid patients, but for most, it’s unnecessary and nutritionally restrictive.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Does a normal TSH mean your thyroid is fine?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>If your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, your thyroid is perfectly fine</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/health-checks-for-mothers-over-40-tests-to-preventive-care-guide-125060900286_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">TSH</a> is just one piece of the puzzle. Dr Majhi says that for a full picture, doctors also look at Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibodies. A normal TSH does not always mean everything is in balance, especially if you are still feeling off.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Do thyroid medicines make you dependent?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Once you start medication, you will become dependent</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>According to the doctors, medicines like Levothyroxine aren’t addictive and simply replace what your body can’t make. It doesn’t fix the root cause, but it keeps your metabolism and hormones stable.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Can apple cider vinegar or turmeric cure thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>Home remedies like apple cider vinegar or turmeric can fix thyroid issues</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>While these may support general wellness, they can’t balance thyroid hormones. They might help digestion or inflammation, but they’re no match for medical therapy. Use them as lifestyle support, not substitutes.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Should you avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues?</strong></h2>\n<div>\n<strong>Myth: </strong>You must avoid exercise if you have thyroid issues</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Fact: </strong>Quite the opposite! Dr Majhi says exercise actually helps stabilise metabolism, improve mood, and manage weight. Unless your thyroid levels are severely uncontrolled, movement is medicine. Just tailor the intensity under your doctor’s guidance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr Majhi stresses that thyroid disorders are common, treatable, and misunderstood. What makes them tricky is how they usually mimic everyday fatigue or stress. That is why periodic screening and trusted medical advice matter more than social media “cures.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The thyroid gland may be small, but its impact on overall health is enormous. Understanding the facts and not falling for myths is the first step towards control,” he says.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div></div><div><blockquote class=\"blockquoteBG styleQ1\" style=\"background-color:#FFF5EB;padding:8px;overflow:hidden\">\n<p>\n<strong>About Fact-Check Friday</strong></p>\n<p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tMisinformation in health can be more harmful than the illness itself.

Retain ‘Buy’ with an SotP-based TP of ₹413 (earlier ₹401), at 2.5x FY27E SA book + NTPC Green at a 30 per cent discount to CMP (₹105),” said Subhadip Mitra, Vikram Datwani, Mahir Moondra and Divyam Sureka of Nuvama, in a note dated October 30, 2025.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tSteady quarterly performance</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor the September quarter of FY26 (Q2FY26), NTPC’s standalone adjusted profit after tax (PAT) rose 7.5 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to around ₹4,500 crore, driven primarily by a sharp 66 per cent jump in other income and lower interest expenses, which are passed through in regulated tariffs. Operating performance was largely in line, though weak power demand led to a dip in plant load factor (PLF) to 66 per cent versus 72.3 per cent a year ago. This weighed on core RoE, which slipped to 14.4 per cent from 15.8 per cent Y-o-Y despite a 6 per cent rise in regulated equity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn a consolidated basis, profit remained flat Y-o-Y at ₹5,230 crore as lower dividends from subsidiaries and joint ventures offset a notable improvement in subsidiary-level profits (₹1,150 crore vs ₹840 crore last year). Management guided that fixed cost under-recovery, which stood at ₹625 crore in the first half, should decline to ₹250 crore by Q4FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tExpansion momentum intact</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNTPC’s group generation declined around 6 per cent Y-o-Y during the quarter due to subdued demand. However, capacity expansion remains on track with 33GW under construction (17.3GW thermal, 2.2GW hydro, and the rest renewable). The company has revised its commissioning guidance to 9.2GW for FY26 (2.8GW thermal, 1GW hydro, 5.4GW renewables) and about 10.5GW for FY27. Most upcoming projects are housed under subsidiaries or joint ventures, suggesting that consolidated earnings will capture most of the future growth. NTPC targets over 60GW of operational renewable capacity by FY32, up from 7.4GW as of September 2025. The company also declared an interim dividend of ₹2.75 per share for Q2FY26.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tForay into nuclear, storage</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNTPC is expanding into nuclear power through its Ashvini JV with NPCIL, which is developing the 4×700MW Mahi Banswara project in Rajasthan. The foundation stone was laid in September 2025, with additional sites identified through state MoUs. The company’s pumped storage portfolio stands at 21.2GW, including 11GW directly under NTPC and 10.4GW through THDC and NEEPCO.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, NTPC has been allocated a 5,000MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) under the viability gap funding scheme to enhance thermal plant efficiency and ensure power supply during non-solar hours.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tFor an America First president, Donald Trump seemed to love his whirlwind five days skipping across Asia a reflection of a White House that is increasingly focused on the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Trump stepped off Air Force One on Sunday for his first stop in Malaysia, he danced with local performers who had greeted him on the red carpet. In Japan, he helicoptered to a mammoth aircraft carrier for a speech with the country's prime minister. And South Korea gave him a gold medal and crown as gifts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBack home in Washington, the federal government was shut down as Trump's poll numbers remain low, and it's unclear how much Trump's trip will resonate with voters consumed by other concerns at home.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tYet on the last night of his trip, Trump was overheard at a state dinner talking about how much he enjoyed meetings with his foreign counterparts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat was a great meeting, Trump said. They're all great meetings. This was a great meeting. We had a fantastic meeting.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHad a president who once used the term globalist as a slur suddenly found the fun in being a little bit globalist? He definitely likes the international deal making, the parties in his honour, the praise from other leaders and the possibility of leaving his mark on the wider world.</p>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/world-news/donald-trump-xi-jinping-meeting-us-china-tariff-drop-fentanyl-curbs-125103000356_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump drops China tariffs from 57% to 47% after meeting Xi in South Korea</a></strong></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe president sees diplomacy as a way to fulfil his domestic agenda of creating factory jobs, said Carla Sands, who was the US ambassador to Denmark during Trump's first term and is now chair of the foreign policy initiative at the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tPresident Trump is working as fast as possible to reindustrialise America, bring jobs back home, and secure better trade deals for the American people and businesses, Sands said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe ebullience abroad also reflects the mood of a president who has struck economic deals and helped smooth relations between warring nations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe helped to affirm a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand. There's a detailed list of nearly $500 billion in investment commitments from Japan. And South Korea pledged $150 billion to help revive American shipbuilding, including a project to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine on top of $200 billion in investments over a decade to the US.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not globalism to go to other countries and stand up for America, said Hogan Gidley, a former White House aide who travelled to Asia and other foreign destinations with Trump in his first term. When Trump travels, he makes sure the globe is fully aware that this president is going to stand up for the American people first, Gidley said, making it the exact opposite of globalism.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs for the dancing?<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tLook, when you're scoring touchdowns, it's OK to dance in the end zone, Gidley said. And this president is scoring touchdowns and running up the score.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMany Trump voters believed they were electing a president who would focus on them instead of distant countries. But Trump in his second term is increasingly finding it easier to sell the idea of America with jaunts to Asia and the Middle East.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/world-news/us-judge-blocks-trump-admin-from-firing-workers-during-govt-shutdown-125102900031_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">US judge blocks Trump admin from firing workers during govt shutdown</a></strong></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe shift in tone reflects foreign governments' strenuous efforts to keep Trump happy, like stationing American-made vehicles near him in Tokyo and featuring US-raised beef on the menu.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump is increasingly showing confidence that he can play on the global stage, instead of grinding metaphorical axes as he did during his first term by attacking NATO and finding ways to intimidate and frustrate allies such as Angela Merkel, then the chancellor of Germany.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe appears to believe in his skills as a one-on-one negotiator with world leaders, said Jasen Castillo, a professor with a focus on national security at Texas A&amp;M University. All of this suggests that his foreign policy ventures are genuine.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tStill, it's not always clear what Trump is trying to achieve, other than a chance to declare victory. Some of his trade talks have led to foreign countries promising investments, but not necessarily the careful negotiations on which durable coalitions are built.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhat can confuse observers is that he lacks a consistent, coherent world view, Castillo added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US president in Asia was hardly the grimacing presence he's been at times in the Oval Office, where he's objected to the support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sought in the war against Russia and chastised post-apartheid South Africans on their treatment of white Afrikaners.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Asia, it was a lovefest. Trump said Southeast Asian nations had spectacular leaders, the new Japanese prime minister was a winner and the South Korean president could go down as the greatest of them all.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRather than complaining about foreign countries ripping off America, he told business leaders that the best deals are deals that work for everybody.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump was similarly effusive after sitting down on Thursday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping shortly before returning to Washington.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump seems to enjoy doing foreign policy on his own terms. He prizes bold shows of force, like attacking nuclear sites in Iran and boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe minimises participation in lengthy multilateral meetings that can require more listening than talking.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tArriving at the summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Trump offered a spot in the armoured presidential limousine to Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was thrilled to join him in the vehicle nicknamed The Beast.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the president arrives, he asked me to join him in the car, Anwar later recalled in a speech. I said, That's against the security and protocol rules, and he was delighted to break the rules.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe White House said that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi planned to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, with Takaichi telling him she was so impressed and inspired by Trump's commitment to world peace and stability.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSouth Korean President Lee Jae Myung said Trump will be recognised forever in the history of humanity if he could bring his peacemaker skills to ending the military standoff with North Korea, before complimenting him for US stock indexes hitting a record high.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEven the far more reserved Xi seemed to suggest that Trump's policies behind elevating America were also good for China.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI always believe that China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to 'Make America Great Again', Xi said through a translator.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the White House is trumpeting the results of Trump's trip back home, it's unclear how much his foreign policy actions mattered to a country worried about inflation staying high.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGoing into the 2025 elections Tuesday with a mayoral race in New York City and governors' elections in Virginia and New Jersey, many Americans are harbouring deep anxieties about Trump's leadership. The monthlong government shutdown is starting to cause pain with missed paychecks and government food aid no longer being available to millions of families.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAbout 6 in 10 US adults disapprove of Trump's performance as president, according to an October poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump told his audiences in Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo and South Korea that America has never been better.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe're literally sort of an inspiration to a lot of other countries, Trump said.</p><p></p></div>",

Toyota sold over 300,000 vehicles in India last year, of which about 60 per cent were Suzuki models, and has a growing share of exports to countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tToyota's capacity expansion will happen in phases, but once complete, it will be able to produce over 1 million cars a year in India between its two manufacturing sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe carmaker's hybrids like the Urban Cruiser Hyryder SUV and Innova Hycross MPV have helped it carve out a lead in alternate-fuel vehicles - something it plans to build on with new product launches, the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAt its new plant in western Aurangabad city, Toyota's first product is expected to be an SUV which will come with multiple powertrains including gasoline, hybrid and electric and which will be sold in India and exported, the sources said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to Toyota's $3 billion investment, Suzuki announced in August that it would invest $8 billion in India over the next five to six years. Hyundai Motor said this month, it will invest $5 billion to expand its Indian manufacturing and research operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(Reporting by Aditi Shah in Tokyo, Additional reporting by Daniel Leussink; Editing by David Dolan and Edwina Gibbs)</p><p></p></div>",
