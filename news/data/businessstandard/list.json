The segment in FY25 contributed around Rs 10,500 crore to the media and entertainment sector’s revenue of Rs 1.45 trillion, according to PwC India. The amount is almost 7 per cent of the industry’s overall spending. While movie ticket sales are a larger source of ticketing platforms’ revenue, live events became crucial after Ahmedabad in January became the venue for Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres World Tour biggest concert.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRahul Ganjoo, chief executive officer (CEO) of going-out platform District by Zomato, said that movie tickets will continue anchoring ticketing revenue due to its volume and frequency, while live events will grow disproportionately. The platform’s October-December lineup includes Rolling Loud, the world’s largest hip-hop festival featuring over 30 international and homegrown artists; footballer Lionel Messi’s GOAT India Tour, and tours by Spanish singer-songwriter Enrique Iglesias and Senegalese-American musician Akon, who featured in Hindi song Chammak Challo.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBookMyShow, a ticketing and entertainment platform which was the partner for the Coldplay and Guns N’ Roses concerts, expects demand for live events to continue. Naman Pugalia, chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, said Linkin Park, Playboi Carti and The Lumineers will perform in Delhi NCR next year. Mumbai will host Sunburn 2025 and later Lollapalooza India 2026, and Bandland 2026.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ticket sales for live events in India now make up for almost 25 to 30 per cent of total ticketing revenue, with spending on live events growing at a much faster rate than on movies,” said Rajesh Sethi, partner and leader, media, entertainment and sports, PwC India.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This shift is because more people want real experiences like concerts and sports rather than just watching only films. For ticketing platforms, live-event ticketing has become a key growth area and is nearly equal to or even ahead of movie ticket sales in terms of strategic importance. What was once a niche is now turning into a key revenue stream, joining digital media, OTT [over-the-top media], and gaming. Live entertainment segment’s ability to deliver memorable experiences, connect emotionally with audiences, and attract brands makes it a valuable and growing part of the entertainment mix” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSethi, however, noted that growth could be constrained due to limited venues, regulatory permissions, high costs, and poor transport infrastructure. Earlier in October, Sanjay Jaju, secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said that the government is looking at doubling India’s concert economy. He also announced that the government is revamping the India Cine Hub website to create a single-window platform for concerts, streamlining the process of securing the various permissions required.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Deloitte India, the live events industry is by various estimates valued between Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore. Recognising its potential, the government in August formed a joint working group dedicated to promoting and supporting the live events industry, said Chandrashekar Mantha, partner, media and entertainment sector leader, Deloitte India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“[Music band] Passenger’s intimate three-city tour is set to strike a soulful chord with fans, while Jon Batiste’s India debut will bring a touch of Grammy-winning brilliance to the mix. Guitar legend Tom Morello’s highly anticipated arrival as part of Bandland on Tour will further amplify the excitement, alongside Post Malone’s first-ever show in the Northeast (Guwahati), marking an expansion of India’s live music footprint beyond traditional metros,” said Pugalia, adding that its recent partnership with RuPay marks a significant step in reimagining access and engagement for today’s culture-forward consumer.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDistrict by Zomato has recorded year-on-year growth in live events, driven by an expanding portfolio of ticketed intellectual property and curated experiences.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ticket sales have surged in parallel, signalling strong consumer appetite for premium entertainment and world-class production. While Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi NCR remain key markets, tier-II cities are emerging as significant growth drivers. This momentum stems from a richer event calendar featuring more international artists and festivals, coupled with a clear premiumisation trend: audiences are increasingly willing to pay for top-tier talent and venues,” Ganjoo noted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSethi and Ganjoo both emphasised that the segment is seeing a notable shift from passive sponsorship and branding to immersive collaborations starting from pre-media buzz to interactive promotions for concert attendees, which is beyond just logo visibility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Brand participation in live events has surged, driven by their cultural relevance and unmatched experiential impact. Categories like beverages and FMCG are leading this charge, alongside a notable influx of fintech players like HSBC, who are heavily investing in live entertainment as a key engagement channel. These brands recognise live events as powerful storytelling platforms that foster authentic consumer connections, particularly with younger, affluent audiences,” Ganjoo said.</div></div>",

The profit growth is on the back of revenue growth, “significant operating and financial leverage”, the company said.</div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLodha’s revenue (from operations) increased 44.7 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 3,798.5 crore. The revenue topped the Bloomberg analysts’ poll estimate of Rs 3,158.7 crore. Meanwhile, the profit also beat the estimate of Rs 547.6 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) for the quarter stood at Rs 1,310 crore, up 37 per cent Y-o-Y.

This was the company’s best-ever Q2 in terms of pre-sales.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLodha’s collections during the same period stood at Rs 3,480 crore, up 13 per cent Y-o-Y.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDuring the quarter under review, Lodha added one new project in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region with a gross development value (GDV) of Rs 2,300 crore to its portfolio in Q2FY26. With this, the company achieved its full-year business guidance of Rs 25,000 crore in H1FY26 itself. It further has a robust business addition pipeline. In Q1FY26, the company added five new projects across the MMR, Pune, and Bengaluru with a GDV of Rs 22,700 crore.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAbhishek Lodha, managing director and chief executive officer, Lodha Developers, said, “We find strong market momentum with continuing strength in walk-ins and conversions. Our non-launch weekly sales are now approaching Rs 300 crore per week, showcasing the strength of our well-diversified spread of projects. With significant launches planned in H2, following the resolution of the environmental clearance process by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in August, we are on track to deliver our full-year pre-sales guidance of Rs 21,000 crore.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn the first half of FY26 (H1FY26), Lodha recorded pre-sales of Rs 9,020 crore, up 8 per cent Y-o-Y, while collections for the same period stood at Rs 5,760 crore, up 10 per cent Y-o-Y.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Low home ownership levels, rising household incomes, low mortgage rates, and improving affordability have created an unprecedented opportunity for organised, branded developers like us. At Lodha, we see these trends not just as favourable market dynamics but as the foundation of our long-term strategy. Our focus on design excellence, superior execution, and customer-centricity positions us to capture this demand and deliver sustainable top-line growth of 20 per cent year after year,” Lodha added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn H1FY26, the company’s revenue grew 33.22 per cent to Rs 7,290.2 crore, while its profit grew 62.92 per cent to Rs 1,463.4 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAdditionally, the company’s net debt as of September 30, 2025, stood at Rs 5,370 crore, while its net debt-to-equity ratio stood at 0.25x, below its ceiling of 0.5x.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSequentially, the company’s revenue grew 8.8 per cent, while its profit grew 15.4 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDuring the quarter, the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth Rs 30,000 crore with the government of Maharashtra for setting up a data centre park in Palava, a planned urban township near Dombivli in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
