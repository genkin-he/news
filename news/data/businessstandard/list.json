Rather than chasing unrealistic totals, they focused on building competitive scores that proved sufficient on sluggish surfaces. Bangladesh’s batting, however, has been their major concern, with repeated collapses while chasing moderate targets. Their inability to handle the mounting scoreboard pressure has cost them dearly.

This story of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) is told here through the biography of its second principal, Jagat Murari, who, in its first decade, took the institution to its greatest heights.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe author, Radha Chadha, is Murari’s daughter. She has shaped her narrative by using a treasure trove of journals, official papers, news reports and photographs that Murari left behind in three packed cupboards. She has given life to these documents by interviewing more than a hundred people over the last 10 years — students, teachers, officials, journalists — who have given first-hand accounts of their life at the institute.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAfter over a decade as a documentary filmmaker, Murari came to the institute in 1961 and became its head a year later. This was in every sense a pioneering venture — no such institute existed in India and those working in the film industry usually had no formal training. Ms Chadha describes her father as “an idealistic man consumed by a passion to create the school of his dreams” as he painstakingly developed the syllabus, appointed faculty, and acquired expensive facilities for the diverse courses.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe students who joined in this early period had hardly any knowledge of cinema. Murari’s instruction to his students was simple; they had “to think in original terms and give full expression to their individual personalities” and develop their own “directorial style”. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe students enthusiastically devoured films such as Battleship Potemkin, Citizen Kane, Bicycle Thieves, Rashomon, Wild Strawberries, Breathless, La Dolce Vita, that had been made by some of the greatest directors of all time — Sergei Eisenstein, Orson Welles, Vittorio De Sica, Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Jean Luc Godard, and Federico Fellini — besides the masterpieces of Indian masters Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, and Mrinal Sen. Many of these stalwarts visited the FTII and held lectures.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe impact of this teaching and exposure changed the face of Indian cinema as the institute’s graduates — Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Girish Kasaravalli, John Abraham — shaped the “new wave” with films reflecting a creative understanding of the human spirit along with a command over the latest cinematic technology. The institute’s graduates also impacted mainstream (Hindi) cinema and regional cinema; these included: Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Subhash Ghai, and actors such as Jaya Bachchan,  Shatrughan  Sinha, Sadhu Meher, Shabana Azmi, Mithun Chakraborty, Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, and many more.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tMs Chadha also discusses some of the issues that unsettled the institute. Towards the end of the first decade, direction students, heavily influenced by some aspects of world cinema, insisted they would not use the acting students in their diploma films — the latter, they said, were influenced by mainstream cinema and hence not suited for their endeavours that required “authenticity”, largely by using non-professional actors. This led to frequent unrest and strikes, the last of which caused Murari’s departure from the institute in 1971.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThis also caused a prolonged malaise in the institution as a clueless government deployed one ill-chosen head after another, which only worsened the situation. Administration collapsed, examinations were seriously delayed, diploma films remained incomplete, teaching was deficient — and admissions dropped drastically. The government sent Murari back to the institute to improve matters in 1976, but it was too late. He described the situation as “someone [having] taken aim and wielded a wrecking ball” at the institution he had so lovingly nurtured.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe last 50 pages make very painful reading. The film institute now manifested the rot that characterises several institutions of higher learning in India — an incompetent faculty more intent on political mischief than academic excellence, an undisciplined student body whose gang leaders usually went unpunished due to political intervention, and frequent governmental interference based on quick appeasement rather than seriously addressing complex issues with patience and gravitas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn 1979, Murari resigned from government service after experiencing a humiliating gherao in his office, surrounded by students who shamelessly blew cigarette smoke into his face and denied him drinking water. The shock of his departure speeded up urgently needed reforms: The institute was made autonomous; the old syllabus, which had been tinkered with several times, was restored, and new and well-qualified faculty was brought in.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThis book is an excellent study of the early period of a major national institution. But it is also valuable for the light it sheds on how institutions, built over years, can decay quickly due to  the venal conduct of its guardians. Looking back, we can see Murari as the pioneer who traversed pathways that he had to create himself. And, like most pioneers, he got little understanding or backing from an untutored and sceptical bureaucracy and political leadership, and inadequate support from ill-qualified colleagues, many of whom fomented intrigue and discord.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tToday, four decades later, we recognise Murari’s extraordinary achievement in shaping a world-class film school and opening vistas of artistic achievement to hundreds of filmmakers who have transformed cinema in India and obtained plaudits the world over. Murari is now justly recognised as “the maker of filmmakers”.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<hr/>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<em><strong>The reviewer is a former diplomat who is also an incorrigible film buff</strong></em></div></div>",

Equities is the longest-duration asset class. You have to have a long-term view,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that India’s transformation over the past decade has been fundamental, particularly in reducing its external vulnerabilities. At the centre of which lies its saving deficit or current account deficit, he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our oil dependency has gone down 60 per cent. Our economy has quadrupled since 2008, and our oil import bill has gone up 80 per cent during the period. It is no longer consequential to our fundamental account, which means we are not running such a large savings deficit,” Desai said, explaining how India’s rapid economic growth and reduced reliance on imported energy have lowered the impact of oil on the current account.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/markets/mutual-fund/mutual-funds-indian-markets-investors-volatility-bfsi-summit-2025-125103100497_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual fund leaders urge investors to stay the course amid volatility</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother reason for his optimism is the rise of the global capability centres (GCCs). “One of the silver linings of Covid-19 is that multinational corporations (MNCs) realised it is okay to work from home. It is okay to work from Mumbai, which is cheaper than Florida. It has triggered a big boom of GCCs. They exported $70 billion of services in the past 12 months and it is going to double in the next four to five years,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs a result, Desai said India’s current account deficit has fallen below 1 per cent, making the economy less dependent on foreign portfolio inflows.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are not so dependent on global capital market flows like we used to be. When you are not dependent on capital market flows, the beta of the market goes down. It was 1.3 in 2013. Today, India’s beta is 0.4. It’s a quintessential defensive market,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBeta is a measure of a market’s volatility or sensitivity relative to the global equity market. A beta above 1 indicates that a market is more volatile, while a beta below 1 suggests lower volatility and greater stability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDesai further explained that India’s relative underperformance this year is a function of global trends, and it will perform better during the global downcycle.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The most proximate reason why India has not done well this year is that we’ve been in a raging global equity bull market, and India is not going to do well. It’s a consumer staple stock. Consumer staple stocks don’t do well. When the next bear market arrives, India will flourish,” he said.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/markets/news/sebi-chairman-tuhin-kanta-pandey-financial-markets-investors-nse-ipo-125103100427_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Confidence of foreign investors in India remains strong, says Sebi chief</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking about threats to market growth, he said the risks largely lie outside its borders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The world is looking very messy. It is sitting on record debt and is ageing. We as a race have not figured out how to reverse the declining population,” he said, adding that while India appears to be stable, this could be a potential threat.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDomestically, Desai identified agriculture as a key sector requiring reform. We have approximately 200 million farmers, and the farm reforms that were proposed a few years ago were extremely bright and necessary, he opined. “We need to lift our farmers out of poverty. Otherwise, the remaining 1.1 billion people who don’t depend on farming will race ahead,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said India’s low farm productivity limits its potential, adding that matching China’s efficiency could make the country’s farm economy worth $2 trillion and enable it to feed half the world.</div></div>",

The state, with 243 assembly seats, will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, and the results will be announced on November 14.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmid high-stakes campaigning, major parties and alliances are gearing up for a neck-and-neck battle. Speculation is rife over whether long-serving Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will return, or if Bihar will choose a new leadership. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is yet to announce its chief ministerial candidate, casting doubt over Kumar’s comeback. On the other hand, the opposition INDIA bloc has named Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as its CM face.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs political temperatures rise, several constituencies are expected to play a decisive role in determining the outcome. Here are six key constituencies to watch in the Bihar Assembly elections 2025:</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t1. Raghopur (Vaishali district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRaghopur, in Vaishali district, is the seat of Tejashwi Yadav. It has been a stronghold of his family, with both his parents, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi, having represented it earlier. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Satish Kumar Yadav, a locally rooted leader who blends political experience with an agrarian background. If Tejashwi loses Raghopur, it would be seen as a major setback for the RJD and could signal a change in the political landscape in Bihar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t2. Mahua (Vaishali district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tMahua, which is near Vaishali, has also come to the spotlight as Tej Pratap Yadav, Tejashwi's estranged brother, is contesting after floating his own political outfit. Tej Pratap, who was disowned by his family and the RJD, will look to make strong inroads into a constituency which has a strong Yadav population, along with many Scheduled Caste and Muslim voters. He will be up against sitting RJD MLA Mukesh Kumar Raushan and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) candidate Sanjay Kumar Singh.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/elections/bihar-elections/tejashwi-accuses-nda-of-exploiting-bihar-urges-voters-to-drive-them-out-125103000486_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tejashwi accuses NDA of exploiting Bihar, urges voters to 'drive them out'</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t3. Lakhisarai (Munger region)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tLakhisarai is the home seat of BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha. It has long been a safe seat for the NDA. The area’s voters mainly include OBCs, Yadavs, and Bhumihars. If the BJP wins here again, it will prove that its support in rural Bihar remains solid. Sinha is likely to be challenged by Jan Suraaj's Suraj Kumar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t4. Patna Sahib (Urban Patna)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPatna Sahib, in the state capital, is one of the most important urban constituencies. The seat has been with the BJP for years and is seen as a test of its popularity among city voters, professionals, youth, and the middle class. Winning here would strengthen the BJP’s image in urban Bihar, while a loss could hint at changing moods in the capital. BJP's Ratnesh Kushwaha will be contesting from the Patna Sahib seat. He will be up against Congress leader Shashant Shekhar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t5. Tarapur (Munger district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOver the decades, Tarapur has seen a diverse political representation, with the Congress winning five times from this seat, while the Janata Dal (United) has secured victory six times. Meanwhile, the RJD has claimed the seat thrice. However, this time it is being seen as a BJP stronghold, with senior BJP leader Samrat Choudhary contesting from his family’s ancestral area, making it a high-stakes battle. Coudhary will be up against RJD’s Arun Kumar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t6. Phulwari (SC reserved seat, Patna district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPhulwari, a reserved seat for Scheduled Castes in Patna district, has a mix of Dalit, Muslim, and other communities. It reflects many of Bihar’s key issues, such as caste balance, reservation, and development in semi-urban areas. The result here could indicate how other reserved seats across the state might vote.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSitting MLA and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation's leader Gopal Ravidas will be challenged by former MLA and Janata Dal United (JDU) leader Shyam Rajak. Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) has fielded Shashi Kant Prasad on the seat.</div></div>",

IDBI Bank is expected to sustain growth in business while maintaining adequate capitalisation. However, sustenance of improvement in financial metrics is monitorable; CareEdge Ratings (Care Ratings) said in September 2025 rating rationale. CareEdge Ratings expects the bank to receive required support from GoI and LIC to enable smooth divestment of the shareholding.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tApart from the steady growth in advances and the consequent improvement in its core income and profit, IDBI continues to benefit from the recoveries from significantly provisioned stressed assets. The operating profitability is supported by strong recoveries from written-off accounts while credit and other provisions also remained low, supporting the overall profitability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div>",

The central bank has not made any such announcement, and the government’s fact-checking unit has confirmed that these messages are misleading.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tConfusion started when viral posts said that people can now deposit or exchange notes demonetised in 2016. However, the Press Information Bureau’s (PIB) Fact Check team has clarified that no such scheme exists, and that citizens should rely only on official RBI or government channels for verified information.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tFake post</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA viral post recently claimed that the RBI had issued a fresh notification allowing people to exchange old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes — the same denominations that were withdrawn from circulation in November 2016.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNo such rule or circular has been issued by the central bank, said the Fact Check team, urging people not to believe or forward unverified social media messages and to rely only on official sources such as:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>RBI’s website, rbi.org.in</strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Verified government handles on X and other platforms</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe PIB also advised that any suspicious messages related to the RBI or other government institutions should be reported on the cybercrime portal or directly flagged on social media platforms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhat about Rs 2,000 notes?</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Rs 2,000 note was withdrawn from circulation in May 2023, but it remains legal tender. People holding these notes can still use them for transactions or approach the nearest RBI Issue Office for exchange-related guidance.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tExchanging damaged or soiled notes</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe RBI continues to allow the exchange of soiled, mutilated, or imperfect notes at all bank branches. However:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNotes that are badly burnt, brittle, or charred and cannot withstand handling are not accepted at banks.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSuch cases can be submitted at the nearest RBI Issue Office, as listed on the central bank’s website.</div></div>",
