Hazlewood is being rested ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, and his departure opens the door for Australia’s other pacers like Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis, and Sean Abbott, who are expected to step up in his place.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe omission of left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, however, continues to raise questions. Despite his form, Arshdeep’s exclusion has left fans puzzled. Indian openers, including Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav, have had their struggles against bounce and seam movement, especially on pitches like the Bellerive Oval in Hobart. This ground, known for its batting-friendly conditions, promises another high-scoring affair, where length and placement will be key. With smaller boundaries, aggressive shot-making will be essential for both sides to dominate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India vs Australia Playing 11 </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Australia playing 11: </strong>Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav(c), Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson(w), Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Harshit Rana, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India Playing 11: </strong>Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav(c), Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson(w), Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Harshit Rana, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/pakistan-vs-south-africa-3rd-t20-playing-11-live-streaming-match-timings-125103101093_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pakistan vs South Africa 3rd T20 Playing 11, live streaming, match timings</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India vs Australia head-to-head stats</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe five-match series promises to be a battle on even keel with both countries having won eight of their last 10 T20 International games with a defeat each.

But in 2025, Laura Wolvaardt and her fearless Proteas side turned history on its head. From a disastrous opening game to scripting one of the greatest semi-final wins in World Cup history, South Africa’s journey to their maiden ICC Women’s ODI World Cup final has been nothing short of cinematic.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHere’s how the Rainbow Nation’s heroes wrote a new chapter in cricketing history - </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Nightmare Beginning: England Crush South Africa (October 3, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe tournament began on the worst possible note for South Africa. Facing England in their opener, they were bundled out for a mere 65 — their lowest-ever World Cup total. Sinalo Jafta (22) was the only batter to cross double digits as the English bowlers wreaked havoc. England chased down the target without losing a wicket, inflicting a 10-wicket defeat.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut rather than breaking them, the humiliation became a turning point, a wake-up call that ignited a fire within the Proteas camp.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Redemption Begins: Clinical Win Over New Zealand (October 6, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBattered but not beaten, South Africa regrouped and produced a superb comeback in their next game against New Zealand at Indore. The bowlers, led by Nonkululeko Mlaba (4/40), dismantled the Kiwi batting order, restricting them to 231.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChasing the target, opener Tazmin Brits (101) and Sune Luus (83) combined beautifully in a steady partnership to guide South Africa home by six wickets with 55 balls to spare. The victory wasn’t just about points, it was a statement that the Proteas were back in business.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Defining the Grit: Edging Past India in a Thriller (October 9, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe clash with hosts India in Visakhapatnam turned into an instant classic. Chasing 252, Laura Wolvaardt (70) anchored the innings with her characteristic calm, while Chloe Tryon (49) provided crucial momentum. But it was Nadine de Klerk’s ice-cool unbeaten 84* that sealed the deal, steering South Africa to a three-wicket victory with seven balls remaining.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat win against a powerhouse like India gave the Proteas belief, they could now dream big.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Another Close Finish: Bangladesh Nearly Upset the Party (October 13, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBangladesh gave South Africa a real scare in Colombo. Chasing 233, South Africa stumbled early before Marizanne Kapp (56) and Tryon (62) steadied the innings. Still, it took late fireworks from Nadine de Klerk (37* off 29) and Masabata Klaas (10* off 13) to clinch a narrow three-wicket win.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt was the kind of victory that defines champions, scrappy, hard-earned, and full of character.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/shreyas-iyer-health-update-batter-discharged-from-hospital-confirms-bcci-125110100363_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Shreyas Iyer health update: Batter discharged from hospital, confirms BCCI</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Back to Dominance: Ten-Wicket Win Against Sri Lanka (October 17, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter a string of tense finishes, the Proteas found their rhythm again in a rain-shortened encounter against Sri Lanka. Set a 20-over target of 121, Laura Wolvaardt (60*) and Tazmin Brits (55*) made light work of the chase, cruising to a 10-wicket win.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt was South Africa’s most convincing display yet, calm, clinical, and commanding.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rain and Ruthlessness: Demolishing Pakistan (October 21, 2025)</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAgainst Pakistan, South Africa produced their most dominant batting performance of the group stage.

Leg-spinner Alana King tore through the Proteas lineup with a stunning 7/18, dismissing them for just 98. Australia chased the target easily, winning by seven wickets.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe defeat dropped South Africa to third in the standings, setting up a daunting semi-final clash with tournament heavyweights England.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Semifinal Masterclass: Wolvaardt’s 169 and Kapp’s Magic (October 29, 2025)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCometh the hour, cometh the captain. Laura Wolvaardt delivered a once-in-a-lifetime innings in the semi-final at Guwahati, smashing a breathtaking 169 off 143 balls, the highest individual score of the tournament. Her knock propelled South Africa to a commanding 319, leaving England chasing shadows.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThen came the finishing act, Marizanne Kapp, the heartbeat of South African cricket, produced a masterclass with the ball, taking 5 wickets and becoming the all-time leading wicket-taker in Women’s World Cup history. England crumbled for 194, and the Proteas romped into their first-ever World Cup final with a 125-run win.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Date With Destiny</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom a 10-wicket humiliation to the grandest stage in world cricket, South Africa’s rise has been extraordinary.
