The growth was driven by broad-based growth across all segments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe core India services business remained profitable at an adjusted Ebitda level, while international markets (UAE and Singapore) achieved Adjusted Ebitda breakeven.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUrban Company continued to invest in two long-term growth initiatives — Insta Help and Native. The company reported an adjusted Ebitda loss of Rs 35 crore for the quarter, primarily due to a loss of Rs 44 crore  in Insta Help, its new vertical focused on daily cleaning and housekeeping services. Excluding Insta Help, the business delivered an adjusted Ebitda  profit of Rs 10 crore  (+0.9 per cent of NTV), marking an improvement of Rs 15 crore year-on-year (Y-o-Y). </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company reported strong growth across all segments during the quarter. Consolidated Net Transaction Value (NTV) grew 34 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹1,030 crore (excluding KSA), reflecting broad-based performance across verticals.

Revenue from operations increased 24 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹262 crore. Adjusted Ebitda for this segment was ₹18 crore, or 2.4 per cent of NTV, compared with 3.1 per cent in the same period last year. The Y-o-Y decline in margin was attributed to increased investments in training and audits, user acquisition, faster fulfilment, customer support, and team expansion, aimed at positioning the business for long-term sustainable growth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Native business recorded strong momentum, with NTV rising 164 per cent  Y-o-Y to ₹97 crore, led by significant growth in water purifiers and electronic door locks portfolios. Revenue from operations increased 179 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹75 crore. Adjusted Ebitda stood at a loss of ₹9 crore, or negative 9.0 per cent of NTV, marking a substantial improvement from a loss of 30.1 per cent of NTV in the same period last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>International segment</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the International segment, NTV grew 73% year-on-year to ₹160 crore (excluding KSA), supported by strong performance in the UAE and Singapore markets. Revenue from operations rose 66 per cent year-on-year to ₹41 crore (excluding KSA). The business achieved adjusted Ebitda breakeven across combined operations in these markets.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInsta Help, launched earlier this year, is a high-frequency vertical offering daily housekeeping services. It is expected to become a large-scale, high-frequency business that strengthens Urban Company’s core platform. It is making upfront investments to build and grow the business. Within just eight months of the launch, Insta Help scaled rapidly to 468,000 orders in October, despite limited geographic coverage. Customer retention and repeat usage have been strong, though steady-state behaviour is expected to evolve over time. Insta Help reported an adjusted Ebitda loss of ₹44 crore in Q2FY26, reflecting early-phase investments in supply onboarding, training, and network densification.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹2,136 crore, providing a strong foundation for continued investment and growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to practice genuine multilateralism, according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xi, Lee discuss North Korea</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tChinese state media reports on the Xi-Lee meeting didn't immediately carry any North Korea-related comments by Xi.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Wi Sung-lac, Lee's national security director, said Lee during the meeting outlined his strategy for achieving denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and requested a constructive Chinese role to help realise the resumption of talks with North Korea.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tXi replied that he would continue his efforts to help resolve issues involving the Korean Peninsula and promote peace and stability here, Wi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina is North Korea's traditional ally and economic pipeline, but there are still questions about how much leverage it has on its impoverished neighbour. China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing UN sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against US influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe North Korea item in the Lee-Xi meeting drew an irritated response from Pyongyang. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about its daydream of realising North Korea's denuclearisation.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee, an advocate of reconciliation with North Korea, said earlier Saturday he would take more active preemptive steps to lower military tensions with the North, stressing that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said South Korea and China also signed several agreements on jointly combating online scams, expanding a bilateral free trade deal and renewing a currency swap deal that expired last month.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders call for greater cooperation</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAfter two days of talks, APEC leaders vowed greater cooperation to tackle shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by rising protectionism and trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTheir joint statement declared that the APEC leaders \"acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenges.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, it says.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJeonghun Min, a professor at South Korea's National Diplomatic Academy, said the statement avoided direct language supporting free and open trade, which would not have received backing from the United States, but still endorsed economic cooperation and multilateralism at the core of APEC's mission.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It wasn't possible to leave that out entirely, said Min.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe joint declaration also said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a new 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that's free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\n<strong>APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tWhile the summit's opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday's meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAPEC leaders also issued two separate statements on Saturday. One called for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges in rapidly evolving digital environments. The other urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, ageing populations and accelerated urbanisation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that investing in China is investing in the future.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEstablished in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration. But the region now faces challenges such as the US-China rivalry, supply chain disruptions, ageing populations and the impact of AI on jobs.</p><p></p></div>",

Still in absolute terms, net collections remained strong at Rs 1.69 trillion, making October the third best month of FY26 after April and May.

October GST collections reflect transactions undertaken in September, and therefore capture only a partial impact of the GST rate rationalisation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The GST collections, while aligning with immediate expectations, reflect a muted momentum due to the rate rationalisation effect in the majority part of September month and deferred consumer spending ahead of the festival season.

Beijing claims almost the entire region, while ASEAN members, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also claim ownership of coastal areas and features. The Philippines, a key US ally, has had frequent clashes with China's maritime fleet.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tManila has repeatedly urged a stronger regional response, but ASEAN has traditionally sought to balance caution with economic ties to Beijing, the region's largest trading partner.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHegseth criticised Beijing's recent declaration of Scarborough Shoal, which China forcefully seized from the Philippines in 2012, as a nature reserve.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tYou don't put platforms on nature reserves, he said, describing China's activities on the uninhabited shoal. He told the meeting it was yet another attempt to coerce new and expanded territorial and maritime claims at your expense.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHegseth said China's provocative actions challenged and threatened territorial sovereignty in the region. While stressing that Washington values continued dialogue with Beijing, Hegseth said the US will monitor China's behaviour closely.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina's sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea fly in the face of their commitments to resolve disputes peacefully, he said. \"We seek peace. We do not seek conflict. But we must ensure that China is not seeking to dominate you or anybody else.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHegseth urged ASEAN to hasten the conclusion of a Code of Conduct that the bloc is negotiating with China to govern behaviour at sea. But he said the bloc should also strengthen its capability, including enhanced joint surveillance and rapid-response tools to deter provocations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe proposed the development of a shared maritime domain awareness that will alert all members if one nation is threatened. That goes a long way in ensuring that whoever is on the receiving end of aggression and provocation is ... not alone, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe also welcomed plans for an ASEAN-US maritime exercise in December that he said would increase interoperability and reinforce freedom of navigation and the sovereign rights of all nations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChina rejects US criticism of its maritime conduct, accusing Washington of interfering in regional affairs and provoking tensions through its military presence. Chinese officials say their patrols and construction activities are lawful and aimed at maintaining security in what they consider Chinese territory.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChinese officials on Saturday slammed the Philippines for being a troublemaker after Manila staged naval and air drills with the US, Australia and New Zealand in the South China Sea. The two-day exercise that ended Friday was the 12th that the Philippines says it has carried out with partner nations since last year to protect its rights in the disputed waters.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe drills included an anti-submarine warfare simulation, replenishment and fueling at sea, air operations and communication exercises.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTian Junli, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theatre Command, said the exercise seriously undermined regional peace and stability. It further proves that the Philippines is the troublemaker in the South China Sea issue and a saboteur of regional stability, he said.</p><p></p></div>",
