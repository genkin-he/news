Given that India took leadership in the G20 to push for global regulation — and we now have a kind of blueprint — it’s ironic that 18 G20 nations have some form of regulation, and India doesn’t. It’s time we all came together to create one. It’s not that difficult.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSumit Gupta, cofounder and chief executive officer of CoinDCX, added: “It’s high time we looked at regulations. The best time to regulate was yesterday; the next best is today. If we don’t act now, we’ll lose out. It’s a big risk if we fail to innovate in this sector.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tG Padmanabhan, former executive director of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said the financial sector is inevitably moving towards digitisation and tokenisation, making regulation essential. “The future of finance is digital. The future of finance is tokenisation,” he said. Padmanabhan also noted that while India may have missed its early opportunity in crypto, it cannot afford to ignore stablecoins. “Among International Monetary Fund member countries, nearly 70 per cent are already working on some form of regulation for stablecoins. They believe stablecoin growth will outpace that of crypto,” he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\tS B Seker, head of Asia-Pacific at Binance, said the absence of clear regulation has kept digital assets from becoming a national focus. “India has been a standout leader in digital asset adoption over the past four years. But the country needs to decide its model — there are plenty of global examples to follow,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked whether the sector needs a separate regulatory body, panellists were divided. Seker said outcomes mattered more than structure: “There are two models — Dubai created a separate regulator, while others integrated it into existing systems. As long as there’s a constitutional mandate, a new body isn’t necessary.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPadmanabhan agreed: “Having a separate regulator won’t solve everything. What matters is having the right people with the right attitude to let innovation thrive until issues arise.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the “crypto bus” may have left the station, the panellists agreed that India cannot delay its stance on stablecoins.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChenoy said one of the RBI’s biggest concerns — dollarisation — could be mitigated by a rupee-backed stablecoin. “If you want to address that, look at what the Brics nations did — they created a trade settlement mechanism based on virtual digital assets not linked to the dollar. India didn’t participate. Since we’re the world’s largest remittance market, a rupee-backed stablecoin could cut remittance costs,” he said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPadmanabhan added that from a monetary policy standpoint, India must study stablecoins closely.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“As we speak, around 97 per cent of stablecoins are linked to the US dollar. If that continues, two things could happen: the dollar becomes even more dominant, and our monetary policy weakens,” he warned.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that global stablecoin circulation could reach $2 trillion by 2030, Gupta said:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If we don’t act now, others will internationalise their currencies while India lags. We need to internationalise the rupee.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeker added: “As digital dollars become programmable and interoperable, their global influence will grow. India must make the rupee digitally available to stay competitive.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen it comes to crypto, India faces a peculiar problem: while crypto itself lacks regulatory support, associated technologies like blockchain and Web3 are also getting sidelined.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGupta said unclear rules are driving crypto entrepreneurs abroad. “Running an exchange in India has been a nightmare because of the uncertainty. Ninety per cent of my friends — talented Indian Institute of Technology graduates — have moved overseas. If we’re too late, it’ll be hard to bring that talent back.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChenoy agreed that regulatory delays are costing India both innovation and jobs. “By delaying regulation, we’re putting Indian companies at a disadvantage and pushing them to move overseas,” he said. “A recent study showed that 27 per cent of India’s largest crypto product creators have already relocated abroad.”</div></div>",

There are more and more instances globally in the last two or three months, where non-customer-centric businesses have been hacked.”<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about customer awareness, Mahavir Jindal, chief operating officer (COO), Amazon Pay India, said it is not easy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that educating customers is going to be a long journey. “It is a journey that we need to start now. We are still at the base layer, where we are still talking about phishing and how to safeguard against this.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMalcolm Gomes, COO at IDfy, also said that there is still a highly vulnerable population which includes the elderly and some who don’t understand mainstream languages.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The basics have been done, but there is a lot more that needs to be done through video and Whatsapp channels. Everyone is doing their fair share. The RBI does, banks do. I still feel it has not got to perhaps the most vulnerable sections of society. That is also where a lot of the source problems are,” Gomes said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAll the three experts also agreed on the urgent need for a zero-trust approach — a model now seen as essential for securing digital ecosystems as regulators demand greater operational transparency.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA zero-trust model treats every user and device as untrusted, requiring continuous verification before granting access to systems or data.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGomes said that zero trust has existed for a while, “It started with the NIST in the US, and the thought process came from there. At this point, regulators have not mandated it, but it has crept into the thought process of organisations.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said it doesn’t help that AI tools are getting much more sophisticated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJindal, too, said, “If someone is in a financial services business, he has to operate in a zero-trust environment,” adding that for him, zero trust is “all-pervasive.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about the threat vectors, which are evolving rapidly, he said zero-trust capabilities must advance in tandem.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said that at Amazon Pay, “any data exchange, whether with an external partner or an internal one, happens in a zero-trust environment — implying an exchange of keys.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he believes the industry is doing a decent job implementing zero-trust systems, Jindal warned that the pace of cyber threats continues to accelerate.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“While we have a good foundation, there is a long way to go to address the emerging threat vectors,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile talking about cyber security becoming a priority for organisations, Mukherjee said, “For any organisation, there are multiple competing priorities. Needless to say that cyber for most organisations is among the top.”</div></div>",

Then the cost can also come down, as we won’t need a screen. Evolving from digital reach to digital trust is important. The next 300-400 million people would transact digitally when they feel secure. We are working on how we can build trust,” he said. </div></div>",
