Many sustained injuries or suffered breathlessness and were admitted to local hospitals. According to the survivors, chaos broke out when the only fate was abruptly opened, allowing those who had compeleted their darshan to come out, while another group waiting below tried to enter. This resulted in people falling on one another and a weak steel grill gave way, trapping many devotees underneath. The approach to the temple is narrow. There were many people and only single entry and exit point. As people jostled, we fell down. The steel grill was also very weak. The grill people were holding onto broke and everybody fell, an autorickhaw driver, who survived the accident, told media.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said around 20 devotees from his Dharmapuram village had travelled in two autorickshaws to the temple.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"A boy who was also standing under the grill died.

Opening the gate at once led to those coming out pushing against us, she said adding she fell down and three people fell on her. A second male survivor said so many devotees were pushing against the closed gate. Then the door opened suddenly from the other side. Those returning came down with force. Because of their pressure, the people standing by the door and on the staircase could not stand. They all fell over one another, he said. He said the tragedy could have been averted if separate routes had been arranged for entry and exit. \"There were provisions, but they did not use it.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tA woman who broke her legs in the incident, said she visited the temple for auspicious 'Ekadasi' day.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAs people fell on me, my leg got stuck in a rod and broke...

Another woman from Tekkali mandal, attending to her injured husband at the hospital, said devotees are also to blame for the tragedy. We saw the crowd and went ahead. But the temple authorities should have stopped us, she said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCriticising the poor arrangements at the temple, she said even basic facilities like drinking water were not available. This is very unfortunate. We go to see God to seek blessings. Had the police been deployed this might have been prevented, she added.
