The data does not distinguish between the different causes of delays, such as staffing shortages or bad weather.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tStaffing-related delays at Orlando's airport on Thursday, for example, averaged nearly four and a half hours for some time, according to the FAA.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMost controllers are continuing to work mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said. That leaves little time for a side job to help cover bills, mortgage and other expenses unless controllers call out.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDuffy said controllers are also struggling to get to work because they can't afford to fill up their cars with gas. Controllers missed their first full paycheck on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor this nation's air traffic controllers, missing just one paycheck can be a significant hardship, as it is for all working Americans. Asking them to go without a full month's pay or more is simply not sustainable,\" Nick Daniels, president of NATCA, said Friday in a statement.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLast weekend, a shortage of controllers led to the FAA issuing a brief ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Flights were held at their originating airports for about two hours Sunday until the FAA lifted the ground stop.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome US airports have stepped in to provide food donations and other support for federal aviation employees working without pay, including controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore the shutdown, the FAA was already dealing with a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.</p><p></p></div>",

A total of 328 passengers and 15 crew members were onboard the two aircraft, but no injuries were reported.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOne of the planes had just arrived from Orlando, Florida, and was turning toward its gate when it accidentally clipped the tail of another United aircraft waiting to take off for Houston. The Houston-bound plane was stationary at the time of the incident. Shortly after, both planes returned to the gate, and all passengers disembarked safely.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tAirports struggling across US</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tThe incident occurred as airports across the United States were already dealing with major delays caused by severe weather and staffing shortages due to the ongoing government shutdown.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt LaGuardia, average ground delays exceeded two hours, with some flights waiting up to five.

According to the report, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that if the shutdown extends into November and the holiday season, unpaid controllers may be forced to take second jobs, potentially causing widespread disruptions.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tA month into US government shutdown</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tAs of Saturday, the US government has been shut down for 31 days.

The three astronauts on Shenzhou 21 will enter the Tianhe core module of the space station.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe crew includes pilot and mission commander Zhang Lu, who also was on the Shenzhou 15 mission to the space station two years ago.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe other two are flying for the first time.

Zhang Hongzhang is a payload specialist who was a researcher focusing on new energy and new materials before becoming an astronaut.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tZhang said the team would turn the space station into a utopia by doing tai-chi, gardening and appreciating poetry on the Tiangong space station. Like those before them, they will stay at the station for roughly six months.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile in space, the astronauts planned to conduct 27 scientific and applied projects in biotechnology, aerospace medicine, materials science and other areas.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFor the first time, China is sending mice to its space station. Four in total, two males and two females, will be monitored to study how weightlessness and confinement affect their behavioral patterns, said Han Pei, an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This will help us master key technologies for the breeding and monitoring of small mammals in space and make a preliminary assessment of the mice's emergency responses and adaptive changes in space environments, Han said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe space mice were selected from 300 candidates after more than 60 days of intensive training, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency. State media China National Radio reported that the mice are expected to stay five to seven days in the space station and hitch a ride in Shenzhou 20 coming back to Earth.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tChina's space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of the nation's technological advances over the past two decades. China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tZhang Jingbo, a spokesperson for the China Manned Space Agency, said the research and development work is progressing smoothly for the agency's plans to send an astronaut to the moon.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOur fixed goal of China landing a person on the moon by 2030 is firm, Zhang said at a news conference a day ahead of the launch.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace, space station has helped make China a major player in space.

The space agency's plan is to send one of them on a short-term mission as a payload expert, in what would be the first visit to the space station by a foreign astronaut.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",
