Those activities count as digital trade when the transactions cross national borders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile Trump wields tariffs to rebalance US deficits in merchandise trade, his push for a global internet free of import duties and other surcharges is aimed at ensuring the world’s largest economy remains the leading net exporter of e-services. That stands in contrast with the prior administration under Joe Biden, which was more sympathetic to European officials’ concerns about unfettered access to markets for US tech giants including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The Trump administration believes that our deficit in trade in goods has been unfairly imposed, but that our surplus in trade in services has been fairly earned” and wants to “maintain our services surplus, while reducing our goods deficit,” said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown Law in Washington. “I could understand why other countries would feel that this is itself unfair.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLast year, global exports of digitally delivered services increased to more than $4.77 trillion, a nearly 10 per cent jump from 2023 and more than double the growth in total goods and services trade, according to World Trade Organization and United Nations figures. It’s the fastest-growing segment of global goods and services trade that reached about $33 trillion last year.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSupercharging digital trade is artificial intelligence, raising questions for officials concerned about national security, data sovereignty, intellectual property abuse and consumer privacy protections as online services flow unchecked across borders. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFor some nations, it means a loss of government revenue as items formerly shipped as goods – a book or a movie, for example – are now sent digitally and out of reach of traditional customs duties.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAs Trump tries to rewire the global trading system, digital commerce has become another battleground for geopolitical fragmentation where Washington and Beijing are jockeying for influence across Africa, Latin America and South Asia.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe new US provisions for Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand stand out because they call for long-term acceptance of an agreement forged at the WTO calling on all countries to refrain from putting tariffs on digital services.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAll three Southeast Asian economies agreed to support a permanent extension of the WTO accord known as the “moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAside from that initiative and another aimed at protecting fisheries, Washington has abandoned the WTO – the referee of the rules-based trading system for the past 30 years - in favor of Trump’s unilateral approach with so-called reciprocal tariffs.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\r\n\t\tGlobal Agreement</h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe WTO moratorium has been extended by consensus every two years since 1998, most recently in 2024 when it only was approved in a last-minute deal held up by objections from India. It comes up for renewal again heading into the Geneva-based organization’s ministerial meeting in March 2026 in Cameroon.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The commitments in the US deals to facilitate the free flow of data are absolutely welcome – especially when set against the trend for localization requirements that we’ve seen in recent years,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “While country-by-country progress is valuable, the ultimate goal should be to anchor these norms in a new international deal.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMalaysia’s accord with Trump included the additional concession that it will refrain from “requiring US social media platforms and cloud service providers to pay into Malaysia’s domestic fund.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe latest digital pacts by the US – plus a preliminary one with Vietnam that contains a vague pledge to finalize digital services commitments — follow a framework the US announced in July with Indonesia, whose customs agency had preemptively added a line for digital services in its harmonized tariff schedule, or HTS. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThat deal specified that “Indonesia has committed to eliminate existing HTS tariff lines on ‘intangible products’ and suspend related requirements on import declarations,” according to the White House document.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tUnder Trump, the US push for a permanent extension will have to address concerns from Brazil and India, both of which have faced some of the steepest US tariffs. In the past, both have wanted to preserve the option of raising revenue from foreign tech companies and protecting domestic e-commerce companies. Keeping the moratorium renewable also gave them leverage in other areas of trade.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“That extension looked very shaky after the last ministerial conference,” said Simon Evenett, a professor of geopolitics and strategy at IMD Business School in St. Gallen, Switzerland.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\t\tUS Big Tech</h3>\n<div>\r\n\t\tStill, he said, while the US uses its leverage to push for a permanent extension of the moratorium, “it’s too soon to say this represents broad-based WTO re-engagement — more likely, it’s selective engagement on a topic critical to US big tech.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDigital services provisions are part of most modern trade agreements, though the US and European Union have different views on the need for openness.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tOfficials in Brussels want safeguards against anti-competitive behavior and stricter data privacy protections — oversight that US officials consider over-regulation. Some European countries have annoyed Washington by imposing taxes on digital services, viewing such moves as domestic fiscal policy that’s outside the scope of trade talks. French lawmakers earlier this week voted to double a tax on large technology companies, risking a backlash from Trump.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe US-EU trade framework dated Aug. 21 noted both sides “commit to address unjustified digital trade barriers” and will together pursue a permanent WTO’s e-commerce moratorium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tMartina Ferracane, an associate professor of international digital trade at Teesside University in the UK, said another temporary extension is likelier than a permanent one because the US administration has “weakened its credibility” to lead a global consensus on the issue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tShe cited Trump’s pledge to put 100 per cent tariffs on films made outside the US as an example of a “threat of non-compliance” with the international ban on tariffs on digital commerce.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAnalysts remain cautiously optimistic on ITC’s outlook despite a muted September quarter of financial year 2026 (Q2FY26) performance, on the back of stable cigarette volumes, broad-based FMCG growth, and easing input costs that could lift margins in the second half of the year. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the Agri business continued to weigh on topline performance, analysts believe the worst of the headwinds are behind, setting the stage for gradual recovery across verticals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tMuted quarter, but core performance steady</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tITC’s Q2 performance was subdued, with standalone revenue declining 3.4 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹18,020 crore, dragged down by a sharp 31 per cent drop in Agri business revenues. Excluding Agri, growth stood at a healthy 7 per cent Y-o-Y, driven by resilient performance in cigarettes and the non-cigarette FMCG segment. Ebitda rose 2.1 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹6,550 crore, while margins expanded 186 basis points (bps) Y-o-Y to 34.7 per cent, aided by cost discipline and an improved mix.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCigarette revenues grew 6.8 per cent Y-o-Y, implying a 6 per cent volume growth across most estimates. Analysts noted that while competitive intensity remains high, premium offerings and stable taxation helped sustain momentum. The non-cigarette FMCG business expanded around 7–8 per cent Y-o-Y, with strong showings in staples, dairy, and personal care products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tCigarette momentum steady; margin pressure likely to ease</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMost brokerages pointed to steady cigarette volumes but acknowledged continued pressure on profitability due to elevated leaf tobacco costs. According to Emkay Global, cigarette Ebit margins contracted 170bps Y-o-Y to 70.7 per cent, reflecting the gradual absorption of high-cost leaf tobacco inventories accumulated during FY23-24. However, with procurement prices moderating in the current crop cycle, analysts expect cost benefits to reflect meaningfully from FY27 onwards.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Containment of market share loss will be key for valuations,” Emkay noted, maintaining an ‘Add’ rating with a target price of ₹475. The brokerage expects cigarette earnings growth of around 6 per cent in FY26, accelerating to low double digits in FY27 as input costs normalize.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tICICI Securities echoed similar sentiment, highlighting stable category trends across the cigarette industry. “Ebit margins were impacted by higher leaf costs and rising competition, but sequential stability offers comfort,” it said. The brokerage sees easing input costs and a healthy product mix supporting margin recovery in H2FY26. It maintained an ‘Add’ rating with a DCF-based target price of ₹450.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama Institutional Equities also underscored the steady 6 per cent cigarette volume growth and rising contribution from premium offerings. “Improved mix and operating leverage helped lift Ebitda margin by 186bps Y-o-Y to 34.7 per cent,” it said, adding that ITC’s dominance with over 75 per cent market share positions it well to defend its leadership despite intensifying competition. The brokerage cut FY27-28 earnings estimates marginally and revised its target price to ₹534 (from ₹540 earlier), maintaining a ‘Buy’ rating.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tFMCG resilience continues; Agri and Paper weigh on growth</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBrokerages were unanimous that the non-cigarette FMCG business remains a bright spot in ITC’s portfolio. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal said FMCG sales grew 8.5 per cent Y-o-Y, led by strong demand for staples, snacks, and personal care products, though notebook sales continued to weigh on growth. “Consistent focus on new launches, stable taxes, and a recovery in consumption are expected to drive momentum from H2FY26,” it said.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAcross brokerages, analysts noted that digital-first and organic brands such as Yogabar, Mother Sparsh, Prasuma, Meatigo, and 24 Mantra clocked annualised revenue run-rates (ARR) of over ₹1,100 crore, underscoring ITC’s growing presence in premium and health-conscious categories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Agri business, however, remained the biggest drag, down 31 per cent Y-o-Y due to a high base and shipment delays amid US tariff uncertainty. While segment Ebit was flat Y-o-Y, margins expanded sharply due to a favourable mix. The Paperboards and Packaging division grew 5 per cent Y-o-Y in revenue but faced a 21 per cent Ebit decline due to low-priced imports and elevated wood costs, though sequential performance improved as domestic demand recovered.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts see recovery from H2FY26</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite short-term weakness, most brokerages see earnings momentum strengthening into the second half of FY26 as commodity inflation eases and demand recovers. Stable cigarette taxation and improving cost dynamics are expected to cushion margins, while FMCG and Paper segments should benefit from normalised input prices and policy support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Portfolio balance, stable taxation, and disciplined execution reinforce earnings resilience,” ICICI Securities said. Those at Motilal Oswal added that cigarette Ebit margins are likely to improve from Q4FY26, with paper margins bottoming out. The brokerage has maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of 515.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, the <em>Street’s</em> tone remains constructive. Analysts agree that while ITC’s Q2 was muted, the company’s diversified portfolio, strong cash flows, and easing cost headwinds set the stage for a steady recovery ahead.</div></div>",

Net revenue for the quarter increased 11.6 per cent to ₹3,173 crore.

Looking ahead, the second half of the year is the all-important festive, holiday and wedding season.\"</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added: \"We are excited about our commercial and marketing programs bringing our brand portfolio alive for consumers while driving category salience and growth.\"</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tICICI Securities on United Spirits</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts at ICICI Securities noted that United Spirits surprised consensus with better-than-expected price elasticity, aided by a strong performance in the Popular segment. Margins were driven by pricing, input stability, and lower advertising spends, which the analysts described as “somewhat sustainable.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report said: \"USL’s performance was ahead of our estimates, with revenue/volume growth of 11.5 per cent/7.7 per cent Y-o-Y, aided by the reopening of Andhra Pradesh and steady performance in the P&amp;A segment, partially offset by a decline in Maharashtra. Reported P&amp;A brands’ volume/revenue grew 8.0 per cent/12.4 per cent Y-o-Y, with realisation growth of 4.0 per cent Y-o-Y. Popular segment’s volume/value grew 6.1 per cent/9.0 per cent Y-o-Y, largely driven by the reopening of the AP market.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe analysts expect that in the near term, duty increases in Maharashtra could weigh on performance. Over the long term, however, they see healthy growth supported by structural premiumisation, successful relaunches of legacy brands, and prudent cost management.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tICICI Securities has marginally tweaked its estimates for FY26E/FY27E and introduced FY28 projections. The firm models revenue/Ebitda/PAT CAGR of 10 per cent/13 per cent/11 per cent over FY25–28E, driven by a focus on premiumisation. \"We maintain Add with a revised DCF-based target price of ₹1,550 (previously ₹1,450), as we roll forward to Sep’27 estimates,\" the report said. Key risks include changes in taxation, raw material price volatility, and failure to revive legacy brands.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tNuvama on United Spirits</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tNuvama Institutional Equities also maintained its Buy rating on United Spirits following the Q2FY26 results. Analysts noted that the company reported a solid set of numbers, with overall revenue up 12 per cent Y-o-Y and Ebitda up 33 per cent Y-o-Y—ahead of both their and consensus estimates.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report highlighted that strong performance was driven by Andhra Pradesh, coupled with innovation and renovation offerings and a favourable base. Overall volumes grew 7.7 per cent Y-o-Y. P&amp;A sales/volumes increased 12.4 per cent/8 per cent Y-o-Y, while Popular sales/volumes rose 9.2 per cent/6.1 per cent Y-o-Y. Gross and Ebitda margins, both at multi-quarter highs, expanded 190 bps/337 bps Y-o-Y to 47.1 per cent/21.2 per cent.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tMonths after the deadly crash in Ahmedabad that left over 240 people dead, Air India is now seeking ₹10,000 crore ($1.1 billion) in financial support from its owners, Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, as it grapples with the aftermath, along with other challenges, <em>Bloomberg </em>reported.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCiting sources, the report added that the request from Air India includes funding to upgrade the carrier's systems and services and to build in-house engineering and maintenance departments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAfter facing multiple setbacks, the ailing carrier is far from achieving its goal of breaking even by the end of March next year. Its request for additional funding sheds light on the difficulties of surviving in India's aviation market, where several carriers have exited after incurring losses. InterGlobe Aviation, which operates IndiGo, is currently the only profitable domestic airline, with over 64 per cent market share.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAir India is jointly owned by Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines. While the Tata Group has a 74.9 per cent stake in the carrier, the remaining is held by Singapore Airlines. The report suggests that any financial aid to the carrier would be proportional to ownership. However, the owners will decide if the funding will take the form of an interest-free loan or equity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tAir India's decline</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe carrier's path to profitability had already begun to falter after it was forced to operate longer non-stop west-bound flights from India due to airspace restrictions imposed after India and Pakistan engaged in military confrontations in May. The Indian armed forces launched a pre-emptive, coordinated strike on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Codenamed 'Operation Sindoor', the strikes were in response to the deadly April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe financial position of the carrier worsened further after a Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet bound for London, on June 12, crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad, killing all but one on board.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the wake of the tragedy, India's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), ordered a comprehensive system-wide safety audit. The carrier also reduced its international services operated by widebody jets by 15 per cent between June and August, further denting its revenue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tAir India to incur loss of ₹4,000 cr: CEO</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier this week, Air India's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Campbell Wilson, said that while there are many uncertainties that are affecting the overall travel demand, they cannot derail the carrier.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>Nomura on Swiggy: </strong>Japan-based brokerage firm Nomura has raised its target price on Swiggy to ₹560 from ₹550 earlier while retaining its ‘Buy’ rating, pointing to strong momentum in the company’s food delivery operations, a planned fund-raise to strengthen its quick commerce business, and improving visibility on profitability. The new target implies a potential 34 per cent upside from current levels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating and raise SOTP-based TP marginally to ₹560 (from ₹550 earlier). In our view, disciplined execution and improving visibility on breakeven will be key catalysts for the stock to do well from here,” said Abhishek Bhandari and Karan Nain of Nomura, in a note dated October 31, 2025.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\n<strong><em>Meanwhile, here are the top three reasons behind the target price hike:</em></strong></h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tStrong growth in food delivery business</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwiggy’s food delivery (FD) arm continued its solid performance in the September quarter (Q2FY26), driven by sustained order growth and operational efficiency. The company’s gross order value (GOV) rose 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) and 19 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y), in line with Nomura’s expectations and ahead of Zomato’s 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth in the same period. Monthly transacting users (MTU) climbed 5.7 per cent sequentially to 17.2 million, reflecting improving engagement on the platform.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe take rate, including delivery charges, inched up 10 basis points (bps) Q-o-Q to 25.8 per cent, while contribution margin (CM) remained steady at 7.3 per cent, despite competitive pressures such as lower subscription fees and reduced minimum order values. Adjusted Ebitda margin, as a percentage of GOV, improved 44 basis points Q-o-Q to 2.8 per cent. Nomura highlighted that Swiggy’s difference between GOV and net order value (NOV) growth was only around 0.5 per cent, compared to Zomato’s ~4 per cent gap, suggesting better pricing and volume alignment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura expects Swiggy’s FD segment to maintain its momentum, projecting 19-20 per cent Y-o-Y growth in GOV over FY26–27, with contribution margins expanding modestly to 7.5-7.7 per cent. This sustained growth trajectory, coupled with operational discipline, underpins analysts’ confidence in Swiggy’s long-term value creation potential.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tFund-raising to strengthen quick commerce business</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSwiggy’s management has announced plans to raise around ₹10,000 crore to bolster its quick commerce (QC) arm, a segment that continues to face heightened competition. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura noted that the company’s fund-raising efforts are timely, given the dynamic nature of the QC space and peers’ aggressive capital deployment. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRival Zepto recently secured $450 million in new funding, while Zomato’s Blinkit holds about ₹20,000 crore in cash reserves. Strengthening the balance sheet through this capital infusion will boost Swiggy’s ability to invest in growth, logistics, and technology while sustaining its competitive positioning.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tBetter visibility on profitability</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNomura believes disciplined execution, operational efficiency, and a clearer path toward breakeven are key catalysts for Swiggy’s stock performance in the coming quarters. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage stressed that improving contribution margins and a gradual ramp-up in QC economics provide better visibility on profitability. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Nomura also flagged risks such as intensified competition in the QC business and a potential macroeconomic slowdown that could temper order growth in the online food delivery segment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "id": 125103100112,
            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Alisha Sachdev</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord Motor Co plans to invest about ₹3,250 crore ($370 million) in India to make new engines, a person familiar with the matter said, signaling renewed confidence in the country and defying Donald Trump’s promotion of American manufacturing as it reopens a factory closed four years ago.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Maraimalai Nagar manufacturing site in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu will be retooled to make high-end engines for export markets with an annual capacity of over 200,000 units, said the person, asking not to be named as the plans are private. The engines will not be exported to the US, but it’s unclear which countries they will be sent to, the person said, adding an announcement is expected as early as this week.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US automaker, which first signaled its interest in resuming local production in India a year ago, has been preparing the investment for months against a backdrop of heightened tensions between New Delhi and Washington. Trump placed a 50 per cent tariff on Indian imports earlier this year in a trade standoff, and has lashed out at the Asian country’s purchase of Russian oil. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe move comes even as Trump made boosting manufacturing in the US — especially where the automotive industry is concerned — a signature policy goal. Ford caught flack from the president during his first term for a plan to increase output outside the US, but more recently won praise from him after announcing major investments at its domestic plants. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord declined to comment. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFord’s decision reflects renewed confidence in India as a manufacturing base from Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley and comes as it pivots from a previous focus on electric vehicles. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company first set up manufacturing near Chennai in 1995 and added a second plant in Sanand, Gujarat, in 2015. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShortly after becoming CEO in 2020, Farley pulled the plug on a deal with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. that would have kept Ford vehicles on Indian roads. He abandoned the market altogether less than a year later, saying it could no longer pour capital into marginal markets like India and Brazil that provided little or no return. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBy by the time it exited, Ford racked up losses totaling over $2 billion. It ultimately sold off the Sanand vehicle plant to Tata Motors, which now builds EVs there. In 2020, Ford’s chief US rival, General Motors Co, also ceased production in India, three years after shifting to an export-only business model. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMore recently, other US companies have been building up their manufacturing presence in India, despite the political tension. Trump singled out Apple Inc. in May for its decision to manufacture in India, but the tech giant has since ramped up iPhone production across five Indian factories.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTamil Nadu, where Ford plans to restart its old facility, is one of India’s largest industrialized states and a longtime automaking hub. It’s home to manufacturing facilities operated by Hyundai Motor Co., Renault SA, and BMW AG.</div></div>",
