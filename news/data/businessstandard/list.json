However, valuations are not cheap. Government debt is at an all-time high,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGunwani added the real growth opportunities now lie beyond the larger indices. “I am not bullish on large cap earnings. This market is more small cap market. The real growth will be beyond Nifty100 and Nifty200 companies,” he noted.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\t‘Health of the market is very robust’</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGaurav Misra, head–equity at Mirae Asset, described India’s market as fundamentally strong and diverse. He, however, said the valuations, at an aggregate, may be higher right now.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that the low inflation environment is shaping a moderate growth outlook. “This year, inflation has been very low. So we're looking at a sub 10 per cent nominal growth,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting the importance of established sectors, Misra added, “Big entities like automobiles or banks can't be left behind if India is going to become a $5 trillion and $7 trillion economy.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, urged investors to remain patient and long-term focused.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Valuations have time-corrected, but not enough,” he said. “Equities is a long-term asset class, you need to be disciplined and stay invested, and focus on fundamentals.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Gubbi, the earnings cycle may be nearing a turning point. “We are pretty much at the bottom of the earnings downgrade cycle. Earnings have not recovered dramatically, the expectations have been lowered,” he added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\t‘India yet to fully participate in global equity rally’</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHari Shyamsunder, vice-president and senior client portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, said India has underperformed compared to the ongoing global equity rally. “There is a global equity bull market happening right now, and we have not participated,” he said. “Our industry's earnings disappointed.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, he believes that the outlook is improving. “Global equities are rallying, but India’s muted participation stems from last year’s strong run and earnings lag. The good news is the extent of disappointment is narrowing, setting the stage for the next catalyst.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShyamsunder also pointed to the importance of fundamentals in valuation. “You can create a full valuation framework using growth, return on equity and cost of equity,” he said, adding that “many of the IPOs are not profit making\", which calls for more selective investing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile valuations across the Indian market remain elevated, industry experts agreed that the underlying growth story is still intact.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is focusing on promoting the responsible use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence in financial markets, strengthening cyber resilience, and preparing entities for quantum readiness, Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Friday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit, Pandey said technology would continue to redefine market functioning — from algorithmic trading to investment decisions. “True resilience lies in foresight — the ability to read trends early, anticipate risks, and prepare the system to withstand shocks. Building such capability, both within Sebi and across market institutions, will remain our key priority,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Sebi chief said India’s capital markets had become a key pillar of economic growth, underpinned by reforms that had made them more efficient, inclusive, and resilient. India’s financial system, he noted, now functions as an interconnected ecosystem linking banks, corporates, mutual funds, insurers, pension funds, and fintechs through a web of transactions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“These linkages bring efficiency and expand access to capital, but they also make the system more complex. A disruption in one segment can transmit rapidly to another,” he cautioned, stressing the need for coordination through the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite global challenges such as shifting trade policies, rising debt, and geopolitical tensions, Pandey said India’s financial system had remained stable. This resilience, he added, reflects the shared commitment of regulators and market participants to safeguard stability while enabling growth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe highlighted the widening reach of India’s capital markets, with the number of unique investors rising from about 40 million in FY19 to over 135 million. Market capitalisation has increased from 69 per cent of GDP in FY16 to around 129 per cent, while companies have raised nearly ₹7 trillion through equity and debt issuances in the current financial year till September. Investor participation from smaller towns is also growing, with about 18 per cent of mutual fund assets now originating from beyond the top 30 cities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey outlined several reforms aimed at strengthening market structure and investor protection. These include stronger governance frameworks for exchanges and clearing corporations, tighter liquidity norms and stress testing for mutual funds, and improved transparency in the corporate bond market. Sebi has also revised norms for SME IPOs and equity derivatives to ensure market integrity.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo enhance ease of doing business, Sebi has simplified IPO and listing processes, digitised filings, streamlined KYC norms, and proposed relaxed requirements for NRIs. It has also set clear approval timelines and improved grievance redressal.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey said Sebi continues to foster market innovation. The regulator has expanded the scope of strategic investors in REITs and InvITs, reclassified REITs as equity for mutual fund investments, and introduced put options in non-convertible securities to enhance liquidity. Incentives have been revised to encourage mutual fund participation from women and investors in smaller towns, while Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) have been granted more flexibility under accredited investor-only schemes.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Collectively, these reforms have simplified operations, improved business conditions, strengthened governance, and reduced systemic risk — laying the foundation for a marketplace that is both resilient and welcoming to long-term capital,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRejecting the notion that regulation and growth are opposing forces, Pandey said well-designed regulation can support both. “The shorter T+1 settlement cycle increased efficiency and reduced systemic exposure simultaneously,” he noted, adding that improved disclosures and governance have enhanced the credibility of Indian listed entities globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPandey said Sebi is reviewing its regulatory framework to make it simpler and more contemporary. “Investor protection is not only about regulation; it begins with understanding,” he said, adding that the regulator will continue expanding financial literacy campaigns in regional languages.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“As we look to the future, our focus must remain on building a financial system that is strong yet agile, innovative yet responsible, and inclusive yet resilient,” Pandey concluded.</div></div>",

A new study published in the journal <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> suggests it can. The coronavirus may have lasting effects beyond the mother, potentially influencing how a baby’s brain develops.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tResearchers at Mass General Brigham, a leading research and academic medical centre in Boston that includes a network of hospitals, found that children born to mothers who had <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/pandemic-accelerated-brain-ageing-covid-study-uk-biobank-mental-health-causes-and-symptoms-125072500549_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Covid-19</a> during pregnancy faced a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, speech delays and motor coordination issues by the time they turned three.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe study, titled <em>Neurodevelopmental outcomes of 3-year-old children exposed to maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in utero</em>, analysed more than 18,000 births that took place during the first year of the pandemic.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>What did the study find?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe researchers tracked 18,124 mother–child pairs from March 2020 to May 2021. Among them, 861 women had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. By the time their children turned three, 16.3 per cent of those born to Covid-positive mothers had received a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, compared with 9.7 per cent of children whose mothers had not been infected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAfter adjusting for confounding factors such as age and pre-existing conditions, maternal Covid-19 infection was linked to a 29 per cent higher likelihood of <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/vaccines-autism-myth-doctors-debunk-sridhar-vembu-remarks-125102901122_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">neurodevelopmental disorders in children</a>.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Which children were most at risk?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe study found that male children were more likely to develop these disorders than female children. The highest risk appeared when the infection occurred during the third trimester, a crucial phase for brain development.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDr Andrea Edlow, senior author and Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham, explained in a press statement that “Covid-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother but to fetal brain development.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAnimal studies have shown that immune activation during pregnancy — the body’s inflammatory response to infection — can disrupt fetal brain development, which may help explain these findings.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong>Are all Covid-exposed babies at high risk?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe researchers emphasised that the overall risk remains low. Dr Roy Perlis, co-senior author from Mass General’s Department of Psychiatry, said in the statement that although infection increases the odds of developmental disorders, “the overall risk of adverse outcomes in exposed children likely remains low.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThis means that most babies born to mothers who had Covid-19 during <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/who-eu-trump-tylenol-autism-paracetamol-safety-pregnancy-125092300974_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">pregnancy </a>are likely to develop normally, but some may benefit from early developmental screening and support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tAccording to the study, the link between infections in pregnancy and later neurodevelopmental conditions is not new. Influenza, rubella and Zika virus have all been associated with an increased risk of autism or developmental disorders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe researchers believe the effect may not stem from the virus directly crossing the placenta, but rather from maternal immune responses and inflammation that subtly alter the environment in which the fetal brain develops.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h2>\n<strong>What about Covid-19 vaccines and prevention?</strong></h2>\n<div>\r\n\t\tBecause the study’s timeframe was during the first pandemic year, most mothers involved were unvaccinated. This allowed researchers to isolate the effects of infection itself. However, the findings have renewed emphasis on the importance of preventing infection during pregnancy, particularly through vaccination.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDr Edlow added that “these results are especially relevant at a time when public trust in vaccines, including Covid-19 vaccines, is being eroded.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe study highlighted that Covid-19 during pregnancy is not a guarantee of neurodevelopmental problems, but it should be avoided.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLead author Dr Lydia Shook advised parents to stay aware: “By understanding the risks, parents can advocate for their children to receive proper evaluation and developmental support.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div></div><div><blockquote class=\"blockquoteBG styleQ1\" style=\"background-color:#FFF5EB;padding:8px;overflow:hidden\">\n<p>\n<strong>Since you're already here</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\t\t\t…and clearly interested in your health, take a moment to explore our varied range of stories on wellness, medical research, and public health insights.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCaught flu despite the jab?<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/health/why-flu-vaccine-does-not-guarantee-immunity-doctor-explains-125101400667_1.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Why did I catch the flu even after taking the vaccine?

The company may use the unit at Maraimalai Nagar factory in the outskirts of the city as an export hub, with an annual production capacity of 235,000 units and production expected to start in 2029.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBuilding on a letter of intent signed in September 2024, representatives of the company and the Tamil Nadu government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that outlines a strategy to leverage India’s “manufacturing prowess” for Ford plans. Senior company executives met Chief Minister M K Stalin on Friday. Sources said the plant will have an annual capacity of 235,000 units and start production in 2029.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe MoU complements Ford India’s existing manufacturing infrastructure to produce and export engines. “We are pleased to advance our plans and confirm the Chennai plant’s vital role in Ford’s manufacturing network,” said Jeff Marentic, president of international markets group, Ford Motor Company.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are thankful to the government of Tamil Nadu for its continued support as we advance these plans. This decision reinforces our commitment to leveraging India's manufacturing prowess for future products,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDetails about engines the Chennai plant will produce and export markets will be shared closer to the start of production.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Ford’s decision to commence manufacturing in Chennai will further energise the resurgent automotive sector of Tamil Nadu and it speaks volumes about the state's robust manufacturing ecosystem, highly skilled workforce, and excellent investor facilitation,” said Tamil Nadu Industries Minister T R B Rajaa.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe announcement comes two years after Ford stopped production at the Maraimalai Nagar factory in August 2022. Maramalai Nagar is considered as a lucrative destination as it is hardly 50 kms away from Chennai port and 74 kms from Ennore port. In addition to its proximity to Chennai, the plant is easily accessible to Bengaluru too, which is only 320 kms away by road. During the time of its exit, Ford India was staring at accumulated losses to the tune of around $2 billion over a decade that the company. At that time, through brands like EcoSport and Endeavour SUVs, it had a less than a 2 per cent share of the country's passenger vehicle market</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This is not just the start of manufacturing at the existing Ford facility, it is the State taking yet another step towards the future of the automotive industry with the production of next-gen engines. We remain committed to supporting Ford's operations here,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestment in the plant is expected to create more than 600 jobs, besides indirect employment in the automotive industry. Ford employs 12,000 people at its global business operations unit in Tamil Nadu. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
