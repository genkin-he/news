As the APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLee's office said Nvidia will supply around 260,000 GPUs to support South Korea's AI computing capabilities. The company will also work with Samsung and other South Korean technology firms, including SK Hynix and Hyundai, to improve manufacturing processes using AI and to accelerate the development of new technologies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSanta Clara-based Nvidia, whose GPU chips power much of the global AI industry, featured in talks Thursday between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Gyeongju, where the leaders agreed to take steps to ease their escalating trade war.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFollowing the meeting, Trump said he discussed sales of computer chips to China. Trump and former President Joe Biden have imposed restrictions on China's access to the most advanced chips, including those used for AI. Trump said China will speak with Nvidia about purchasing its chips, but not the company's latest Blackwell AI chips.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15 per cent cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut there are also concerns over a potential AI bubble. Officials at the Bank of England warned earlier this month that tech stock prices fueled by the AI boom could collapse, and the head of the International Monetary Fund has issued a similar warning.</p><p></p></div>",

This mix creates a treasure trove of data that attackers want to capture — for profit, surveillance, or competitive advantage.”</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What spyware does and why it’s dangerous</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSpyware is a stealth software program that secretly installs itself on a user’s device to collect confidential information without consent. Unlike typical malware, spyware does not usually damage the operating system but instead monitors and records user activity — including keystrokes, screen captures, browsing habits, and login credentials.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSuch attacks can compromise passwords, PINs, account details, and personal communications, leading to major privacy breaches and corporate espionage.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Commercial spyware: a growing global threat</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tKaspersky’s report also flagged the rise of commercial spyware, a form of “legal malware” sold to governments and law enforcement agencies but increasingly misused against private organisations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThese sophisticated tools can intercept messages, track locations, eavesdrop on calls, and erase traces of their presence — often through zero-click vulnerabilities, meaning users don’t have to click on any links or attachments to get infected.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India’s spyware exposure widens</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe report showed that spyware incidents against Indian businesses rose from 58,578 in H1 2024 to 2,18,479 in H1 2025, underscoring how cybercriminals are scaling their operations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The fact that spyware campaigns exploit both cutting-edge and older unpatched systems shows how persistent these actors are,” Singh added. “This is where threat intelligence becomes essential — helping organisations understand which spyware tools are active, how they operate, and where defences should be strengthened.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Strengthening enterprise defences</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSecurity analysts note that the sharp rise in spyware incidents calls for proactive cybersecurity investments, especially in sectors handling sensitive data like finance, healthcare, and technology.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tExperts recommend stronger endpoint protection, employee awareness programmes, real-time monitoring, and zero-trust architecture to mitigate such attacks.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Heading into the final match, the Tigers will look to salvage pride and end the series on a positive note before turning attention to upcoming fixtures.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/abhishek-nayar-named-new-kolkata-knight-riders-head-coach-ahead-of-ipl-2026-125103001463_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Abhishek Nayar named new Kolkata Knight Riders head coach ahead of IPL 2026</a></strong></div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Bangladesh vs West Indies Probable Playing 11 </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Bangladesh playing 11: </strong>Litton Das (C &amp; WK), Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Saif Hassan, Towhid Hridoy, Jaker Ali, Shamim Hossain, Rishad Hossain, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>West Indies Playing 11: </strong>Brandon King, Alick Athanaze, Shai Hope (C &amp; WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Roston Chase, Rovman Powell, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Khary Pierre, Jayden Seales</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Bangladesh vs West Indies head-to-head stats</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTotal matches played: 21</div>\n<div>\r\n\tBAN won: 8</div>\n<div>\r\n\tWI won: 11</div>\n<div>\r\n\tNo result: 2</div>\n<div>\r\n\tAbandoned: 0</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Squad of both teams:</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Bangladesh squad: </strong>Litton Das(w/c), Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Saif Hassan, Parvez Hossain Emon, Jaker Ali, Shamim Hossain, Mahedi Hasan, Nurul Hasan, Nasum Ahmed, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Towhid Hridoy, Tanzim Hasan Sakib</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>West Indies squad: </strong>Brandon King, Alick Athanaze, Shai Hope(w/c), Sherfane Rutherford, Roston Chase, Rovman Powell, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Khary Pierre, Jayden Seales, Ramon Simmonds, Ackeem Auguste, Amir Jangoo, Gudakesh Motie</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 live match time, BAN vs WI 3rd T20 free live telecast and streaming</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>When will Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 take place?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe third match between Bangladesh and West Indies will take place on Wednesday (October 31).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the venue of BAN vs WI 3rd T20?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBir Shreshtho Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium in Chattogram will host Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 International on Friday.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 live toss time?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe BAN vs WI 3rd T20 live toss will take place at 5:00 PM IST.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is the live match time for Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 match?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 live match will begin at 5:30 PM IST.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Which TV channels will live telecast Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 match in India?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe live telecast for the BAN vs WI 3rd T20 match will not be available in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How to watch the live streaming of Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 match in India?</strong></div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCricket fans can watch the live streaming of Bangladesh vs West Indies 3rd T20 match on the FanCode app and website.</div></div>",

This story of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) is told here through the biography of its second principal, Jagat Murari, who, in its first decade, took the institution to its greatest heights.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe author, Radha Chadha, is Murari’s daughter. She has shaped her narrative by using a treasure trove of journals, official papers, news reports and photographs that Murari left behind in three packed cupboards. She has given life to these documents by interviewing more than a hundred people over the last 10 years — students, teachers, officials, journalists — who have given first-hand accounts of their life at the institute.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tAfter over a decade as a documentary filmmaker, Murari came to the institute in 1961 and became its head a year later. This was in every sense a pioneering venture — no such institute existed in India and those working in the film industry usually had no formal training. Ms Chadha describes her father as “an idealistic man consumed by a passion to create the school of his dreams” as he painstakingly developed the syllabus, appointed faculty, and acquired expensive facilities for the diverse courses.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe students who joined in this early period had hardly any knowledge of cinema. Murari’s instruction to his students was simple; they had “to think in original terms and give full expression to their individual personalities” and develop their own “directorial style”. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe students enthusiastically devoured films such as Battleship Potemkin, Citizen Kane, Bicycle Thieves, Rashomon, Wild Strawberries, Breathless, La Dolce Vita, that had been made by some of the greatest directors of all time — Sergei Eisenstein, Orson Welles, Vittorio De Sica, Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Jean Luc Godard, and Federico Fellini — besides the masterpieces of Indian masters Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, and Mrinal Sen. Many of these stalwarts visited the FTII and held lectures.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe impact of this teaching and exposure changed the face of Indian cinema as the institute’s graduates — Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Girish Kasaravalli, John Abraham — shaped the “new wave” with films reflecting a creative understanding of the human spirit along with a command over the latest cinematic technology. The institute’s graduates also impacted mainstream (Hindi) cinema and regional cinema; these included: Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Subhash Ghai, and actors such as Jaya Bachchan,  Shatrughan  Sinha, Sadhu Meher, Shabana Azmi, Mithun Chakraborty, Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, and many more.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tMs Chadha also discusses some of the issues that unsettled the institute. Towards the end of the first decade, direction students, heavily influenced by some aspects of world cinema, insisted they would not use the acting students in their diploma films — the latter, they said, were influenced by mainstream cinema and hence not suited for their endeavours that required “authenticity”, largely by using non-professional actors. This led to frequent unrest and strikes, the last of which caused Murari’s departure from the institute in 1971.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThis also caused a prolonged malaise in the institution as a clueless government deployed one ill-chosen head after another, which only worsened the situation. Administration collapsed, examinations were seriously delayed, diploma films remained incomplete, teaching was deficient — and admissions dropped drastically. The government sent Murari back to the institute to improve matters in 1976, but it was too late. He described the situation as “someone [having] taken aim and wielded a wrecking ball” at the institution he had so lovingly nurtured.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThe last 50 pages make very painful reading. The film institute now manifested the rot that characterises several institutions of higher learning in India — an incompetent faculty more intent on political mischief than academic excellence, an undisciplined student body whose gang leaders usually went unpunished due to political intervention, and frequent governmental interference based on quick appeasement rather than seriously addressing complex issues with patience and gravitas.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tIn 1979, Murari resigned from government service after experiencing a humiliating gherao in his office, surrounded by students who shamelessly blew cigarette smoke into his face and denied him drinking water. The shock of his departure speeded up urgently needed reforms: The institute was made autonomous; the old syllabus, which had been tinkered with several times, was restored, and new and well-qualified faculty was brought in.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tThis book is an excellent study of the early period of a major national institution. But it is also valuable for the light it sheds on how institutions, built over years, can decay quickly due to  the venal conduct of its guardians. Looking back, we can see Murari as the pioneer who traversed pathways that he had to create himself. And, like most pioneers, he got little understanding or backing from an untutored and sceptical bureaucracy and political leadership, and inadequate support from ill-qualified colleagues, many of whom fomented intrigue and discord.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\r\n\tToday, four decades later, we recognise Murari’s extraordinary achievement in shaping a world-class film school and opening vistas of artistic achievement to hundreds of filmmakers who have transformed cinema in India and obtained plaudits the world over. Murari is now justly recognised as “the maker of filmmakers”.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<hr/>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<em><strong>The reviewer is a former diplomat who is also an incorrigible film buff</strong></em></div></div>",

Equities is the longest-duration asset class. You have to have a long-term view,” he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed out that India’s transformation over the past decade has been fundamental, particularly in reducing its external vulnerabilities. At the centre of which lies its saving deficit or current account deficit, he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our oil dependency has gone down 60 per cent. Our economy has quadrupled since 2008, and our oil import bill has gone up 80 per cent during the period. It is no longer consequential to our fundamental account, which means we are not running such a large savings deficit,” Desai said, explaining how India’s rapid economic growth and reduced reliance on imported energy have lowered the impact of oil on the current account.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/markets/mutual-fund/mutual-funds-indian-markets-investors-volatility-bfsi-summit-2025-125103100497_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual fund leaders urge investors to stay the course amid volatility</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother reason for his optimism is the rise of the global capability centres (GCCs). “One of the silver linings of Covid-19 is that multinational corporations (MNCs) realised it is okay to work from home. It is okay to work from Mumbai, which is cheaper than Florida. It has triggered a big boom of GCCs. They exported $70 billion of services in the past 12 months and it is going to double in the next four to five years,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs a result, Desai said India’s current account deficit has fallen below 1 per cent, making the economy less dependent on foreign portfolio inflows.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are not so dependent on global capital market flows like we used to be. When you are not dependent on capital market flows, the beta of the market goes down. It was 1.3 in 2013. Today, India’s beta is 0.4. It’s a quintessential defensive market,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBeta is a measure of a market’s volatility or sensitivity relative to the global equity market. A beta above 1 indicates that a market is more volatile, while a beta below 1 suggests lower volatility and greater stability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDesai further explained that India’s relative underperformance this year is a function of global trends, and it will perform better during the global downcycle.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The most proximate reason why India has not done well this year is that we’ve been in a raging global equity bull market, and India is not going to do well. It’s a consumer staple stock. Consumer staple stocks don’t do well. When the next bear market arrives, India will flourish,” he said.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/markets/news/sebi-chairman-tuhin-kanta-pandey-financial-markets-investors-nse-ipo-125103100427_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Confidence of foreign investors in India remains strong, says Sebi chief</a></strong></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking about threats to market growth, he said the risks largely lie outside its borders.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The world is looking very messy. It is sitting on record debt and is ageing. We as a race have not figured out how to reverse the declining population,” he said, adding that while India appears to be stable, this could be a potential threat.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDomestically, Desai identified agriculture as a key sector requiring reform. We have approximately 200 million farmers, and the farm reforms that were proposed a few years ago were extremely bright and necessary, he opined. “We need to lift our farmers out of poverty. Otherwise, the remaining 1.1 billion people who don’t depend on farming will race ahead,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe said India’s low farm productivity limits its potential, adding that matching China’s efficiency could make the country’s farm economy worth $2 trillion and enable it to feed half the world.</div></div>",

The state, with 243 assembly seats, will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, and the results will be announced on November 14.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmid high-stakes campaigning, major parties and alliances are gearing up for a neck-and-neck battle. Speculation is rife over whether long-serving Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will return, or if Bihar will choose a new leadership. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is yet to announce its chief ministerial candidate, casting doubt over Kumar’s comeback. On the other hand, the opposition INDIA bloc has named Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as its CM face.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs political temperatures rise, several constituencies are expected to play a decisive role in determining the outcome. Here are six key constituencies to watch in the Bihar Assembly elections 2025:</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t1. Raghopur (Vaishali district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tRaghopur, in Vaishali district, is the seat of Tejashwi Yadav. It has been a stronghold of his family, with both his parents, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi, having represented it earlier. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Satish Kumar Yadav, a locally rooted leader who blends political experience with an agrarian background. If Tejashwi loses Raghopur, it would be seen as a major setback for the RJD and could signal a change in the political landscape in Bihar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t2. Mahua (Vaishali district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tMahua, which is near Vaishali, has also come to the spotlight as Tej Pratap Yadav, Tejashwi's estranged brother, is contesting after floating his own political outfit. Tej Pratap, who was disowned by his family and the RJD, will look to make strong inroads into a constituency which has a strong Yadav population, along with many Scheduled Caste and Muslim voters. He will be up against sitting RJD MLA Mukesh Kumar Raushan and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) candidate Sanjay Kumar Singh.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/elections/bihar-elections/tejashwi-accuses-nda-of-exploiting-bihar-urges-voters-to-drive-them-out-125103000486_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tejashwi accuses NDA of exploiting Bihar, urges voters to 'drive them out'</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t3. Lakhisarai (Munger region)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tLakhisarai is the home seat of BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha. It has long been a safe seat for the NDA. The area’s voters mainly include OBCs, Yadavs, and Bhumihars. If the BJP wins here again, it will prove that its support in rural Bihar remains solid. Sinha is likely to be challenged by Jan Suraaj's Suraj Kumar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t4. Patna Sahib (Urban Patna)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPatna Sahib, in the state capital, is one of the most important urban constituencies. The seat has been with the BJP for years and is seen as a test of its popularity among city voters, professionals, youth, and the middle class. Winning here would strengthen the BJP’s image in urban Bihar, while a loss could hint at changing moods in the capital. BJP's Ratnesh Kushwaha will be contesting from the Patna Sahib seat. He will be up against Congress leader Shashant Shekhar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t5. Tarapur (Munger district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tOver the decades, Tarapur has seen a diverse political representation, with the Congress winning five times from this seat, while the Janata Dal (United) has secured victory six times. Meanwhile, the RJD has claimed the seat thrice. However, this time it is being seen as a BJP stronghold, with senior BJP leader Samrat Choudhary contesting from his family’s ancestral area, making it a high-stakes battle. Coudhary will be up against RJD’s Arun Kumar.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\t6. Phulwari (SC reserved seat, Patna district)</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tPhulwari, a reserved seat for Scheduled Castes in Patna district, has a mix of Dalit, Muslim, and other communities. It reflects many of Bihar’s key issues, such as caste balance, reservation, and development in semi-urban areas. The result here could indicate how other reserved seats across the state might vote.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSitting MLA and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation's leader Gopal Ravidas will be challenged by former MLA and Janata Dal United (JDU) leader Shyam Rajak. Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) has fielded Shashi Kant Prasad on the seat.</div></div>",
