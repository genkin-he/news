By rejecting the bids, the RBI conveyed its discomfort with elevated yield levels, leading to a softening in yields by the end of the trading session.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe government had planned to sell ₹11,000 crore worth of 6.28 per cent 2032 bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond settled at 6.53 per cent, down from the previous close of 6.57 per cent, after touching an intraday high of 6.6 per cent.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The bidding was around 6.6 per cent — roughly the same level at which the 10-year benchmark was trading. Given that the seven-year is an illiquid bond, mainly held by banks, bidders sought a higher yield,” said the treasury head at a private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“If the RBI had accepted those bids, it would have sent the wrong signal to the market and pushed yields even higher. That’s why the RBI rejected them,” the treasury head added.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt the time of the auction, the seven-year bond was trading at 6.46 per cent, later easing to 6.43 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMarket participants said public-sector banks (PSBs) were completely absent from the auction. Dealers said that bidding weakened after a technical breakout at 6.56 per cent, with many PSBs already sitting on large mark-to-market losses, making them reluctant to take on additional risk. Some expect yields to breach 6.6 per cent and possibly retest 6.65 per cent, prompting state-run banks to remain on the sidelines.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“PSBs were completely absent from the seven-year paper. The bidding was weak after the technical breakout at 6.56 per cent. They’re already holding large loss positions, so it’s riskier for them to buy more,” said a dealer at a primary dealership.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnother market participant noted that banks are not adding bonds to their held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“After the change in investment portfolio norms came into effect on April 1, 2024, banks are reluctant to add bonds to their HTM portfolios. The seven-year bond is usually kept in the HTM book of PSBs, but with yields rising, nobody wants to take that risk,” said the treasury head at another private bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the RBI’s revised framework, banks must categorise their entire bond investment portfolio into three buckets —HTM, available-for-sale (AFS), and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The new rules merge the earlier held-for-trading sub-category into FVTPL.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBanks are no longer allowed to reclassify investments between HTM, AFS, and FVTPL without board and regulatory approval. Securities under the held-for-trading sub-category within FVTPL must be fair-valued daily, while other FVTPL securities are to be valued at least quarterly, or more frequently if required.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the new norms, bonds classified as HTM must remain there permanently, except for up to 5 per cent of the portfolio that can be shifted during the year.</div></div>",

It had in June signed an MoU with Hindustan Copper to collaborate in copper and critical minerals.

(GCPL) has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the FMCG business under the ‘Muuchstac’ brand via slump sale from Trilogy Solutions for approximately ₹449 crore as it aims to drive profitable growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe deal will be done in two tranches and is an all-cash deal. In the first tranche, GCPL will make a payment of ₹289 crore for an enterprise value of ₹380 crore, and the second tranche will be 12 months later for approximately ₹160 crore at an enterprise value of ₹400-500 crore, it said in its stock exchange filing. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This brand is one of the India’s fastest-growing men’s grooming brands with a strong leadership position in the men’s facewash segment. This acquisition marks a strategic step in GCPL’s journey to strengthen its personal care portfolio and expand its footprint in high-growth, high-margin categories,” it said in its release.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Muuchstac brand is currently among the top two player in the men’s online facewash category and hold the top three spot overall, and in 12 months ending September 2025, the business recorded revenues of approximately ₹80 crore and EBITDA (adjusted for one-offs) of around ₹30 crore. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Indian facewash market, estimated at ₹6,000–7,000 crore, is growing at 15–20 per cent per annum, driven by rising awareness of skincare and an ongoing shift from soaps to more specialised cleansing formats. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Within this, the men’s facewash category, valued at about ₹1,000 crore, is growing at over 25 per cent annually, making it one of the fastest-growing segments in personal care. The upgradation trend from soaps to facewash, supported by higher disposable incomes, and changing grooming preferences, is expected to sustain strong momentum in the coming years,” the release added. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are delighted to welcome Muuchstac brand to Godrej Consumer Products. The brand’s strong resonance among younger consumers, high profitability, and proven digital execution model make it a powerful addition to our personal care portfolio. This acquisition enhances our participation in the fast-growing men’s grooming segment and supports our vision of building a future-ready, innovation-led GCPL,” Sudhir Sitapati, managing director &amp; chief executive officer at GCPL said in the release.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonak Bagadia and Vishal Lohia, founders of Muuchstac, said that they look forward to the business scaling ahead, on their vision of redefining men’s skincare in India and also said that they will work closely with the team at Godrej for the same. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the July-September quarter, GCPL’s consolidated net profit fell 6.5 per cent to ₹459.3 crore. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts net sales grew 4.3 per cent to ₹3,825.1 crore. It reported a volume growth of 3 per cent in the quarter under review in the domestic business.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIts profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 5.8 per cent in the quarter ended September to ₹796.2 crore. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCommenting on its results, Sitapati said, “Q2 FY26 has been a resilient quarter for Godrej Consumer Products Limited, especially given the backdrop of the GST transition in India and continued macroeconomic challenges in Indonesia. Despite these headwinds, our India business, excluding soaps, has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth, reflecting the strength of our core portfolio and execution.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also said that the recent GST rate reduction is a welcome structural reform that will strengthen long-term consumer demand. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs warned by the company ahead of its earnings, Sitapati said in the release, “However, this transition led to short-term trade disruptions as the channel adjusted to new pricing and cleared old inventory, particularly impacting soaps and hair colour. Despite this, we continue to gain market share in soaps and other key categories.” </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe added that in October, the company entered the ₹3,000 crore toilet cleaner category segment, which is growing at strong double digits. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Our new brand, Godrej Spic, has been launched in select south Indian states, priced competitively at ₹79 for 500 ml, marking an important step in expanding our Home Care portfolio,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
