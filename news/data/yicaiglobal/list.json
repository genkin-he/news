In terms of overall NEV shipments, which includes plug-in hybrids, BYD has now ranked first for four straight years.</p><p>BYD’s sales of pure electric cars soared 28 percent last year from the year before to 2.3 million vehicles, the Shenzhen-based automaker said on Jan. 2.</p><p>By contrast, Tesla’s shipments, which were reported on the same day, tumbled 8.6 percent to 1.6 million vehicles in the Austin-based firm’s second consecutive year of declines. The drop has also widened substantially from the 1.1 percent slide logged the previous year.</p><p>BYD’s plug-in hybrid sales slumped 8 percent to 2.3 million units, bringing its overall NEV deliveries in 2025 to 4.6 million units, a year-on-year jump of 8 percent, it added.</p><p>BYD, which started out in 1995 as a manufacturer of lithium batteries, has grown into one of China’s leading makers of electric cars and power batteries. The company stopped producing gasoline-powered autos altogether in 2022 and that same year, its NEV sales surpassed Tesla’s for the first time, earning the top spot globally. In 2024, BYD overtook SAIC Motor to become China’s biggest automaker by sales.</p><p>Rapid expansion overseas has been a key driver of BYD’s growth. In 2025, its sales of passenger cars and pickups abroad surged 145 percent from the year before to one million units, according to company data. The firm’s global footprint has expanded to 110 countries and regions.</p><p>In response to growing uncertainty in international trade, BYD is accelerating the localization of production abroad. Since 2024, the company has built plants in Thailand, Uzbekistan and Brazil. Its first European factory, located in Hungary, is set to be completed and to start production later this year.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

            "description": "<div data-cover=\"https://img.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/02/112020362526405.jpg\" id=\"news-body\"><p>(Yicai) Feb.18 -- At 10 a.m. sharp, two 1.3-meter-tall humanoid robots in a storefront in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province, sprang to life, twisting and turning in perfect sync to a rhythmic beat. The conclusion of their dance coincided with the country's first-ever 7S humanoid robot store officially opening for its daily business.</p><p>Much like the automotive 4S shops, this novel concept aims to be a one-stop hub. But instead of cars, it focuses on humanoid robots. The 7S model builds on the traditional automobile 4S concept, namely sales, service, spare parts and surveys, by adding solution, show and school functions, thereby covering the entire industrial chain from components and whole machines to scenario-based applications.</p><p>Since opening in November 2025, this store in Wuhan, run by Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, has become a landmark of a shopping mall in the Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, also known as the Optics Valley of China, a tech hub in Hubei.</p><p>China's humanoid robot industry saw significant growth throughout 2025, backed by national and local government mid-to-long-term plans targeting it as a strategic sector. The 7S store represents a pioneering step in exploring viable commercial models and market acceptance for this transformative technology.</p><p>\"In nearly two months, we've received approximately 18,000 visits, becoming a popular tech destination in Wuhan for both locals and tourists,\" said store manager Hu Longdan.</p><p>\"Cumulative revenue has reached almost CNY615,000 (about USD88,600). Humanoid robots are very popular for rentals, having served 10 plus commercial events, while experience projects featuring robot dogs and robot soccer have become major attractions for the youth,\" Hu noted.</p><p>Inside the bustling store, robots of various sizes and shapes demonstrate their capabilities: some play soccer, others serve as retail assistants, while another group plays musical instruments.</p><p>\"We have 17 different models of humanoid robots here, priced from CNY149 to CNY700,000. They can be deployed in over 10 scenarios including industrial manufacturing, cultural tourism guidance, elderly care and special operations,\" said Hu.</p><p>China has intensified its efforts to foster future industries like embodied AI, as outlined in the proposals for the formulation of the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030). The goal is to cultivate new economic growth engines through technological innovation and market exploration.</p><p>The 7S store in Wuhan is part of a national wave of robot-themed retail experiments to promote real-life application of humanoid robots, a key phase for the development of the industry. A think tank report forecasts that by 2045, China will have over 100 million humanoid robots deployed across industries, creating a total market value of approximately CNY10 trillion.</p><p>In July last year, a robot 6S store, said to be the world's first, opened in Shenzhen, a tech hub in south China. A month later, Beijing's Robot Mall, a 4,000-square-meter robot 4S showroom, debuted during a robot consumption festival, featuring more than 50 products spanning medical, industrial and companion robotics.</p><p>The Wuhan store, notably, features a schooling function, addressing the \"last mile\" of skill development, thus standing out when compared to its peers.</p><p>This means the Wuhan store is not just a sales venue but also a \"hands-on experience center\" offering interactive engagement and skills enhancement. Staff members highlight that the store provides robotics operator training, maintenance technician certification and introductory courses for teenagers.</p><p>In addition, corporate engineers can acquire practical skills in operating and maintaining humanoid robots on-site, while middle school students can learn programming and logic through hands-on activities.</p><p>\"We've held 20 sessions, including eight instances of operator training, 12 youth courses and two teacher training events, involving over 1,000 participants,\" said Hu.</p><p>About 65 percent of the trainees are youths, primarily students building foundational skills. Professionals, like engineers and teachers, accounting for 35 percent, seek operational and maintenance expertise. Over 50 professionals, meanwhile, have gained basic robot operation skills via the store programs, Hu revealed.</p><p>The store exemplifies the region's integrated supply chain.</p><p>A key attraction near the store entrance is Yuan You, meaning Far Traveler in English, which is a wheel-footed robot standing 158 cm tall and weighing 72 kg.</p><p>\"It can walk 1.5 meters per second,\" Hu said. \"It's a Hubei native and has been 'working' for nine months at a hospital in the city of Xianning in Hubei, providing guidance, explanations and even moxibustion therapy services.\"</p><p>Yuan Chao, general manager of Wuhan HandX Innovation Technology Co., Ltd, developer of Yuan You, noted that a team from the prestigious Wuhan University had provided both solutions for sensors and AI technology for this robot, while Hubei's local industrial chain supplied over 80 percent of the hardware.</p><p>\"Hubei has roughly 20 core humanoid robot supply chain enterprises and nearly a thousand related firms, allowing us to procure key components like the 'brain,' 'skeleton' and 'electronic skin,'\" Yuan added.</p><p>The first Yuan You was born in April 2025 after just six months of R&amp;D and is now in mass production, with four automated lines capable of producing 1,500 units annually.</p><p>Ensuring these robots are not just produced, but are also capable of performing effectively, is crucial. In June 2025, Hubei established a school for humanoids, known as the Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center. There, newly-born robots are trained by data collectors.</p><p>\"We provide 23 high-fidelity simulation scenarios and over 10 temporary ones, capable of training hundreds of robots simultaneously, collecting more than a million real-machine data points annually,\" said Liu Chuanhou, chief operating officer of the center.</p><p>\"This data, after review, labeling and cleaning, is used for large-model training, enabling continuous robot evolution,\" Liu explained.</p><p>To propel robots from training to real-world value creation, Wuhan has released a three-year action plan and supportive policies, encouraging the development of diverse application scenarios.</p><p>Dong Danhong, director of the Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau, noted that the focus is on unlocking scenarios in hazardous/special operations, manufacturing activities like in the automotive sector, and public services such as elderly care and education.</p><p>Positioning the store as a national window for humanoid robotics, Hu said the 7S store is aiming to secure more than 100,000 visits in 2026, while hosting over 50 training sessions for more than 3,000 participants, thereby nurturing both youth interest and professional talent.</p><p>\"What humanoid robots can do today is still limited, but in the future, they will surely enter millions of households and serve numerous industries, becoming important members of our lives,\" Hu concluded.</p></div>",

However, mainstream non-volatile memory, such as NAND flash, previously required 5 volts or higher to complete write operations.</p><p>This mismatch lead to the integration of complex circuits for voltage step-up or step-down to enable collaboration between logic and memory units. Such integration resulted in additional power consumption, wasted space, and data transfer bottlenecks between logic and memory.</p><p>In typical AI chips, 60 to 90 percent of total power consumption is used for data transfer rather than computation. This has become one of the core constraints limiting improvements in AI computing power and energy efficiency.</p><p>The team from Peking University led by Qiu Chenguang, a senior researcher, and Peng Lianmao, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has developed nano-gate ferroelectric transistors with an ultralow operation voltage of 0.6 volts, successfully shrinking the physical size of the gate to 1 nanometer.</p><p>Reviewers of Science Advances note that these nano-gate ferroelectric transistor devices exhibit excellent memory performance, for the first time achieving voltage compatibility between ferroelectric memory devices and logic transistors. The physical mechanism behind this technology holds significant implications for the development of the memory sector.</p><p>Qiu said their findings resolve the challenge of voltage incompatibility between memory and logic. Data can now be transferred between memory and computing units at the same low voltage with zero barriers and ultra-low power consumption for high-speed interaction.</p><p>He added that the principle underlying this technology is universal and can be applied to mainstream ferroelectric materials. It can also be mass-produced using standard industrial processes, demonstrating strong industrial compatibility.</p><p>Notably, this technology is expected to be used in large model inference, edge intelligence, wearable devices, and Internet of Things terminals in the future.</p><p>Editor: Dou Shicong</p></div>",

The Ministry of Public Security also released draft auto safety standards last month, which among other things propose that passenger cars should not be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under 5 seconds.</p><p>These rules not only steer innovation in the right direction, but also deliver much-needed protection for consumers in a rapidly changing market, Cisek pointed out. For example, the proposal  to limit acceleration reflects concern about unnecessary performance competition, a stance that aligns well with Volkswagen’s long-standing emphasis on driving safety, he said.</p><p>In response to fierce competition in China’s auto market, Volkswagen is speeding up its strategic transformation. Part of that involves partnering with domestic EV startup Xpeng Motors to jointly develop the China Electrical Architecture, a platform for the electronic and electrical systems in its Chinese cars.</p><p>From next year Volkswagen's three joint ventures in the country will share electrification development platforms, including the CEA. At the same time, Volkswagen Group China Technology based in Hefei, Anhui province will serve as the research and development center responsible for coordinating these efforts, Cisek noted.</p><p>This will help avoid redundant investment while allowing the JVs to tailor products for their specific target users, thereby maximizing synergy, he explained.

The newly designed electrolyte allows batteries to retain nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram even at minus 50 degrees centigrade, compared with the 100 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram typical of commercial batteries today.</p><p>The research, published in Nature yesterday, was conducted by scientists from the College of Chemistry at Nankai University and the Shanghai Institute of Space Power-Sources. The team designed a new fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecule and built an electrolyte system that replaces the conventional lithium-oxygen coordination mode found in mainstream electrolytes.</p><p>Electrolytes serve as the key medium for conducting charged ions between the positive and negative electrodes of lithium batteries. Current mainstream electrolytes consist of lithium salts and carbonate solvents and rely on interactions between lithium and oxygen atoms in the solvent to facilitate dissolution. However, poor wettability limits battery energy density, while restricted charge transfer capacity at low temperatures prevents operation below minus 50 degrees centigrade.</p><p>To overcome these constraints, the Nankai University team proposed replacing oxygen atoms with fluorine atoms to enhance the effective dissolution of lithium salts in the electrolyte. The resulting lithium battery achieved an ultra-high energy density of 700 watt-hours per kilogram at room temperature and maintained nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram at minus 50 degrees centigrade, the research showed.</p><p>For comparison, commercial lithium batteries generally offer energy densities between 100 watt-hours per kilogram and 300 watt-hours per kilogram. The 4680 battery developed by electric vehicle maker Tesla, for instance, has an energy density close to 300 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>High-energy-density batteries based on the new electrolyte have broad application potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots, the low-altitude economy, and aerospace, said Chen Jun, associate president of Nankai University, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Once the EU’s new customs data hub becomes operational, the interim levy will be replaced by standard customs tariffs.</p><p>The change signals the end of the “volume-driven era” for low-margin e-commerce exports, Zhu Qiuyuan, a law professor at Shanghai Customs College, told Yicai. The cost structure of Chinese cross-border e-commerce will face a complete reset, said Zhu, who is also vice president of the Customs Law Research Association of the Shanghai Law Society.</p><p>The EU imported 4.6 billion e-commerce parcels valued below EUR150 in 2024, with 91 percent originating from China, according to data from the European Parliament. Average daily volume reached 12 million parcels, nearly tripling from 2023 and more than tripling from 2022.</p><p>Under the EU’s plan, it will end the EUR150 customs duty exemption threshold from July 1, 2028, imposing unified tariffs and value-added taxes on all imported goods. It will also introduce a simplified “Duty Buckets” classification system, dividing products into five tax tiers of 0 percent, 5 percent, 8 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent to further standardize customs administration for cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>Zhu added that a customs handling fee for e-commerce parcels will take effect this November. The fee will be independent of the EUR3 levy, with specific standards and the final implementation date yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Beyond the EU, the United Kingdom announced in its autumn budget last year that it will end the GBP135 (USD182) customs duty relief, with the current exemption set to be withdrawn by March 2029 at the latest.</p><p>The moves by the EU and UK underscore a clear global trend toward reducing or scrapping low-value import tax exemptions, Zhu said, urging cross-border e-commerce firms and their logistics partners to closely monitor policy developments.</p><p>Zhu also suggested that small and mid-sized sellers use professional third-party service providers or jointly hire customs consultants in Europe to share costs and achieve compliance. At the same time, sellers should gradually strengthen their own compliance awareness and capabilities, he added. </p><p>As tax breaks for small parcels get phased out, timely adjustments to pricing, logistics, and product selection strategies, as well as a shift toward higher value-added and compliant operations, will be critical to maintaining a foothold in the European market, Zhu said.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Revenue soared 43 percent to CNY49.2 billion (USD7.1 billion).</p><p>The earnings were also driven by the price war among China’s delivery platforms. Starting from the second quarter, major platforms began offering big subsidies on freshly made beverages, igniting a fresh growth spurt in the country’s coffee and milk tea markets. Luckin sold 4.1 billion freshly made drinks, which is roughly equivalent to three cups per person in the country.</p><p>The coffee giant opened 8,708 new outlets last year, a 39 percent annual increase, bringing the total number to 31,048. Average monthly active customers surged 31 percent, and the company had more than 100 million for five consecutive months from June. Same-store sales growth at self-operated outlets recovered to 7.5 percent from minus 17 percent the year before.</p><p>Given the high comparative base resulting from generous subsidies from platforms last year, this year’s same-store sales and profit may face some near-term challenges and swings, Chairman and Chief Executive Guo Jinyi said.</p><p>“China's coffee industry is still in its early stages, with significant growth potential,” he said, adding that short-term bumps in the road will not alter the long-term growth trajectory.</p><p>The competitive landscape is changing, though, Guo said.
