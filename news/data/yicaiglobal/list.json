The newly designed electrolyte allows batteries to retain nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram even at minus 50 degrees centigrade, compared with the 100 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram typical of commercial batteries today.</p><p>The research, published in Nature yesterday, was conducted by scientists from the College of Chemistry at Nankai University and the Shanghai Institute of Space Power-Sources. The team designed a new fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecule and built an electrolyte system that replaces the conventional lithium-oxygen coordination mode found in mainstream electrolytes.</p><p>Electrolytes serve as the key medium for conducting charged ions between the positive and negative electrodes of lithium batteries. Current mainstream electrolytes consist of lithium salts and carbonate solvents and rely on interactions between lithium and oxygen atoms in the solvent to facilitate dissolution. However, poor wettability limits battery energy density, while restricted charge transfer capacity at low temperatures prevents operation below minus 50 degrees centigrade.</p><p>To overcome these constraints, the Nankai University team proposed replacing oxygen atoms with fluorine atoms to enhance the effective dissolution of lithium salts in the electrolyte. The resulting lithium battery achieved an ultra-high energy density of 700 watt-hours per kilogram at room temperature and maintained nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram at minus 50 degrees centigrade, the research showed.</p><p>For comparison, commercial lithium batteries generally offer energy densities between 100 watt-hours per kilogram and 300 watt-hours per kilogram. The 4680 battery developed by electric vehicle maker Tesla, for instance, has an energy density close to 300 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>High-energy-density batteries based on the new electrolyte have broad application potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots, the low-altitude economy, and aerospace, said Chen Jun, associate president of Nankai University, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Guangdong topped the list with 86.5 million visits, followed closely by eastern Jiangsu province with 75.8 million, central Henan province with 62.8 million, northern Hubei province with 60.08 million, southwestern Sichuan province with 58.6 million and central Hunan province with 58.4 million visits.</p><p>In terms of tourism revenue, Guangdong, southeastern Zhejiang province and Jiangsu took the top three places, bringing in CNY84.8 billion (USD12.4 billion), CNY67.9 billion and CNY60.9 billion, respectively.</p><p>Compared to last year, southern provinces were back in the lead in terms of visitor and revenue growth. Southern China is normally a popular holiday destination during the winter months and the Chinese New Year holiday. But last year, northern attractions such as winter sports and ancient architecture tours in Shanxi province were hugely popular. That year, the growth rates of both visitor numbers and tourism revenue in northern provinces outpaced those in southern ones.</p><p>The four provinces with the fastest growth in tourism numbers over the nine-day break all saw increases of more than 20 percent.

            "description": "<div data-cover=\"https://img.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/02/112729262080709.jpg\" id=\"news-body\"><p>(Yicai) Feb. 26 -- Shares of several listed Chinese firms with lithium mining operations in Zimbabwe fell after Africa's top lithium producer abruptly halted all exports of the metal’s ore and concentrate a year earlier than planned, though the miners said the development would have limited impact on their businesses.</p><p>A spokesperson for Yahua Industrial Group told reporters today that the Sichuan province-based miner has already shipped out its lithium concentrate from Zimbabwe, and so it does not expect the Zimbabwean government’s sudden export halt to affect near-term production. Yahua’s shares [SHE: 002497] sank 8.8 percent to close at CNY26.44 (USD3.86) each in Shenzhen.</p><p>Zimbabwe’s mines ministry said yesterday that only entities with valid mining titles and approved processing plants will be authorized to export minerals. Agents and third-party traders will not be permitted to export on behalf of title holders, and applicants must include a provincial mining office recommendation letter certifying processing capacity, regulatory compliance, and the mineral composition of the consignment, it added.</p><p>Yahua’s spokesperson noted that traders and agents without local mining licences or processing qualifications are now ineligible to make exports, but stressed that the company can still apply for export permits if it provides supplementary documentation, something the firm has already begun to address.</p><p>All Chinese exports of lithium concentrate from Zimbabwe are on hold pending policy clarification, a spokesperson for Sinomine Resource Group said, adding that the Beijing-headquartered miner has virtually no locally processed lithium products in Zimbabwe and is considering options to extend its supply chain. No plans were ready for disclosure, the person said.</p><p>Sinomine’s stock [SHE: 002738] ended the day 4.8 percent lower at CNY87.59.</p><p>Zimbabwe’s lithium exports \"ban\" is essentially aimed at curbing unauthorised exports, a spokesperson for Huayou Cobalt told the media. The Zhejiang province-based firm’s license was issued by the mines ministry, and the full extent of any impact is still being assessed, the person said. Huayou Cobalt [SHA: 603799] fell 0.8 percent to finish at CNY76.88 in Shanghai.</p><p>Chinese miners have made substantial investments in Zimbabwe’s lithium sector. Bikita, fully owned by Sinomine, is one of Africa’s largest operational lithium mines, with an annual production capacity of about 600,000 tons of concentrate.</p><p>Chengxin Lithium Group has a majority stake in the Sabi Star mine, which produces roughly 300,000 tons of concentrate a year. Huayou Cobalt controls the Arcadia project, an integrated mining-and-processing operation that includes a 50,000-ton-per-year lithium sulfate facility. Yahua, meanwhile, has an interest in the Kamativi mine, which can produce 350,000 tons of concentrate annually.</p><p>Chengxin’s stock [SHE: 002240] gave up 6.5 percent to end at CNY42.26, while Zijin Mining Group [SHA: 601899] -- one of China’s biggest miners -- lost 0.7 percent, closing at CNY39.37.</p><p>The export halt is intended to force leading miners to build local processing plants and create more value domestically, Citic Securities said in a research note. Until new lithium-salt smelting capacity comes online, the brokerage said, the government may still allow limited export windows for large, compliant miners while excluding unlicensed traders and artisanal miners, which will raise export thresholds, boost the industry’s concentration, and benefit Chinese miners already in Zimbabwe.</p><p>Before the ban is lifted, China’s short-term supply of lithium carbonate is likely to tighten and lithium prices could surge, Citic Securities noted. </p><p>A number of Chinese lithium miners without exposure to Zimbabwe rallied. Jinyuan EP [SHE: 000546] surged by its 10 percent daily trading limit to CNY6.83 (USD1), Jiangxi Special Electric Motor [SHE: 002176] added 1.9 percent to CNY10.68, Yongshan Lithium [SHA: 603399] rose 0.9 percent to CNY11.82, [SHE: 001203] and Youngy [SHE: 002192] climbed 3.8 percent to CNY41.34 and CNY58.38, respectively. Yongxing Special Materials Technology [SHE: 002756] gained 3.5 percent to CNY59.</p><p>In recent years, countries rich in lithium, cobalt, nickel, tin, and other strategic minerals have tightened their control, Citic Securities noted, pointing to tin-mining restrictions in Myanmar, cobalt export curbs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and sharp reductions in nickel-ore quotas in Indonesia.</p><p>Amid a broader wave of resource nationalism and intensifying competition between the United States and China over control of critical minerals, further abrupt policy shifts by producer nations are likely, raising the risk of renewed supply disruptions, the brokerage said.</p><p>China imported about 7.75 million tons of lithium concentrate last year, up more than 39 percent from the previous year, mainly from Australia, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria, according to customs data.</p><p>Editor: Martin Kadiev</p></div>",

Yet astronomers face a major challenge. Weak signals from remote celestial objects are often obscured by background sky noise and thermal radiation from telescopes.<br/><br/>The study shows that applying the model's \"self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising\" technique to data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extends observational coverage from visible light at around 500 nanometers to the mid-infrared at 5 micrometers. It also increases the detection depth by 1.0 magnitude, effectively enabling the telescope to detect objects 2.5 times fainter than previously possible.<br/><br/>Using the model, the team identified more than 160 candidate high-redshift galaxies from the \"Cosmic Dawn\" period, roughly 200 million to 500 million years after the Big Bang, tripling the number of discoveries using previous methods, according to Cai Zheng, associate professor at Tsinghua's Department of Astronomy and a member of the research team.<br/><br/>Researchers said the AI model can decode massive volumes of space telescope data and is compatible with multiple observational platforms, giving it the potential to become a universal deep-space data enhancement platform.<br/><br/>Traditional noise-reduction techniques rely on stacking multiple exposures and assume noise is uniform or correlated. In reality, deep-space noise varies across both time and space. ASTERIS addresses this by reconstructing deep-space images as a 3D spatiotemporal volume.<br/><br/>Through \"photometric adaptive screening mechanism,\" the model identifies subtle noise fluctuations and distinguishes them from the ultra-faint signals of distant stars and galaxies.<br/><br/>\"Overall, I think this is a very relevant piece of work that can have an important impact across astronomy,\" one reviewer of the research said.<br/><br/>Faint celestial objects obscured by light noise in astronomical observations can be reconstructed with high fidelity, said Dai Qionghai, professor at Tsinghua's Department of Automation.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, researchers expect the technology to be deployed on next-generation telescopes to help address major scientific questions concerning decoding dark energy, dark matter, cosmic origins and exoplanets.</p></div>",

Leapmotor Technology has set an ambitious goal of hitting one million vehicles in 2026, equivalent to a 67.5 percent year-on-year increase. Xpeng is aiming for annual sales of 550,000 to 600,000 units, which translates to a growth rate of over 28 percent while Xiaomi Auto is targeting 550,000 vehicles, a jump of 34 percent. Nio has also said it plans to maintain stable annual growth of between 40 percent and 50 percent.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, though, has given a far more conservative forecast, projecting that vehicle sales this year will edge up 1 percent from the year before to 34.7 million units.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">On one side, automakers have ambitious growth targets, while on the other side, institutions are providing more cautious projections. This wide gap has set the tone for China’s auto market at the start of the year.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">In its 10th anniversary letter to employees, Leapmotor stated that this year the Hangzhou-based company aims to shift from simply \"exporting cars\" to \"manufacturing cars overseas,\" and will integrate more deeply with local industries.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">\"The industry’s elimination round is getting more brutal and competition will only become more fierce,\" said Zhao Fei, president of Changan Auto. “The window of opportunity in overseas markets is only one to two years. We must ramp up resource investment, push forward with all our efforts, and firmly promote our overseas doubling strategy.”</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">Xpeng plans to double overseas sales this year and sell one million units abroad by 2030, with overseas markets contributing more than 70 percent of the company's profits, Chairman He Xiaopeng said. The Guangzhou-based firm will focus on five key markets, namely Israel, Germany, Norway, Thailand and France.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">Geely will fully promote product adaptability and localized development, said Chief Executive Officer Gan Jiayue. The Hangzhou-based firm aims to build strong local competitiveness in key markets through product exports, brand expansion, resource integration, and technological empowerment.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">AI has become a core performance indicator for many auto manufacturers this year. For example, He said that this year Xpeng aims to be the world's first technology company to mass produce three cutting-edge AI businesses, namely robots, flying cars and Robotaxis, in the same year.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">Li Xiang, CEO of Li Auto, predicted in a company-wide meeting that Level 4 autonomous driving will be commercially deployed by 2028 at the latest. He also said that globally, there will be no more than three companies that effectively integrate foundational models, chips, embodied intelligence and operating systems. He made it clear that Beijing-based Li Auto will build humanoid robots and aims to unveil them as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">In January, Chery also rolled out its AI strategy, showcasing core AI achievements including its super AI assistant “Xiaoqi,\" the Falcon smart driving system, the Lingxi smart cockpit and the AiMOGA robot.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">German consulting firm Roland Berger predicts that top-tier industry concentration in the Chinese market will become even more pronounced this year. The market landscape is likely to consist of a handful of leading automakers, several mid-tier players and a large number of struggling smaller firms. In essence, the open letters from leading carmakers all send the same message that they are going all out to make sure they remain at the head of the pack.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(71,64,79);\">Editor: Kim Taylor</span></p></div>",

Certain entities holding shares to administer Shenji's stock incentive plan will hold the remaining 10 percent.</p><p>This financing round will help Shenji continue developing and promoting high-end and highly competitive chips, thus supporting Nio's long-term layout in the autonomous driving and embodied intelligence sectors, the Shanghai-based parent firm noted.</p><p>Last June, Nio spun off its in-house chip business and established Shenji. In November, Shenji teamed up with Axera Semiconductor and OmniVision Integrated Circuits Group to set up a joint venture with a registered capital of CNY100 million (USD14.6 million).</p><p>Shenji is the first company in China to have developed five-nanometer automotive-grade chips and achieved large-scale commercialization. In 2024, it launched the Shenji NX9031 chip, which has an actual computing power of about four times that of Nvidia's Orin-X, with a memory bandwidth of 546 gigabytes per second, about twice that of Nvidia's Thor-U, according to data from Nio.</p><p>More than 150,000 NX9031 chips have been equipped on Nio-branded cars, including the ET9, ES6, ES8, and EC6, since their release.</p><p>The research and development cost of the NX9031 was CNY2.3 billion to CNY3 billion, the same as that to build about 1,500 battery swap stations, according to Nio's Chief Executive Officer William Li.</p><p>NX9031 chips bring about CNY10,000 (USD1,450) in cost optimization per vehicle, which is almost five times that of Nvidia's Orin-X, Li noted, adding that the chip's cost advantage over domestic ones may not be as big.</p><p>Li mentioned several times that Shenji plans to sell and license the NX9031 to external companies. At the beginning of the year, he said in an internal letter that he was proud that Nio had the best chips.</p><p>Nio's target for 2026 is to achieve full-year non-GAAP profitability, Li said at an all-hands meeting held before the Chinese New Year holiday. Analysts believe that using Shenji to attract external capital and share R&amp;D costs may be a key part of Nio's strategy to achieve such goal.</p><p>Editor: Futura Costaglione</p></div>",

The drop has also widened substantially from the 1.1 percent slide logged the previous year.</p><p>BYD’s plug-in hybrid sales slumped 8 percent to 2.3 million units, bringing its overall NEV deliveries in 2025 to 4.6 million units, a year-on-year jump of 8 percent, it added.</p><p>BYD, which started out in 1995 as a manufacturer of lithium batteries, has grown into one of China’s leading makers of electric cars and power batteries. The company stopped producing gasoline-powered autos altogether in 2022 and that same year, its NEV sales surpassed Tesla’s for the first time, earning the top spot globally. In 2024, BYD overtook SAIC Motor to become China’s biggest automaker by sales.</p><p>Rapid expansion overseas has been a key driver of BYD’s growth. In 2025, its sales of passenger cars and pickups abroad surged 145 percent from the year before to one million units, according to company data. The firm’s global footprint has expanded to 110 countries and regions.</p><p>In response to growing uncertainty in international trade, BYD is accelerating the localization of production abroad.

Moving beyond the somewhat stiff dance routines of 2025, its new robots took center stage in a martial arts spectacle, wielding swords and nunchucks alongside human masters from a renowned kung-fu school.</p><p>These robots executed complex maneuvers like drunken boxing, backward obstacle avoidance and backflips, underscoring a leap from demonstrating basic mobility to mastering intricate, culturally rich physical artistry.</p><p>The 2026 gala stunts, supported by AI algorithms and 3D LiDAR, included multiple world firsts: a continuous parkour-style table vaulting sequence, catapulted aerial flips reaching a maximum height exceeding 3 meters, single-leg consecutive aerial flips followed by a two-step wall-run into a backflip, airflare rotation at 7.5 revolutions, and clustered rapid repositioning achieving arbitrary movement speeds of up to 4 meters per second, according to Unitree Robotics.</p><p>\"Unitree should get a robot Olympics going. It would be entertaining, and draw a lot of good attention to how capable humanoid robots are getting,\" Owen Lewis, a science enthusiast, commented on social media platform X in response to the show.</p><p>Another Chinese robotics startup MagicLab, seizing the coveted opening act, set the tone with its human-like machines performing a groundbreaking \"Thomas 360 degree.\" Later, six units synchronized seamlessly with pop stars for a musical number.</p><p>While others showcased physical prowess, Beijing-based Galbot demonstrated its aptitude for performing everyday tasks, from delicately cracking walnuts, picking up glass shards and retrieving items from shelves to folding clothes and skewering sausages for grilling.</p><p>The Galbot robot handled each task with dexterous, natural human-like movements. This capacity for autonomous decision-making and hand-eye coordination signaled that Chinese-designed robotics is moving beyond mere showmanship, instead pointing and shifting toward vast practical applications.</p><p>The most poignant moment of the gala was delivered by Noetix Robotics. Its robots starred in a comedy skit, a throwback to one 30 years ago, when an actress played a whimsical, clumsy robot. This time, she performed alongside authentic humanoids, including a stunningly accurate bionic replica of herself, created in just 30 days.</p><p>The show's classic comedy-of-errors narrative probed a deeper question amid the AI technology wave: human-robot relations. It ultimately affirmed the irreplaceable value of human warmth and connection, suggesting that advanced robotics, rather than replacing humanity, should enhance and reflect our own qualities.</p><p>Noetix's robot, notably, finished second in last year's robot half-marathon in China's capital, following Tien Kung from Beijing.</p><p>This robotics invasion of the gala marks a pivotal cultural and commercial moment. For decades, the event's advertising chronicled China's economic shifts, from bicycles and liquor to home appliances and internet services.</p><p>Now, robots and AI have made inroads into this prime symbolic space, representing the new engine of \"new quality productive forces.\" The performances translated technical jargon like \"embodied AI\" into a visceral, national experience.</p><p>More Chinese robotics firms also took to regional gala stages this year, including the likes of AgiBot, UniX AI and EngineAI, making technology an inescapable part of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide.</p><p>Last week, AgiBot also staged a global live gala, showcasing a diverse lineup ranging from synchronized dances and comedic skits to magic acts and traditional martial arts.</p><p>A recent industry report revealed that Chinese robotics firms had emerged as the largest producers of humanoid robots worldwide in 2025. AgiBot achieved an annual shipment volume of over 5,100 units, securing a 39-percent share of the global humanoid robot market, followed by two more Chinese tech firms, namely Unitree and UBTECH.</p><p>The year 2026 marks a critical turning point for the robotics industry, with it moving from simply \"handling many tasks with limited proficiency\" to truly \"accomplishing tasks with high performance and achieving practical application,\" said Luo Jianlan, chief scientist at AgiBot.</p><p>China has a clear national strategy in its quest to become a global robotics powerhouse, and the country has drawn attention and admiration from abroad thanks to its robust industrial ecosystems, fast iteration cycles and large-scale deployment capacity, said Dominic Gorecky, co-founder and director of Swiss Smart Factory.</p></div>",

The country slipped into recession in 2024, with growth forecast at around 0.2 percent last year and expected to recover to only about 1 percent this year, while uncertainty over US trade policy and potential tariff barriers has weighed heavily on German exports, particularly to the US.</p><p>Zheng Chunrong, director of the German Studies Center at Tongji University, told Yicai that the background of Merz’s visit is “rather complex,” noting that voices advocating “de-risking” from China remain influential in Germany’s political discourse.</p><p>Citing Merz, Zheng said that in an era of great power politics, over-reliance on a single major power risks losing strategic flexibility and even being “blackmailed,” making diversification of partnerships an inevitable choice. As China is Germany’s largest trading partner, there is an objective need for cooperation, Zheng added.</p><p>The Chinese scholar pointed out that Merz has made clear that “de-risking” does not equal “decoupling,” and that Germany should continue to seek cooperation in areas aligned with its interests, a stance echoed by several European leaders.</p><p>Business Focus and Industrial Cooperation</p><p>According to Zheng, Merz’s visit carries a dual mission. On the one hand, he is expected to convey the core demands of the German business community to the Chinese side. On the other hand, he plans to visit representative German companies operating in China, including Mercedes-Benz and Siemens, to gain a more intuitive understanding of their operations, cooperation models, profitability, and experience in China’s high-tech sectors, forming a more comprehensive and objective assessment of bilateral economic and trade ties.</p><p>Zheng noted that German investment patterns in China have evolved in recent years. More companies have shifted from exporting products from Germany to relocating production lines and even entire industrial chains to China. Cooperation has moved from one-way technology transfer to two-way integration and joint development, particularly in intelligent vehicles, where the two sides have carried out in-depth joint research and development.</p><p>Merz also plans to visit Chinese high-tech firms such as Unitree Robotics. In these emerging industries, China has taken a global lead in technology and standards and faces fewer constraints from entrenched traditional industry interests, Zheng said, adding that this creates broader scope for mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

These include warehouse modernization, fulfillment process optimization, and the development of the Shein Center of Innovation for Garment Manufacturing (CIGM) to improve production efficiency and consistency, according to the Singapore-headquartered firm's recent press release.</p><p>A central measure has been the adoption of management systems aligned with the standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In 2025, six Shein-operated logistics parks in China obtained ISO 14001 (involving environmental management systems) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management systems) certifications following audits by Swiss testing company SGS. The certifications confirm that the facilities have established internationally recognized systems supporting regular risk assessments, operational reviews, emergency preparedness, and employee training, with ongoing audits to ensure continuous improvement.</p><p>Shein has also expanded waste and resource management programs. In 2025, eight additional Shein-managed facilities received Zero Waste to Landfill Management System certification from TÜV Rheinland, bringing the total to 15 -- including the CIGM -- while seven previously certified facilities renewed their credentials. The certification assesses waste management procedures and outcomes. Following the latest approvals, all self-operated warehouses in China and nearly half of the company’s managed facilities in the country meet the standard. Shein is also exploring source reduction measures in warehouse operations, including packaging optimization.</p><p>At its fulfillment centers, the company has implemented measures to reduce single-use consumables, such as introducing reusable burlap bags, narrowing adhesive tape width, modifying carton thickness, adopting reusable straps and pallets, and reducing packaging bags per order. These steps have reduced or avoided about 932 metric tons of waste while maintaining operational safety and product protection.</p><p>In addition, Shein is advancing its Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) commitments under its water stewardship framework. In 2024, the company released a water stewardship policy to guide water management across its facilities and value chain partners. In 2025, WASH assessments using the United Nations-supported WASH4Work framework were completed at 28 self-operated warehouses and the CIGM, expanding coverage to 29 global sites. The results confirmed that all Shein-operated facilities meet WASH4Work standards.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Leapmotor, which sold the most EVs among NEV startups in China last year, slipped to third position, with deliveries up 27 percent to 32,059 units in the period.</p><p>In fact, Xiaomi Auto also overtook Leapmotor last month, having delivered over 39,000 electric vehicles.</p><p>Shanghai-based Nio saw its deliveries nearly double to 27,182 units in January from a year earlier, driven by strong sales of its new ES8, which was released in the second half of last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, both Li Auto and Xpeng Motors experienced declines in deliveries in the period, with the former down 8 percent to 27,668 units, and the latter down 34 percent to 20,011 units.</p><p>On a monthly basis, sales of NEV startups generally declined in January.

Sales of Li Auto plunged 37 percent, and those of Aito and Xiaomi Auto shrank 31 percent and 22 percent, respectively.</p><p>Due to the tendency of Chinese carmakers to engage in aggressive promotional activities at the end of the year to boost sales and achieve their annual delivery targets, the market typically experiences a cooling adjustment in January.</p><p>Moreover, China has abolished the 12-year policy of exempting NEVs from purchase taxes from Jan. 1, replacing it with a 5 percent tax based on the vehicle's selling price, which has led to an increase in consumers' purchasing costs this month.</p><p>China's retail sales of passenger cars totaled 679,000 units between Jan. 1 and 18, down 28 percent from a year earlier and 37 percent from a month earlier, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.

This compares with an adjusted operating loss of CNY5.5 billion (USD792.5 million) in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company is expected to have recorded an operating profit of about USD29 million to USD100 million for the quarter, it added.</p><p>Founded in 2014, Nio has long been criticized for persistent losses. The company’s net loss widened 8 percent year on year to CNY22.4 billion (USD3.2 billion) in 2024. In the first three quarters of last year, net losses reached CNY15.7 billion, up 1 percent from a year earlier.</p><p>Against this backdrop, founder and Chief Executive Officer Li Bin said at an internal meeting in October last year that Nio must achieve profitability by the fourth quarter of 2025, warning that failure to do so would pose serious challenges to the company’s long-term development.</p><p>The expected profit in the quarter ended in December 2025 was mainly driven by sustained growth in fourth-quarter sales volume, improved vehicle margins from a favorable product mix, and the company’s ongoing cost-cutting measures and efficiency improvements, according to the announcement.</p><p>Nio launched the third-generation ES8, a large all-electric sport utility vehicle, in September last year and delivered 40,000 units within 100 days. Supported by the strong performance of this model, fourth-quarter deliveries jumped 72 percent year on year to almost 124,810 vehicles, setting a new quarterly record.</p><p>In January this year, Nio delivered more than 27,180 vehicles, up 96 percent from a year earlier but down 44 percent from December, according to the latest data.</p><p>Editors: Dou Shicong, Emmi Laine</p></div>",
