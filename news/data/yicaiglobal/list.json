The Ministry of Public Security also released draft auto safety standards last month, which among other things propose that passenger cars should not be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under 5 seconds.</p><p>These rules not only steer innovation in the right direction, but also deliver much-needed protection for consumers in a rapidly changing market, Cisek pointed out. For example, the proposal  to limit acceleration reflects concern about unnecessary performance competition, a stance that aligns well with Volkswagen’s long-standing emphasis on driving safety, he said.</p><p>In response to fierce competition in China’s auto market, Volkswagen is speeding up its strategic transformation. Part of that involves partnering with domestic EV startup Xpeng Motors to jointly develop the China Electrical Architecture, a platform for the electronic and electrical systems in its Chinese cars.</p><p>From next year Volkswagen's three joint ventures in the country will share electrification development platforms, including the CEA. At the same time, Volkswagen Group China Technology based in Hefei, Anhui province will serve as the research and development center responsible for coordinating these efforts, Cisek noted.</p><p>This will help avoid redundant investment while allowing the JVs to tailor products for their specific target users, thereby maximizing synergy, he explained. The JVs are FAW Volkswagen with FAW Group, SAIC Volkswagen with SAIC Motor, and Volkswagen Anhui with JAC Motors.</p><p>Editors: Dou Shicong, Futura Costaglione</p></div>",

In addition, global sales fell 10 percent to about 279,000 units, the biggest drop since 2009.</p><p>Previously, Porsche China Chief Executive Pan Liqi confirmed the company's plans to reduce the number of authorized sales outlets in the country from 150 in 2024 to 120 by the end of last year and to about 80 by the end of this year.</p><p>Porsche failed to reach the delivery level of 2024 after years of record growth, which was in line with its internal expectations, mainly because supply shortage for the 718 model and the Macan fuel version, Matthias Becker, member of the executive board for sales and marketing, said on Jan. 16. Its strategy of prioritizing per-vehicle profit over simply pursuing sales also had a certain impact, he added.</p><p>With the rapid development of Chinese new energy vehicles, the structure of the local auto market has changed, with some high-end domestic cars diverting the traditional luxury market. In addition, luxury brands have been slow in their electric transition.</p><p>Porsche was the first ultra-luxury brand to launch a battery electric vehicle, releasing the electric version of the Taycan in 2019. However, it did not develop any exclusive models for the Chinese market.</p><p>Last September, Porsche announced it would slow down its electrification process, postponing the launch of some BEV models while planning to roll out more fuel cars and plug-in hybrid EVs.</p><p>Porsche sells the Taycan and the Macan BEVs in China, but their performance has not met expectations. It plans to bring the electric editions of the Cayenne and 718 to the Chinese market this year.</p><p>Porsche China will gradually cease operations of about 200 self-built premium charging stations across the country from March 1, terminating related services and removing them from the charging map in the Porsche App and WeChat mini-program, it said at the end of last year. The move is likely due to the shift in the company's electrification strategy.</p><p>Editor: Martin Kadiev</p></div>",

However, mainstream non-volatile memory, such as NAND flash, previously required 5 volts or higher to complete write operations.</p><p>This mismatch lead to the integration of complex circuits for voltage step-up or step-down to enable collaboration between logic and memory units. Such integration resulted in additional power consumption, wasted space, and data transfer bottlenecks between logic and memory.</p><p>In typical AI chips, 60 to 90 percent of total power consumption is used for data transfer rather than computation. This has become one of the core constraints limiting improvements in AI computing power and energy efficiency.</p><p>The team from Peking University led by Qiu Chenguang, a senior researcher, and Peng Lianmao, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has developed nano-gate ferroelectric transistors with an ultralow operation voltage of 0.6 volts, successfully shrinking the physical size of the gate to 1 nanometer.</p><p>Reviewers of Science Advances note that these nano-gate ferroelectric transistor devices exhibit excellent memory performance, for the first time achieving voltage compatibility between ferroelectric memory devices and logic transistors. The physical mechanism behind this technology holds significant implications for the development of the memory sector.</p><p>Qiu said their findings resolve the challenge of voltage incompatibility between memory and logic. Data can now be transferred between memory and computing units at the same low voltage with zero barriers and ultra-low power consumption for high-speed interaction.</p><p>He added that the principle underlying this technology is universal and can be applied to mainstream ferroelectric materials. It can also be mass-produced using standard industrial processes, demonstrating strong industrial compatibility.</p><p>Notably, this technology is expected to be used in large model inference, edge intelligence, wearable devices, and Internet of Things terminals in the future.</p><p>Editor: Dou Shicong</p></div>",

            "description": "<div data-cover=\"https://img.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/02/112020362526405.jpg\" id=\"news-body\"><p>(Yicai) Feb.18 -- At 10 a.m. sharp, two 1.3-meter-tall humanoid robots in a storefront in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province, sprang to life, twisting and turning in perfect sync to a rhythmic beat. The conclusion of their dance coincided with the country's first-ever 7S humanoid robot store officially opening for its daily business.</p><p>Much like the automotive 4S shops, this novel concept aims to be a one-stop hub. But instead of cars, it focuses on humanoid robots. The 7S model builds on the traditional automobile 4S concept, namely sales, service, spare parts and surveys, by adding solution, show and school functions, thereby covering the entire industrial chain from components and whole machines to scenario-based applications.</p><p>Since opening in November 2025, this store in Wuhan, run by Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, has become a landmark of a shopping mall in the Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, also known as the Optics Valley of China, a tech hub in Hubei.</p><p>China's humanoid robot industry saw significant growth throughout 2025, backed by national and local government mid-to-long-term plans targeting it as a strategic sector. The 7S store represents a pioneering step in exploring viable commercial models and market acceptance for this transformative technology.</p><p>\"In nearly two months, we've received approximately 18,000 visits, becoming a popular tech destination in Wuhan for both locals and tourists,\" said store manager Hu Longdan.</p><p>\"Cumulative revenue has reached almost CNY615,000 (about USD88,600). Humanoid robots are very popular for rentals, having served 10 plus commercial events, while experience projects featuring robot dogs and robot soccer have become major attractions for the youth,\" Hu noted.</p><p>Inside the bustling store, robots of various sizes and shapes demonstrate their capabilities: some play soccer, others serve as retail assistants, while another group plays musical instruments.</p><p>\"We have 17 different models of humanoid robots here, priced from CNY149 to CNY700,000. They can be deployed in over 10 scenarios including industrial manufacturing, cultural tourism guidance, elderly care and special operations,\" said Hu.</p><p>China has intensified its efforts to foster future industries like embodied AI, as outlined in the proposals for the formulation of the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030). The goal is to cultivate new economic growth engines through technological innovation and market exploration.</p><p>The 7S store in Wuhan is part of a national wave of robot-themed retail experiments to promote real-life application of humanoid robots, a key phase for the development of the industry. A think tank report forecasts that by 2045, China will have over 100 million humanoid robots deployed across industries, creating a total market value of approximately CNY10 trillion.</p><p>In July last year, a robot 6S store, said to be the world's first, opened in Shenzhen, a tech hub in south China. A month later, Beijing's Robot Mall, a 4,000-square-meter robot 4S showroom, debuted during a robot consumption festival, featuring more than 50 products spanning medical, industrial and companion robotics.</p><p>The Wuhan store, notably, features a schooling function, addressing the \"last mile\" of skill development, thus standing out when compared to its peers.</p><p>This means the Wuhan store is not just a sales venue but also a \"hands-on experience center\" offering interactive engagement and skills enhancement. Staff members highlight that the store provides robotics operator training, maintenance technician certification and introductory courses for teenagers.</p><p>In addition, corporate engineers can acquire practical skills in operating and maintaining humanoid robots on-site, while middle school students can learn programming and logic through hands-on activities.</p><p>\"We've held 20 sessions, including eight instances of operator training, 12 youth courses and two teacher training events, involving over 1,000 participants,\" said Hu.</p><p>About 65 percent of the trainees are youths, primarily students building foundational skills. Professionals, like engineers and teachers, accounting for 35 percent, seek operational and maintenance expertise. Over 50 professionals, meanwhile, have gained basic robot operation skills via the store programs, Hu revealed.</p><p>The store exemplifies the region's integrated supply chain.</p><p>A key attraction near the store entrance is Yuan You, meaning Far Traveler in English, which is a wheel-footed robot standing 158 cm tall and weighing 72 kg.</p><p>\"It can walk 1.5 meters per second,\" Hu said. \"It's a Hubei native and has been 'working' for nine months at a hospital in the city of Xianning in Hubei, providing guidance, explanations and even moxibustion therapy services.\"</p><p>Yuan Chao, general manager of Wuhan HandX Innovation Technology Co., Ltd, developer of Yuan You, noted that a team from the prestigious Wuhan University had provided both solutions for sensors and AI technology for this robot, while Hubei's local industrial chain supplied over 80 percent of the hardware.</p><p>\"Hubei has roughly 20 core humanoid robot supply chain enterprises and nearly a thousand related firms, allowing us to procure key components like the 'brain,' 'skeleton' and 'electronic skin,'\" Yuan added.</p><p>The first Yuan You was born in April 2025 after just six months of R&amp;D and is now in mass production, with four automated lines capable of producing 1,500 units annually.</p><p>Ensuring these robots are not just produced, but are also capable of performing effectively, is crucial. In June 2025, Hubei established a school for humanoids, known as the Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center. There, newly-born robots are trained by data collectors.</p><p>\"We provide 23 high-fidelity simulation scenarios and over 10 temporary ones, capable of training hundreds of robots simultaneously, collecting more than a million real-machine data points annually,\" said Liu Chuanhou, chief operating officer of the center.</p><p>\"This data, after review, labeling and cleaning, is used for large-model training, enabling continuous robot evolution,\" Liu explained.</p><p>To propel robots from training to real-world value creation, Wuhan has released a three-year action plan and supportive policies, encouraging the development of diverse application scenarios.</p><p>Dong Danhong, director of the Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau, noted that the focus is on unlocking scenarios in hazardous/special operations, manufacturing activities like in the automotive sector, and public services such as elderly care and education.</p><p>Positioning the store as a national window for humanoid robotics, Hu said the 7S store is aiming to secure more than 100,000 visits in 2026, while hosting over 50 training sessions for more than 3,000 participants, thereby nurturing both youth interest and professional talent.</p><p>\"What humanoid robots can do today is still limited, but in the future, they will surely enter millions of households and serve numerous industries, becoming important members of our lives,\" Hu concluded.</p></div>",

Shanghai-based Nio will retain a controlling interest of 62.7 percent, while the remaining 10 percent will stay with the unit’s employee stock incentive program.</p><p>The new funding will help Shenji go on developing and promoting high-end and highly competitive chips, thereby supporting Nio's long-term strategy in the autonomous driving and embodied intelligence sectors, its parent firm noted.</p><p>Last June, Nio spun off its chip business to establish Shenji. In November, the unit teamed up with Axera Semiconductor and OmniVision Integrated Circuits Group to form a joint venture with a registered capital of CNY100 million (USD14.6 million).</p><p>Shenji is the first company in China to have developed five-nanometer automotive-grade chips and achieved large-scale commercialization. In 2024, it launched the Shenji NX9031 chip, which has actual computing power about four times that of Nvidia's Orin-X, with a memory bandwidth of 546 gigabytes per second, which is about twice that of Nvidia's Thor-U, according to Nio’s data.</p><p>More than 150,000 NX9031 chips have been used in Nio-branded cars, including the ET9, ES6, ES8, and EC6, since their release.</p><p>Research and development of the NX9031 cost CNY2.3 billion to CNY3 billion, the same as building about 1,500 battery swap stations, according to Nio Chief Executive William Li. NX9031 chips offer a cost advantage of about CNY10,000 (USD1,450) per vehicle, which is almost five times that of Nvidia's Orin-X, Li said, adding that the cost advantage over domestic rivals may not be as big.</p><p>Li has mentioned several times that Shenji plans to sell and license the NX9031 to other companies. At the start of the year, he also said in a letter to staff that he was proud that Nio had the best chips.</p><p>Nio aims to achieve full-year profitability on the basis of non-generally accepted accounting principles in 2026, Li said at an all-hands meeting held before the Chinese New Year holiday. Analysts believe that using Shenji to attract outside funding and share R&amp;D costs may be a key part of Nio's strategy in reaching that goal.</p><p>Nio’s shares [HKG: 9866] closed 2.5 percent lower at HKG39.60 (USD5.06) each in Hong Kong today.

The newly designed electrolyte allows batteries to retain nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram even at minus 50 degrees centigrade, compared with the 100 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram typical of commercial batteries today.</p><p>The research, published in Nature yesterday, was conducted by scientists from the College of Chemistry at Nankai University and the Shanghai Institute of Space Power-Sources. The team designed a new fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecule and built an electrolyte system that replaces the conventional lithium-oxygen coordination mode found in mainstream electrolytes.</p><p>Electrolytes serve as the key medium for conducting charged ions between the positive and negative electrodes of lithium batteries. Current mainstream electrolytes consist of lithium salts and carbonate solvents and rely on interactions between lithium and oxygen atoms in the solvent to facilitate dissolution. However, poor wettability limits battery energy density, while restricted charge transfer capacity at low temperatures prevents operation below minus 50 degrees centigrade.</p><p>To overcome these constraints, the Nankai University team proposed replacing oxygen atoms with fluorine atoms to enhance the effective dissolution of lithium salts in the electrolyte. The resulting lithium battery achieved an ultra-high energy density of 700 watt-hours per kilogram at room temperature and maintained nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram at minus 50 degrees centigrade, the research showed.</p><p>For comparison, commercial lithium batteries generally offer energy densities between 100 watt-hours per kilogram and 300 watt-hours per kilogram. The 4680 battery developed by electric vehicle maker Tesla, for instance, has an energy density close to 300 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>High-energy-density batteries based on the new electrolyte have broad application potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots, the low-altitude economy, and aerospace, said Chen Jun, associate president of Nankai University, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Once the EU’s new customs data hub becomes operational, the interim levy will be replaced by standard customs tariffs.</p><p>The change signals the end of the “volume-driven era” for low-margin e-commerce exports, Zhu Qiuyuan, a law professor at Shanghai Customs College, told Yicai. The cost structure of Chinese cross-border e-commerce will face a complete reset, said Zhu, who is also vice president of the Customs Law Research Association of the Shanghai Law Society.</p><p>The EU imported 4.6 billion e-commerce parcels valued below EUR150 in 2024, with 91 percent originating from China, according to data from the European Parliament. Average daily volume reached 12 million parcels, nearly tripling from 2023 and more than tripling from 2022.</p><p>Under the EU’s plan, it will end the EUR150 customs duty exemption threshold from July 1, 2028, imposing unified tariffs and value-added taxes on all imported goods. It will also introduce a simplified “Duty Buckets” classification system, dividing products into five tax tiers of 0 percent, 5 percent, 8 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent to further standardize customs administration for cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>Zhu added that a customs handling fee for e-commerce parcels will take effect this November. The fee will be independent of the EUR3 levy, with specific standards and the final implementation date yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Beyond the EU, the United Kingdom announced in its autumn budget last year that it will end the GBP135 (USD182) customs duty relief, with the current exemption set to be withdrawn by March 2029 at the latest.</p><p>The moves by the EU and UK underscore a clear global trend toward reducing or scrapping low-value import tax exemptions, Zhu said, urging cross-border e-commerce firms and their logistics partners to closely monitor policy developments.</p><p>Zhu also suggested that small and mid-sized sellers use professional third-party service providers or jointly hire customs consultants in Europe to share costs and achieve compliance. At the same time, sellers should gradually strengthen their own compliance awareness and capabilities, he added. </p><p>As tax breaks for small parcels get phased out, timely adjustments to pricing, logistics, and product selection strategies, as well as a shift toward higher value-added and compliant operations, will be critical to maintaining a foothold in the European market, Zhu said.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Yet astronomers face a major challenge. Weak signals from remote celestial objects are often obscured by background sky noise and thermal radiation from telescopes.<br/><br/>The study shows that applying the model's \"self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising\" technique to data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extends observational coverage from visible light at around 500 nanometers to the mid-infrared at 5 micrometers. It also increases the detection depth by 1.0 magnitude, effectively enabling the telescope to detect objects 2.5 times fainter than previously possible.<br/><br/>Using the model, the team identified more than 160 candidate high-redshift galaxies from the \"Cosmic Dawn\" period, roughly 200 million to 500 million years after the Big Bang, tripling the number of discoveries using previous methods, according to Cai Zheng, associate professor at Tsinghua's Department of Astronomy and a member of the research team.<br/><br/>Researchers said the AI model can decode massive volumes of space telescope data and is compatible with multiple observational platforms, giving it the potential to become a universal deep-space data enhancement platform.<br/><br/>Traditional noise-reduction techniques rely on stacking multiple exposures and assume noise is uniform or correlated. In reality, deep-space noise varies across both time and space. ASTERIS addresses this by reconstructing deep-space images as a 3D spatiotemporal volume.<br/><br/>Through \"photometric adaptive screening mechanism,\" the model identifies subtle noise fluctuations and distinguishes them from the ultra-faint signals of distant stars and galaxies.<br/><br/>\"Overall, I think this is a very relevant piece of work that can have an important impact across astronomy,\" one reviewer of the research said.<br/><br/>Faint celestial objects obscured by light noise in astronomical observations can be reconstructed with high fidelity, said Dai Qionghai, professor at Tsinghua's Department of Automation.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, researchers expect the technology to be deployed on next-generation telescopes to help address major scientific questions concerning decoding dark energy, dark matter, cosmic origins and exoplanets.</p></div>",

Average monthly active customers surged 31 percent, and the company had more than 100 million for five consecutive months from June. Same-store sales growth at self-operated outlets recovered to 7.5 percent from minus 17 percent the year before.</p><p>Given the high comparative base resulting from generous subsidies from platforms last year, this year’s same-store sales and profit may face some near-term challenges and swings, Chairman and Chief Executive Guo Jinyi said.</p><p>“China's coffee industry is still in its early stages, with significant growth potential,” he said, adding that short-term bumps in the road will not alter the long-term growth trajectory.</p><p>The competitive landscape is changing, though, Guo said. Brands can no longer rely solely on price, a single hit product, or specific marketing campaigns. This year, Luckin plans to continue opening new stores at a \"competitive\" pace, and will shift its pricing approach to “maintaining competitive pricing while expanding the product price range.”</p><p>In the last quarter of 2025, as the fresh drinks market entered its low season and subsidies started to ease, Luckin’s net profit plunged 39 percent from a year earlier to CNY520 million (USD75.8 million). Revenue climbed 33 percent to CNY12.7 billion (USD1.8 billion).</p><p>Quarterly same-store sales and profit were affected by a combination of seasonal factors, changes in the subsidy strategies of delivery platforms, and adjustments in the product mix, all of which were expected, Guo pointed out.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

In terms of overall NEV shipments, which includes plug-in hybrids, BYD has now ranked first for four straight years.</p><p>BYD’s sales of pure electric cars soared 28 percent last year from the year before to 2.3 million vehicles, the Shenzhen-based automaker said on Jan. 2.</p><p>By contrast, Tesla’s shipments, which were reported on the same day, tumbled 8.6 percent to 1.6 million vehicles in the Austin-based firm’s second consecutive year of declines. The drop has also widened substantially from the 1.1 percent slide logged the previous year.</p><p>BYD’s plug-in hybrid sales slumped 8 percent to 2.3 million units, bringing its overall NEV deliveries in 2025 to 4.6 million units, a year-on-year jump of 8 percent, it added.</p><p>BYD, which started out in 1995 as a manufacturer of lithium batteries, has grown into one of China’s leading makers of electric cars and power batteries. The company stopped producing gasoline-powered autos altogether in 2022 and that same year, its NEV sales surpassed Tesla’s for the first time, earning the top spot globally. In 2024, BYD overtook SAIC Motor to become China’s biggest automaker by sales.</p><p>Rapid expansion overseas has been a key driver of BYD’s growth. In 2025, its sales of passenger cars and pickups abroad surged 145 percent from the year before to one million units, according to company data. The firm’s global footprint has expanded to 110 countries and regions.</p><p>In response to growing uncertainty in international trade, BYD is accelerating the localization of production abroad. Since 2024, the company has built plants in Thailand, Uzbekistan and Brazil. Its first European factory, located in Hungary, is set to be completed and to start production later this year.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

Leapmotor posted year-on-year sales growth of 103 percent last year, delivering 596,555 vehicles and surpassing its annual target of 500,000 units.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://imgcn.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/01/109395318521541.png\"/></figure><p>Among other electric vehicle startups, Xpeng is targeting sales of 550,000 to 600,000 units this year, implying growth of 28 percent to 40 percent from last year’s around 429,450 vehicles. Nio has set a sales growth target of 40 percent to 50 percent, after delivering almost 326,030 vehicles last year.</p><p>In its third year in the auto industry, tech giant Xiaomi aims to sell 550,000 vehicles this year. Xiaomi Auto recorded a three-fold jump in sales last year to nearly 411,840 units, entering the top 10 new energy vehicle manufacturers in China by sales volume for the first time.</p><p>Seres Group, which has partnered with Huawei Technologies to develop the premium electric vehicle brand Aito, is targeting sales of 500,000 units this year, representing growth of about 6 percent from last year.</p><p><strong>Ambitious Traditional Carmakers</strong></p><p>Among traditional automakers, Great Wall Motor has set the most ambitious target, aiming to boost sales by 36 percent to 1.8 million units.</p><p>Moreover, Changan Automobile and BAIC Group, which received the first batch of L3-level autonomous driving road permits from Chinese authorities at the end of last year, are targeting sales growth of 13 percent and 26 percent, respectively, to reach 3.3 million units and 2.2 million units.</p><p>Dongfeng Motor Group aims to increase sales by 31 percent to 3.3 million units this year, while Chery Automobile is targeting 14 percent growth to 3.2 million units. Geely Auto plans to lift sales by 8 percent to 3.5 million units, and FAW Group has set a growth target of 7 percent, also aiming for 3.5 million units.</p><p><strong>Cautious Analyst Outlook</strong></p><p>Despite automakers’ expansion ambitions, industry associations and research institutions have issued more cautious forecasts. China has ended a 12-year NEV purchase tax exemption and replaced it with a 5 percent tax rate, while subsidies for vehicle trade-ins have also been reduced from last year.</p><p>The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects total vehicle sales in China to rise 1 percent this year to 34.8 million units. Although this would mark the sixth consecutive year of growth since 2021, the increase would be the slowest in nearly six years.</p><p>Gong Min, head of China auto industry research at UBS Securities, said the Chinese auto market is likely to see low single-digit declines in wholesale sales and mid single-digit declines in retail sales. New energy vehicle sales, however, are expected to grow by 8 percent against the broader market trend.</p><p>Editors: Dou Shicong, Emmi Laine</p></div>",
