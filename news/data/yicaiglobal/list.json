In terms of overall NEV shipments, which includes plug-in hybrids, BYD has now ranked first for four straight years.</p><p>BYD’s sales of pure electric cars soared 28 percent last year from the year before to 2.3 million vehicles, the Shenzhen-based automaker said on Jan. 2.</p><p>By contrast, Tesla’s shipments, which were reported on the same day, tumbled 8.6 percent to 1.6 million vehicles in the Austin-based firm’s second consecutive year of declines. The drop has also widened substantially from the 1.1 percent slide logged the previous year.</p><p>BYD’s plug-in hybrid sales slumped 8 percent to 2.3 million units, bringing its overall NEV deliveries in 2025 to 4.6 million units, a year-on-year jump of 8 percent, it added.</p><p>BYD, which started out in 1995 as a manufacturer of lithium batteries, has grown into one of China’s leading makers of electric cars and power batteries. The company stopped producing gasoline-powered autos altogether in 2022 and that same year, its NEV sales surpassed Tesla’s for the first time, earning the top spot globally. In 2024, BYD overtook SAIC Motor to become China’s biggest automaker by sales.</p><p>Rapid expansion overseas has been a key driver of BYD’s growth. In 2025, its sales of passenger cars and pickups abroad surged 145 percent from the year before to one million units, according to company data. The firm’s global footprint has expanded to 110 countries and regions.</p><p>In response to growing uncertainty in international trade, BYD is accelerating the localization of production abroad. Since 2024, the company has built plants in Thailand, Uzbekistan and Brazil. Its first European factory, located in Hungary, is set to be completed and to start production later this year.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

Moving beyond the somewhat stiff dance routines of 2025, its new robots took center stage in a martial arts spectacle, wielding swords and nunchucks alongside human masters from a renowned kung-fu school.</p><p>These robots executed complex maneuvers like drunken boxing, backward obstacle avoidance and backflips, underscoring a leap from demonstrating basic mobility to mastering intricate, culturally rich physical artistry.</p><p>The 2026 gala stunts, supported by AI algorithms and 3D LiDAR, included multiple world firsts: a continuous parkour-style table vaulting sequence, catapulted aerial flips reaching a maximum height exceeding 3 meters, single-leg consecutive aerial flips followed by a two-step wall-run into a backflip, airflare rotation at 7.5 revolutions, and clustered rapid repositioning achieving arbitrary movement speeds of up to 4 meters per second, according to Unitree Robotics.</p><p>\"Unitree should get a robot Olympics going. It would be entertaining, and draw a lot of good attention to how capable humanoid robots are getting,\" Owen Lewis, a science enthusiast, commented on social media platform X in response to the show.</p><p>Another Chinese robotics startup MagicLab, seizing the coveted opening act, set the tone with its human-like machines performing a groundbreaking \"Thomas 360 degree.\" Later, six units synchronized seamlessly with pop stars for a musical number.</p><p>While others showcased physical prowess, Beijing-based Galbot demonstrated its aptitude for performing everyday tasks, from delicately cracking walnuts, picking up glass shards and retrieving items from shelves to folding clothes and skewering sausages for grilling.</p><p>The Galbot robot handled each task with dexterous, natural human-like movements. This capacity for autonomous decision-making and hand-eye coordination signaled that Chinese-designed robotics is moving beyond mere showmanship, instead pointing and shifting toward vast practical applications.</p><p>The most poignant moment of the gala was delivered by Noetix Robotics. Its robots starred in a comedy skit, a throwback to one 30 years ago, when an actress played a whimsical, clumsy robot. This time, she performed alongside authentic humanoids, including a stunningly accurate bionic replica of herself, created in just 30 days.</p><p>The show's classic comedy-of-errors narrative probed a deeper question amid the AI technology wave: human-robot relations. It ultimately affirmed the irreplaceable value of human warmth and connection, suggesting that advanced robotics, rather than replacing humanity, should enhance and reflect our own qualities.</p><p>Noetix's robot, notably, finished second in last year's robot half-marathon in China's capital, following Tien Kung from Beijing.</p><p>This robotics invasion of the gala marks a pivotal cultural and commercial moment. For decades, the event's advertising chronicled China's economic shifts, from bicycles and liquor to home appliances and internet services.</p><p>Now, robots and AI have made inroads into this prime symbolic space, representing the new engine of \"new quality productive forces.\" The performances translated technical jargon like \"embodied AI\" into a visceral, national experience.</p><p>More Chinese robotics firms also took to regional gala stages this year, including the likes of AgiBot, UniX AI and EngineAI, making technology an inescapable part of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide.</p><p>Last week, AgiBot also staged a global live gala, showcasing a diverse lineup ranging from synchronized dances and comedic skits to magic acts and traditional martial arts.</p><p>A recent industry report revealed that Chinese robotics firms had emerged as the largest producers of humanoid robots worldwide in 2025. AgiBot achieved an annual shipment volume of over 5,100 units, securing a 39-percent share of the global humanoid robot market, followed by two more Chinese tech firms, namely Unitree and UBTECH.</p><p>The year 2026 marks a critical turning point for the robotics industry, with it moving from simply \"handling many tasks with limited proficiency\" to truly \"accomplishing tasks with high performance and achieving practical application,\" said Luo Jianlan, chief scientist at AgiBot.</p><p>China has a clear national strategy in its quest to become a global robotics powerhouse, and the country has drawn attention and admiration from abroad thanks to its robust industrial ecosystems, fast iteration cycles and large-scale deployment capacity, said Dominic Gorecky, co-founder and director of Swiss Smart Factory.</p></div>",

The country slipped into recession in 2024, with growth forecast at around 0.2 percent last year and expected to recover to only about 1 percent this year, while uncertainty over US trade policy and potential tariff barriers has weighed heavily on German exports, particularly to the US.</p><p>Zheng Chunrong, director of the German Studies Center at Tongji University, told Yicai that the background of Merz’s visit is “rather complex,” noting that voices advocating “de-risking” from China remain influential in Germany’s political discourse.</p><p>Citing Merz, Zheng said that in an era of great power politics, over-reliance on a single major power risks losing strategic flexibility and even being “blackmailed,” making diversification of partnerships an inevitable choice. As China is Germany’s largest trading partner, there is an objective need for cooperation, Zheng added.</p><p>The Chinese scholar pointed out that Merz has made clear that “de-risking” does not equal “decoupling,” and that Germany should continue to seek cooperation in areas aligned with its interests, a stance echoed by several European leaders.</p><p>Business Focus and Industrial Cooperation</p><p>According to Zheng, Merz’s visit carries a dual mission. On the one hand, he is expected to convey the core demands of the German business community to the Chinese side. On the other hand, he plans to visit representative German companies operating in China, including Mercedes-Benz and Siemens, to gain a more intuitive understanding of their operations, cooperation models, profitability, and experience in China’s high-tech sectors, forming a more comprehensive and objective assessment of bilateral economic and trade ties.</p><p>Zheng noted that German investment patterns in China have evolved in recent years. More companies have shifted from exporting products from Germany to relocating production lines and even entire industrial chains to China. Cooperation has moved from one-way technology transfer to two-way integration and joint development, particularly in intelligent vehicles, where the two sides have carried out in-depth joint research and development.</p><p>Merz also plans to visit Chinese high-tech firms such as Unitree Robotics. In these emerging industries, China has taken a global lead in technology and standards and faces fewer constraints from entrenched traditional industry interests, Zheng said, adding that this creates broader scope for mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

These include warehouse modernization, fulfillment process optimization, and the development of the Shein Center of Innovation for Garment Manufacturing (CIGM) to improve production efficiency and consistency, according to the Singapore-headquartered firm's recent press release.</p><p>A central measure has been the adoption of management systems aligned with the standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In 2025, six Shein-operated logistics parks in China obtained ISO 14001 (involving environmental management systems) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management systems) certifications following audits by Swiss testing company SGS. The certifications confirm that the facilities have established internationally recognized systems supporting regular risk assessments, operational reviews, emergency preparedness, and employee training, with ongoing audits to ensure continuous improvement.</p><p>Shein has also expanded waste and resource management programs. In 2025, eight additional Shein-managed facilities received Zero Waste to Landfill Management System certification from TÜV Rheinland, bringing the total to 15 -- including the CIGM -- while seven previously certified facilities renewed their credentials. The certification assesses waste management procedures and outcomes. Following the latest approvals, all self-operated warehouses in China and nearly half of the company’s managed facilities in the country meet the standard. Shein is also exploring source reduction measures in warehouse operations, including packaging optimization.</p><p>At its fulfillment centers, the company has implemented measures to reduce single-use consumables, such as introducing reusable burlap bags, narrowing adhesive tape width, modifying carton thickness, adopting reusable straps and pallets, and reducing packaging bags per order. These steps have reduced or avoided about 932 metric tons of waste while maintaining operational safety and product protection.</p><p>In addition, Shein is advancing its Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) commitments under its water stewardship framework. In 2024, the company released a water stewardship policy to guide water management across its facilities and value chain partners. In 2025, WASH assessments using the United Nations-supported WASH4Work framework were completed at 28 self-operated warehouses and the CIGM, expanding coverage to 29 global sites. The results confirmed that all Shein-operated facilities meet WASH4Work standards.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

However, mainstream non-volatile memory, such as NAND flash, previously required 5 volts or higher to complete write operations.</p><p>This mismatch lead to the integration of complex circuits for voltage step-up or step-down to enable collaboration between logic and memory units. Such integration resulted in additional power consumption, wasted space, and data transfer bottlenecks between logic and memory.</p><p>In typical AI chips, 60 to 90 percent of total power consumption is used for data transfer rather than computation. This has become one of the core constraints limiting improvements in AI computing power and energy efficiency.</p><p>The team from Peking University led by Qiu Chenguang, a senior researcher, and Peng Lianmao, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has developed nano-gate ferroelectric transistors with an ultralow operation voltage of 0.6 volts, successfully shrinking the physical size of the gate to 1 nanometer.</p><p>Reviewers of Science Advances note that these nano-gate ferroelectric transistor devices exhibit excellent memory performance, for the first time achieving voltage compatibility between ferroelectric memory devices and logic transistors. The physical mechanism behind this technology holds significant implications for the development of the memory sector.</p><p>Qiu said their findings resolve the challenge of voltage incompatibility between memory and logic. Data can now be transferred between memory and computing units at the same low voltage with zero barriers and ultra-low power consumption for high-speed interaction.</p><p>He added that the principle underlying this technology is universal and can be applied to mainstream ferroelectric materials.

            "description": "<div data-cover=\"https://img.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/02/112020362526405.jpg\" id=\"news-body\"><p>(Yicai) Feb.18 -- At 10 a.m. sharp, two 1.3-meter-tall humanoid robots in a storefront in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province, sprang to life, twisting and turning in perfect sync to a rhythmic beat. The conclusion of their dance coincided with the country's first-ever 7S humanoid robot store officially opening for its daily business.</p><p>Much like the automotive 4S shops, this novel concept aims to be a one-stop hub. But instead of cars, it focuses on humanoid robots. The 7S model builds on the traditional automobile 4S concept, namely sales, service, spare parts and surveys, by adding solution, show and school functions, thereby covering the entire industrial chain from components and whole machines to scenario-based applications.</p><p>Since opening in November 2025, this store in Wuhan, run by Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, has become a landmark of a shopping mall in the Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, also known as the Optics Valley of China, a tech hub in Hubei.</p><p>China's humanoid robot industry saw significant growth throughout 2025, backed by national and local government mid-to-long-term plans targeting it as a strategic sector. The 7S store represents a pioneering step in exploring viable commercial models and market acceptance for this transformative technology.</p><p>\"In nearly two months, we've received approximately 18,000 visits, becoming a popular tech destination in Wuhan for both locals and tourists,\" said store manager Hu Longdan.</p><p>\"Cumulative revenue has reached almost CNY615,000 (about USD88,600). Humanoid robots are very popular for rentals, having served 10 plus commercial events, while experience projects featuring robot dogs and robot soccer have become major attractions for the youth,\" Hu noted.</p><p>Inside the bustling store, robots of various sizes and shapes demonstrate their capabilities: some play soccer, others serve as retail assistants, while another group plays musical instruments.</p><p>\"We have 17 different models of humanoid robots here, priced from CNY149 to CNY700,000. They can be deployed in over 10 scenarios including industrial manufacturing, cultural tourism guidance, elderly care and special operations,\" said Hu.</p><p>China has intensified its efforts to foster future industries like embodied AI, as outlined in the proposals for the formulation of the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030). The goal is to cultivate new economic growth engines through technological innovation and market exploration.</p><p>The 7S store in Wuhan is part of a national wave of robot-themed retail experiments to promote real-life application of humanoid robots, a key phase for the development of the industry. A think tank report forecasts that by 2045, China will have over 100 million humanoid robots deployed across industries, creating a total market value of approximately CNY10 trillion.</p><p>In July last year, a robot 6S store, said to be the world's first, opened in Shenzhen, a tech hub in south China. A month later, Beijing's Robot Mall, a 4,000-square-meter robot 4S showroom, debuted during a robot consumption festival, featuring more than 50 products spanning medical, industrial and companion robotics.</p><p>The Wuhan store, notably, features a schooling function, addressing the \"last mile\" of skill development, thus standing out when compared to its peers.</p><p>This means the Wuhan store is not just a sales venue but also a \"hands-on experience center\" offering interactive engagement and skills enhancement. Staff members highlight that the store provides robotics operator training, maintenance technician certification and introductory courses for teenagers.</p><p>In addition, corporate engineers can acquire practical skills in operating and maintaining humanoid robots on-site, while middle school students can learn programming and logic through hands-on activities.</p><p>\"We've held 20 sessions, including eight instances of operator training, 12 youth courses and two teacher training events, involving over 1,000 participants,\" said Hu.</p><p>About 65 percent of the trainees are youths, primarily students building foundational skills. Professionals, like engineers and teachers, accounting for 35 percent, seek operational and maintenance expertise. Over 50 professionals, meanwhile, have gained basic robot operation skills via the store programs, Hu revealed.</p><p>The store exemplifies the region's integrated supply chain.</p><p>A key attraction near the store entrance is Yuan You, meaning Far Traveler in English, which is a wheel-footed robot standing 158 cm tall and weighing 72 kg.</p><p>\"It can walk 1.5 meters per second,\" Hu said. \"It's a Hubei native and has been 'working' for nine months at a hospital in the city of Xianning in Hubei, providing guidance, explanations and even moxibustion therapy services.\"</p><p>Yuan Chao, general manager of Wuhan HandX Innovation Technology Co., Ltd, developer of Yuan You, noted that a team from the prestigious Wuhan University had provided both solutions for sensors and AI technology for this robot, while Hubei's local industrial chain supplied over 80 percent of the hardware.</p><p>\"Hubei has roughly 20 core humanoid robot supply chain enterprises and nearly a thousand related firms, allowing us to procure key components like the 'brain,' 'skeleton' and 'electronic skin,'\" Yuan added.</p><p>The first Yuan You was born in April 2025 after just six months of R&amp;D and is now in mass production, with four automated lines capable of producing 1,500 units annually.</p><p>Ensuring these robots are not just produced, but are also capable of performing effectively, is crucial. In June 2025, Hubei established a school for humanoids, known as the Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center. There, newly-born robots are trained by data collectors.</p><p>\"We provide 23 high-fidelity simulation scenarios and over 10 temporary ones, capable of training hundreds of robots simultaneously, collecting more than a million real-machine data points annually,\" said Liu Chuanhou, chief operating officer of the center.</p><p>\"This data, after review, labeling and cleaning, is used for large-model training, enabling continuous robot evolution,\" Liu explained.</p><p>To propel robots from training to real-world value creation, Wuhan has released a three-year action plan and supportive policies, encouraging the development of diverse application scenarios.</p><p>Dong Danhong, director of the Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau, noted that the focus is on unlocking scenarios in hazardous/special operations, manufacturing activities like in the automotive sector, and public services such as elderly care and education.</p><p>Positioning the store as a national window for humanoid robotics, Hu said the 7S store is aiming to secure more than 100,000 visits in 2026, while hosting over 50 training sessions for more than 3,000 participants, thereby nurturing both youth interest and professional talent.</p><p>\"What humanoid robots can do today is still limited, but in the future, they will surely enter millions of households and serve numerous industries, becoming important members of our lives,\" Hu concluded.</p></div>",

If somebody were to approach us and make us an offer that we cannot refuse for portfolio assets, then as sensible businesspeople, we will obviously listen and engage with that.</p><p>“We are not actively out in the marketplace hawking a whole series of what people have called ‘tail brands,’ and nor are we active in a couple of things that you have speculated about,” he added.</p><p>Market talk about a potential sale of Chengdu-based Shui Jing Fang started after Diageo, whose brands also include Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Baileys, and Smirnoff, announced at the end of last year that it intends to divest some non-core assets.</p><p>“Just to be clear, we have never talked about that,” Jhangiani said about the rumors around a potential sale of SJF, a well-known baijiu brand. “That is speculation. And so I won't comment on that further,” he said. SJF has also denied the rumors in the past.</p><p>Baijiu is a fiery white spirit traditionally drunk at social gatherings, banquets, and celebrations in China, but demand has been softening in recent years, with younger drinkers shifting away from strong tipples, according to media reports.</p><p>“As Dave said, we have been clear, no fireside sale of any of these assets,” “We are not sellers, and that still stands,” Jhangiani said. “And more importantly, let the strategy first be laid out, and that will determine what we think about our brands and our portfolio going forward.</p><p>“We are not sellers, and that still stands,” he stressed.</p><p>But SJF may not be off limits, Shen Meng, executive director of Chanson Capital, told Yicai. Lewis did not rule out the possibility that Diageo may consider selling the business in the future, considering the opportunity cost of the slowdown in China’s liquor market, he noted, adding that the proceeds from a sale could be used to seek better returns elsewhere.</p><p>SJF announced last month that it expects net profit to have shrunk 71 percent to CNY390 million (USD57 million) last year on a 42 percent drop in revenue to CNY3 billion (USD440 million).</p><p>Diageo bought its first stake in SJF in December 2006 and later bought more. In 2019, Diageo became SJF’s controller with a direct stake of about 63 percent.</p><p>Diageo’s net sales fell 4 percent to USD10.5 billion in the six months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, its earnings report showed yesterday, mainly because of a weak performance in North America and China.

After the discount, which is the biggest price cut for this model since its launch, the Accord e:PHEV will be reduced to CNY138,800 (USD 20,288) from an official guide price of CNY 238,800. However, GAC Honda stressed that the offer is limited to just 1,000 vehicles.</p><p>Times have changed. Back in the heyday of gasoline-powered cars, buyers often had to pay extra just to get their hands on an Accord. But the latest data tells a different story. In January, the brand’s monthly sales plunged 27 percent from the previous month to a mere 13,800 units.</p><p>Over the past three years, GAC Honda’s 4S dealerships have been rolling out a number of sales promotions. At one point, the actual transaction price of the Accord was more than CNY50,000 (USD7,300) below the official guidance price.</p><p>From the market perspective, there remains intense competition among vehicles priced between CNY100,000 to CNY150,000, which is the mainstream segment of the car market. The automotive consumption index came in at just 31.1 last month, a historic low, according to data from the China Automobile Dealers Association.</p><p>To stimulate demand, more than 10 carmakers, including Tesla, Nio, XPeng and Li Auto, have recently launched seven-year ultra-low-interest financing deals.</p><p>Prices for conventional fuel vehicles continued to edge up in January, while prices for new energy vehicles showed a “declining quantity, rising price” trend, said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

The Ministry of Public Security also released draft auto safety standards last month, which among other things propose that passenger cars should not be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under 5 seconds.</p><p>These rules not only steer innovation in the right direction, but also deliver much-needed protection for consumers in a rapidly changing market, Cisek pointed out. For example, the proposal  to limit acceleration reflects concern about unnecessary performance competition, a stance that aligns well with Volkswagen’s long-standing emphasis on driving safety, he said.</p><p>In response to fierce competition in China’s auto market, Volkswagen is speeding up its strategic transformation. Part of that involves partnering with domestic EV startup Xpeng Motors to jointly develop the China Electrical Architecture, a platform for the electronic and electrical systems in its Chinese cars.</p><p>From next year Volkswagen's three joint ventures in the country will share electrification development platforms, including the CEA. At the same time, Volkswagen Group China Technology based in Hefei, Anhui province will serve as the research and development center responsible for coordinating these efforts, Cisek noted.</p><p>This will help avoid redundant investment while allowing the JVs to tailor products for their specific target users, thereby maximizing synergy, he explained.

Its strategy of prioritizing per-vehicle profit over simply pursuing sales also had a certain impact, he added.</p><p>With the rapid development of Chinese new energy vehicles, the structure of the local auto market has changed, with some high-end domestic cars diverting the traditional luxury market. In addition, luxury brands have been slow in their electric transition.</p><p>Porsche was the first ultra-luxury brand to launch a battery electric vehicle, releasing the electric version of the Taycan in 2019. However, it did not develop any exclusive models for the Chinese market.</p><p>Last September, Porsche announced it would slow down its electrification process, postponing the launch of some BEV models while planning to roll out more fuel cars and plug-in hybrid EVs.</p><p>Porsche sells the Taycan and the Macan BEVs in China, but their performance has not met expectations. It plans to bring the electric editions of the Cayenne and 718 to the Chinese market this year.</p><p>Porsche China will gradually cease operations of about 200 self-built premium charging stations across the country from March 1, terminating related services and removing them from the charging map in the Porsche App and WeChat mini-program, it said at the end of last year.

The newly designed electrolyte allows batteries to retain nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram even at minus 50 degrees centigrade, compared with the 100 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram typical of commercial batteries today.</p><p>The research, published in Nature yesterday, was conducted by scientists from the College of Chemistry at Nankai University and the Shanghai Institute of Space Power-Sources. The team designed a new fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecule and built an electrolyte system that replaces the conventional lithium-oxygen coordination mode found in mainstream electrolytes.</p><p>Electrolytes serve as the key medium for conducting charged ions between the positive and negative electrodes of lithium batteries. Current mainstream electrolytes consist of lithium salts and carbonate solvents and rely on interactions between lithium and oxygen atoms in the solvent to facilitate dissolution. However, poor wettability limits battery energy density, while restricted charge transfer capacity at low temperatures prevents operation below minus 50 degrees centigrade.</p><p>To overcome these constraints, the Nankai University team proposed replacing oxygen atoms with fluorine atoms to enhance the effective dissolution of lithium salts in the electrolyte. The resulting lithium battery achieved an ultra-high energy density of 700 watt-hours per kilogram at room temperature and maintained nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram at minus 50 degrees centigrade, the research showed.</p><p>For comparison, commercial lithium batteries generally offer energy densities between 100 watt-hours per kilogram and 300 watt-hours per kilogram. The 4680 battery developed by electric vehicle maker Tesla, for instance, has an energy density close to 300 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>High-energy-density batteries based on the new electrolyte have broad application potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots, the low-altitude economy, and aerospace, said Chen Jun, associate president of Nankai University, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Agents and third-party traders will not be permitted to export on behalf of title holders, and applicants must include a provincial mining office recommendation letter certifying processing capacity, regulatory compliance, and the mineral composition of the consignment, it added.</p><p>Yahua’s spokesperson noted that traders and agents without local mining licences or processing qualifications are now ineligible to make exports, but stressed that the company can still apply for export permits if it provides supplementary documentation, something the firm has already begun to address.</p><p>All Chinese exports of lithium concentrate from Zimbabwe are on hold pending policy clarification, a spokesperson for Sinomine Resource Group said, adding that the Beijing-headquartered miner has virtually no locally processed lithium products in Zimbabwe and is considering options to extend its supply chain. No plans were ready for disclosure, the person said.</p><p>Sinomine’s stock [SHE: 002738] ended the day 4.8 percent lower at CNY87.59.</p><p>Zimbabwe’s lithium exports \"ban\" is essentially aimed at curbing unauthorised exports, a spokesperson for Huayou Cobalt told the media. The Zhejiang province-based firm’s license was issued by the mines ministry, and the full extent of any impact is still being assessed, the person said. Huayou Cobalt [SHA: 603799] fell 0.8 percent to finish at CNY76.88 in Shanghai.</p><p>Chinese miners have made substantial investments in Zimbabwe’s lithium sector. Bikita, fully owned by Sinomine, is one of Africa’s largest operational lithium mines, with an annual production capacity of about 600,000 tons of concentrate.</p><p>Chengxin Lithium Group has a majority stake in the Sabi Star mine, which produces roughly 300,000 tons of concentrate a year. Huayou Cobalt controls the Arcadia project, an integrated mining-and-processing operation that includes a 50,000-ton-per-year lithium sulfate facility. Yahua, meanwhile, has an interest in the Kamativi mine, which can produce 350,000 tons of concentrate annually.</p><p>Chengxin’s stock [SHE: 002240] gave up 6.5 percent to end at CNY42.26, while Zijin Mining Group [SHA: 601899] -- one of China’s biggest miners -- lost 0.7 percent, closing at CNY39.37.</p><p>The export halt is intended to force leading miners to build local processing plants and create more value domestically, Citic Securities said in a research note. Until new lithium-salt smelting capacity comes online, the brokerage said, the government may still allow limited export windows for large, compliant miners while excluding unlicensed traders and artisanal miners, which will raise export thresholds, boost the industry’s concentration, and benefit Chinese miners already in Zimbabwe.</p><p>Before the ban is lifted, China’s short-term supply of lithium carbonate is likely to tighten and lithium prices could surge, Citic Securities noted. </p><p>A number of Chinese lithium miners without exposure to Zimbabwe rallied. Jinyuan EP [SHE: 000546] surged by its 10 percent daily trading limit to CNY6.83 (USD1), Jiangxi Special Electric Motor [SHE: 002176] added 1.9 percent to CNY10.68, Yongshan Lithium [SHA: 603399] rose 0.9 percent to CNY11.82, [SHE: 001203] and Youngy [SHE: 002192] climbed 3.8 percent to CNY41.34 and CNY58.38, respectively. Yongxing Special Materials Technology [SHE: 002756] gained 3.5 percent to CNY59.</p><p>In recent years, countries rich in lithium, cobalt, nickel, tin, and other strategic minerals have tightened their control, Citic Securities noted, pointing to tin-mining restrictions in Myanmar, cobalt export curbs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and sharp reductions in nickel-ore quotas in Indonesia.</p><p>Amid a broader wave of resource nationalism and intensifying competition between the United States and China over control of critical minerals, further abrupt policy shifts by producer nations are likely, raising the risk of renewed supply disruptions, the brokerage said.</p><p>China imported about 7.75 million tons of lithium concentrate last year, up more than 39 percent from the previous year, mainly from Australia, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria, according to customs data.</p><p>Editor: Martin Kadiev</p></div>",
