In terms of overall NEV shipments, which includes plug-in hybrids, BYD has now ranked first for four straight years.</p><p>BYD’s sales of pure electric cars soared 28 percent last year from the year before to 2.3 million vehicles, the Shenzhen-based automaker said on Jan. 2.</p><p>By contrast, Tesla’s shipments, which were reported on the same day, tumbled 8.6 percent to 1.6 million vehicles in the Austin-based firm’s second consecutive year of declines. The drop has also widened substantially from the 1.1 percent slide logged the previous year.</p><p>BYD’s plug-in hybrid sales slumped 8 percent to 2.3 million units, bringing its overall NEV deliveries in 2025 to 4.6 million units, a year-on-year jump of 8 percent, it added.</p><p>BYD, which started out in 1995 as a manufacturer of lithium batteries, has grown into one of China’s leading makers of electric cars and power batteries. The company stopped producing gasoline-powered autos altogether in 2022 and that same year, its NEV sales surpassed Tesla’s for the first time, earning the top spot globally. In 2024, BYD overtook SAIC Motor to become China’s biggest automaker by sales.</p><p>Rapid expansion overseas has been a key driver of BYD’s growth. In 2025, its sales of passenger cars and pickups abroad surged 145 percent from the year before to one million units, according to company data. The firm’s global footprint has expanded to 110 countries and regions.</p><p>In response to growing uncertainty in international trade, BYD is accelerating the localization of production abroad. Since 2024, the company has built plants in Thailand, Uzbekistan and Brazil. Its first European factory, located in Hungary, is set to be completed and to start production later this year.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

Moving beyond the somewhat stiff dance routines of 2025, its new robots took center stage in a martial arts spectacle, wielding swords and nunchucks alongside human masters from a renowned kung-fu school.</p><p>These robots executed complex maneuvers like drunken boxing, backward obstacle avoidance and backflips, underscoring a leap from demonstrating basic mobility to mastering intricate, culturally rich physical artistry.</p><p>The 2026 gala stunts, supported by AI algorithms and 3D LiDAR, included multiple world firsts: a continuous parkour-style table vaulting sequence, catapulted aerial flips reaching a maximum height exceeding 3 meters, single-leg consecutive aerial flips followed by a two-step wall-run into a backflip, airflare rotation at 7.5 revolutions, and clustered rapid repositioning achieving arbitrary movement speeds of up to 4 meters per second, according to Unitree Robotics.</p><p>\"Unitree should get a robot Olympics going. It would be entertaining, and draw a lot of good attention to how capable humanoid robots are getting,\" Owen Lewis, a science enthusiast, commented on social media platform X in response to the show.</p><p>Another Chinese robotics startup MagicLab, seizing the coveted opening act, set the tone with its human-like machines performing a groundbreaking \"Thomas 360 degree.\" Later, six units synchronized seamlessly with pop stars for a musical number.</p><p>While others showcased physical prowess, Beijing-based Galbot demonstrated its aptitude for performing everyday tasks, from delicately cracking walnuts, picking up glass shards and retrieving items from shelves to folding clothes and skewering sausages for grilling.</p><p>The Galbot robot handled each task with dexterous, natural human-like movements. This capacity for autonomous decision-making and hand-eye coordination signaled that Chinese-designed robotics is moving beyond mere showmanship, instead pointing and shifting toward vast practical applications.</p><p>The most poignant moment of the gala was delivered by Noetix Robotics. Its robots starred in a comedy skit, a throwback to one 30 years ago, when an actress played a whimsical, clumsy robot. This time, she performed alongside authentic humanoids, including a stunningly accurate bionic replica of herself, created in just 30 days.</p><p>The show's classic comedy-of-errors narrative probed a deeper question amid the AI technology wave: human-robot relations. It ultimately affirmed the irreplaceable value of human warmth and connection, suggesting that advanced robotics, rather than replacing humanity, should enhance and reflect our own qualities.</p><p>Noetix's robot, notably, finished second in last year's robot half-marathon in China's capital, following Tien Kung from Beijing.</p><p>This robotics invasion of the gala marks a pivotal cultural and commercial moment. For decades, the event's advertising chronicled China's economic shifts, from bicycles and liquor to home appliances and internet services.</p><p>Now, robots and AI have made inroads into this prime symbolic space, representing the new engine of \"new quality productive forces.\" The performances translated technical jargon like \"embodied AI\" into a visceral, national experience.</p><p>More Chinese robotics firms also took to regional gala stages this year, including the likes of AgiBot, UniX AI and EngineAI, making technology an inescapable part of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide.</p><p>Last week, AgiBot also staged a global live gala, showcasing a diverse lineup ranging from synchronized dances and comedic skits to magic acts and traditional martial arts.</p><p>A recent industry report revealed that Chinese robotics firms had emerged as the largest producers of humanoid robots worldwide in 2025. AgiBot achieved an annual shipment volume of over 5,100 units, securing a 39-percent share of the global humanoid robot market, followed by two more Chinese tech firms, namely Unitree and UBTECH.</p><p>The year 2026 marks a critical turning point for the robotics industry, with it moving from simply \"handling many tasks with limited proficiency\" to truly \"accomplishing tasks with high performance and achieving practical application,\" said Luo Jianlan, chief scientist at AgiBot.</p><p>China has a clear national strategy in its quest to become a global robotics powerhouse, and the country has drawn attention and admiration from abroad thanks to its robust industrial ecosystems, fast iteration cycles and large-scale deployment capacity, said Dominic Gorecky, co-founder and director of Swiss Smart Factory.</p></div>",

That is the most since the CNY25.5 billion sale of the Guangzhou Asian Games City project in 2009.</p><p>The residential component of the mixed-use plot achieved an average floor price of CNY85,000 (USD12,375) per sqm, exceeding the city’s previous record high of CNY75,700 per sqm set at a land auction in late 2023.</p><p>The sale will play a pivotal role in supporting a rebound in the local property market, Xiao Wenxiao, chief analyst for the Guangzhou-Foshan region at real estate think tank Purui Digital Intelligence Technology, told Yicai. It shows that Guangzhou’s land market has entered a new stage following several years of adjustment and is likely to emerge from its downturn this year, he said.</p><p>January and February are the low season for property transactions, while March typically ushers in a spring pickup in activity. With most restrictive housing policies now lifted nationwide, land auctions are expected to show positive signs and help lay the groundwork for a broader market recovery, Xiao said.</p><p>The auctioned land plot was originally a horse-racing track but was converted into a commercial hub for autos, home furnishing, restaurants, and other businesses in 1999.

The country slipped into recession in 2024, with growth forecast at around 0.2 percent last year and expected to recover to only about 1 percent this year, while uncertainty over US trade policy and potential tariff barriers has weighed heavily on German exports, particularly to the US.</p><p>Zheng Chunrong, director of the German Studies Center at Tongji University, told Yicai that the background of Merz’s visit is “rather complex,” noting that voices advocating “de-risking” from China remain influential in Germany’s political discourse.</p><p>Citing Merz, Zheng said that in an era of great power politics, over-reliance on a single major power risks losing strategic flexibility and even being “blackmailed,” making diversification of partnerships an inevitable choice. As China is Germany’s largest trading partner, there is an objective need for cooperation, Zheng added.</p><p>The Chinese scholar pointed out that Merz has made clear that “de-risking” does not equal “decoupling,” and that Germany should continue to seek cooperation in areas aligned with its interests, a stance echoed by several European leaders.</p><p>Business Focus and Industrial Cooperation</p><p>According to Zheng, Merz’s visit carries a dual mission. On the one hand, he is expected to convey the core demands of the German business community to the Chinese side. On the other hand, he plans to visit representative German companies operating in China, including Mercedes-Benz and Siemens, to gain a more intuitive understanding of their operations, cooperation models, profitability, and experience in China’s high-tech sectors, forming a more comprehensive and objective assessment of bilateral economic and trade ties.</p><p>Zheng noted that German investment patterns in China have evolved in recent years. More companies have shifted from exporting products from Germany to relocating production lines and even entire industrial chains to China. Cooperation has moved from one-way technology transfer to two-way integration and joint development, particularly in intelligent vehicles, where the two sides have carried out in-depth joint research and development.</p><p>Merz also plans to visit Chinese high-tech firms such as Unitree Robotics. In these emerging industries, China has taken a global lead in technology and standards and faces fewer constraints from entrenched traditional industry interests, Zheng said, adding that this creates broader scope for mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

However, mainstream non-volatile memory, such as NAND flash, previously required 5 volts or higher to complete write operations.</p><p>This mismatch lead to the integration of complex circuits for voltage step-up or step-down to enable collaboration between logic and memory units. Such integration resulted in additional power consumption, wasted space, and data transfer bottlenecks between logic and memory.</p><p>In typical AI chips, 60 to 90 percent of total power consumption is used for data transfer rather than computation. This has become one of the core constraints limiting improvements in AI computing power and energy efficiency.</p><p>The team from Peking University led by Qiu Chenguang, a senior researcher, and Peng Lianmao, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has developed nano-gate ferroelectric transistors with an ultralow operation voltage of 0.6 volts, successfully shrinking the physical size of the gate to 1 nanometer.</p><p>Reviewers of Science Advances note that these nano-gate ferroelectric transistor devices exhibit excellent memory performance, for the first time achieving voltage compatibility between ferroelectric memory devices and logic transistors. The physical mechanism behind this technology holds significant implications for the development of the memory sector.</p><p>Qiu said their findings resolve the challenge of voltage incompatibility between memory and logic. Data can now be transferred between memory and computing units at the same low voltage with zero barriers and ultra-low power consumption for high-speed interaction.</p><p>He added that the principle underlying this technology is universal and can be applied to mainstream ferroelectric materials. It can also be mass-produced using standard industrial processes, demonstrating strong industrial compatibility.</p><p>Notably, this technology is expected to be used in large model inference, edge intelligence, wearable devices, and Internet of Things terminals in the future.</p><p>Editor: Dou Shicong</p></div>",

            "title": "China's First 7S Humanoid Robot Store Showcases Industry Ambitions",
            "description": "<div data-cover=\"https://img.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/02/112020362526405.jpg\" id=\"news-body\"><p>(Yicai) Feb.18 -- At 10 a.m. sharp, two 1.3-meter-tall humanoid robots in a storefront in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province, sprang to life, twisting and turning in perfect sync to a rhythmic beat. The conclusion of their dance coincided with the country's first-ever 7S humanoid robot store officially opening for its daily business.</p><p>Much like the automotive 4S shops, this novel concept aims to be a one-stop hub. But instead of cars, it focuses on humanoid robots. The 7S model builds on the traditional automobile 4S concept, namely sales, service, spare parts and surveys, by adding solution, show and school functions, thereby covering the entire industrial chain from components and whole machines to scenario-based applications.</p><p>Since opening in November 2025, this store in Wuhan, run by Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, has become a landmark of a shopping mall in the Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, also known as the Optics Valley of China, a tech hub in Hubei.</p><p>China's humanoid robot industry saw significant growth throughout 2025, backed by national and local government mid-to-long-term plans targeting it as a strategic sector. The 7S store represents a pioneering step in exploring viable commercial models and market acceptance for this transformative technology.</p><p>\"In nearly two months, we've received approximately 18,000 visits, becoming a popular tech destination in Wuhan for both locals and tourists,\" said store manager Hu Longdan.</p><p>\"Cumulative revenue has reached almost CNY615,000 (about USD88,600). Humanoid robots are very popular for rentals, having served 10 plus commercial events, while experience projects featuring robot dogs and robot soccer have become major attractions for the youth,\" Hu noted.</p><p>Inside the bustling store, robots of various sizes and shapes demonstrate their capabilities: some play soccer, others serve as retail assistants, while another group plays musical instruments.</p><p>\"We have 17 different models of humanoid robots here, priced from CNY149 to CNY700,000. They can be deployed in over 10 scenarios including industrial manufacturing, cultural tourism guidance, elderly care and special operations,\" said Hu.</p><p>China has intensified its efforts to foster future industries like embodied AI, as outlined in the proposals for the formulation of the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030). The goal is to cultivate new economic growth engines through technological innovation and market exploration.</p><p>The 7S store in Wuhan is part of a national wave of robot-themed retail experiments to promote real-life application of humanoid robots, a key phase for the development of the industry. A think tank report forecasts that by 2045, China will have over 100 million humanoid robots deployed across industries, creating a total market value of approximately CNY10 trillion.</p><p>In July last year, a robot 6S store, said to be the world's first, opened in Shenzhen, a tech hub in south China. A month later, Beijing's Robot Mall, a 4,000-square-meter robot 4S showroom, debuted during a robot consumption festival, featuring more than 50 products spanning medical, industrial and companion robotics.</p><p>The Wuhan store, notably, features a schooling function, addressing the \"last mile\" of skill development, thus standing out when compared to its peers.</p><p>This means the Wuhan store is not just a sales venue but also a \"hands-on experience center\" offering interactive engagement and skills enhancement. Staff members highlight that the store provides robotics operator training, maintenance technician certification and introductory courses for teenagers.</p><p>In addition, corporate engineers can acquire practical skills in operating and maintaining humanoid robots on-site, while middle school students can learn programming and logic through hands-on activities.</p><p>\"We've held 20 sessions, including eight instances of operator training, 12 youth courses and two teacher training events, involving over 1,000 participants,\" said Hu.</p><p>About 65 percent of the trainees are youths, primarily students building foundational skills. Professionals, like engineers and teachers, accounting for 35 percent, seek operational and maintenance expertise. Over 50 professionals, meanwhile, have gained basic robot operation skills via the store programs, Hu revealed.</p><p>The store exemplifies the region's integrated supply chain.</p><p>A key attraction near the store entrance is Yuan You, meaning Far Traveler in English, which is a wheel-footed robot standing 158 cm tall and weighing 72 kg.</p><p>\"It can walk 1.5 meters per second,\" Hu said. \"It's a Hubei native and has been 'working' for nine months at a hospital in the city of Xianning in Hubei, providing guidance, explanations and even moxibustion therapy services.\"</p><p>Yuan Chao, general manager of Wuhan HandX Innovation Technology Co., Ltd, developer of Yuan You, noted that a team from the prestigious Wuhan University had provided both solutions for sensors and AI technology for this robot, while Hubei's local industrial chain supplied over 80 percent of the hardware.</p><p>\"Hubei has roughly 20 core humanoid robot supply chain enterprises and nearly a thousand related firms, allowing us to procure key components like the 'brain,' 'skeleton' and 'electronic skin,'\" Yuan added.</p><p>The first Yuan You was born in April 2025 after just six months of R&amp;D and is now in mass production, with four automated lines capable of producing 1,500 units annually.</p><p>Ensuring these robots are not just produced, but are also capable of performing effectively, is crucial. In June 2025, Hubei established a school for humanoids, known as the Hubei Humanoid Robot Innovation Center. There, newly-born robots are trained by data collectors.</p><p>\"We provide 23 high-fidelity simulation scenarios and over 10 temporary ones, capable of training hundreds of robots simultaneously, collecting more than a million real-machine data points annually,\" said Liu Chuanhou, chief operating officer of the center.</p><p>\"This data, after review, labeling and cleaning, is used for large-model training, enabling continuous robot evolution,\" Liu explained.</p><p>To propel robots from training to real-world value creation, Wuhan has released a three-year action plan and supportive policies, encouraging the development of diverse application scenarios.</p><p>Dong Danhong, director of the Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau, noted that the focus is on unlocking scenarios in hazardous/special operations, manufacturing activities like in the automotive sector, and public services such as elderly care and education.</p><p>Positioning the store as a national window for humanoid robotics, Hu said the 7S store is aiming to secure more than 100,000 visits in 2026, while hosting over 50 training sessions for more than 3,000 participants, thereby nurturing both youth interest and professional talent.</p><p>\"What humanoid robots can do today is still limited, but in the future, they will surely enter millions of households and serve numerous industries, becoming important members of our lives,\" Hu concluded.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div data-cover=\"https://img.yicaiglobal.com/src/image/2026/02/112722659912389.jpg\" id=\"news-body\"><p>(Yicai) Feb. 26 -- China has put 20 Japanese entities, including subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, on an export-control list over their role in Japan's “remilitarization” drive, thereby blocking shipments of “duel-use” items to them, and added 20 more to a watch list that entails stricter scrutiny.</p><p>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Shipbuilding and 19 other entities deemed to contribute to Japan’s military buildup were added to the export-control list, China’s commerce ministry said on Feb. 23. Chinese exporters are prohibited from supplying dual-use items to the listed firms, and overseas organizations and individuals are likewise barred from transferring or providing Chinese-origin dual-use goods to them. Any ongoing related transactions must cease immediately.</p><p>The inclusion of Subaru, the Institute of Science Tokyo, Fuji Aerospace Technology, Mitsubishi Materials, and 16 other entities on the watch list marks its first use. Unlike the export-control list, the watch list does not impose an outright ban but subjects listed entities to heightened scrutiny and risk assessment in the trade of dual-use items.</p><p>The watch list’s first-ever use is the most notable aspect of the move, Ji Wenhua, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics’ School of Law, told Yuyuan Tantian, a media platform affiliated with China Central Television. The ministry said the 20 listed entities may apply for removal if they demonstrate full cooperation with verification requirements, a process Ji said reflects the rule-of-law principles underpinning China’s regulatory framework.</p><p>Under the regulations for controlling exports of dual-use items, which took effect in December 2024, the ministry may put importers of dual-use items on a watch list if their end-users or end-uses cannot be verified.</p><p>The export-control and watch lists target only a limited number of Japanese entities, apply solely to dual-use items, and will not affect normal trade and economic relations between China and Japan, the ministry noted. Law-abiding Japanese businesses have no reason for concern, it stressed.</p><p>The measures are grounded in Articles 29 and 49 of the dual-use export-control regulations, enabling multi-layered oversight covering both direct exports and indirect transfers, while underscoring the extraterritorial reach of China’s export-control regime, Ji said.</p><p>On Jan. 6, the ministry imposed a blanket ban on exports of dual-use items to Japanese military users, for military end-uses, or for any end-use that could enhance that country’s military capabilities.</p><p>Following that, Japanese leaders made remarks on Taiwan that China denounced as violations of the one-China principle and interference in its internal affairs, Ji pointed out. The new dual-list framework creates a more tiered and precise enforcement mechanism, further expanding the country's export control tools, he added.</p><p>Editor: Martin Kadiev</p></div>",

The event sparked a public outcry over environmental damage, countering the principles advocated by the brand, and leading to Amer's share price falling over several consecutive days.</p><p>Arc'teryx's new autumn and winter products for women drove significant incremental growth across multiple core categories, with the ski and insulation series performing particularly well, Amer noted. Climbing pants and soft-shell bloomers launched last year have maintained high market popularity, it added.</p><p>In addition, Amer reported its China revenue surged 43 percent to USD1.9 billion last year from 2024, becoming its second-largest market. Its income from the Americas rose 14 percent to USD2.1 billion, from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa jumped 19 percent to USD1.8 billion, and from the Asia-Pacific region soared 51 percent to USD773 million.</p><p>Net profit of Amer skyrocketed 489 percent to USD427 million in the 12 months ended Dec. 31 from the previous year, with revenue rising 27 percent to USD6.6 billion. The Helsinki-based firm expects revenue growth to slow to between 16 percent and 18 percent this year.</p><p>Amer's strong performance was driven by flagship brand Arc'teryx and the fast growth of premium sports gear brand Salomon, with all business segments, regions, and channels achieving double-digit growth, said Chief Executive Zheng Jie.</p><p>However, Amer faces challenges related to global consumption uncertainty, with the sporting goods industry's annual growth rate likely to slow to 6 percent between 2024 and 2029 from 7 percent between 2021 and 2024, according to a report jointly released by McKinsey &amp; Company and the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry.</p><p>Editor: Martin Kadiev</p></div>",

The Ministry of Public Security also released draft auto safety standards last month, which among other things propose that passenger cars should not be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under 5 seconds.</p><p>These rules not only steer innovation in the right direction, but also deliver much-needed protection for consumers in a rapidly changing market, Cisek pointed out. For example, the proposal  to limit acceleration reflects concern about unnecessary performance competition, a stance that aligns well with Volkswagen’s long-standing emphasis on driving safety, he said.</p><p>In response to fierce competition in China’s auto market, Volkswagen is speeding up its strategic transformation. Part of that involves partnering with domestic EV startup Xpeng Motors to jointly develop the China Electrical Architecture, a platform for the electronic and electrical systems in its Chinese cars.</p><p>From next year Volkswagen's three joint ventures in the country will share electrification development platforms, including the CEA. At the same time, Volkswagen Group China Technology based in Hefei, Anhui province will serve as the research and development center responsible for coordinating these efforts, Cisek noted.</p><p>This will help avoid redundant investment while allowing the JVs to tailor products for their specific target users, thereby maximizing synergy, he explained. The JVs are FAW Volkswagen with FAW Group, SAIC Volkswagen with SAIC Motor, and Volkswagen Anhui with JAC Motors.</p><p>Editors: Dou Shicong, Futura Costaglione</p></div>",

Its strategy of prioritizing per-vehicle profit over simply pursuing sales also had a certain impact, he added.</p><p>With the rapid development of Chinese new energy vehicles, the structure of the local auto market has changed, with some high-end domestic cars diverting the traditional luxury market. In addition, luxury brands have been slow in their electric transition.</p><p>Porsche was the first ultra-luxury brand to launch a battery electric vehicle, releasing the electric version of the Taycan in 2019. However, it did not develop any exclusive models for the Chinese market.</p><p>Last September, Porsche announced it would slow down its electrification process, postponing the launch of some BEV models while planning to roll out more fuel cars and plug-in hybrid EVs.</p><p>Porsche sells the Taycan and the Macan BEVs in China, but their performance has not met expectations. It plans to bring the electric editions of the Cayenne and 718 to the Chinese market this year.</p><p>Porsche China will gradually cease operations of about 200 self-built premium charging stations across the country from March 1, terminating related services and removing them from the charging map in the Porsche App and WeChat mini-program, it said at the end of last year.

The newly designed electrolyte allows batteries to retain nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram even at minus 50 degrees centigrade, compared with the 100 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram typical of commercial batteries today.</p><p>The research, published in Nature yesterday, was conducted by scientists from the College of Chemistry at Nankai University and the Shanghai Institute of Space Power-Sources. The team designed a new fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecule and built an electrolyte system that replaces the conventional lithium-oxygen coordination mode found in mainstream electrolytes.</p><p>Electrolytes serve as the key medium for conducting charged ions between the positive and negative electrodes of lithium batteries. Current mainstream electrolytes consist of lithium salts and carbonate solvents and rely on interactions between lithium and oxygen atoms in the solvent to facilitate dissolution. However, poor wettability limits battery energy density, while restricted charge transfer capacity at low temperatures prevents operation below minus 50 degrees centigrade.</p><p>To overcome these constraints, the Nankai University team proposed replacing oxygen atoms with fluorine atoms to enhance the effective dissolution of lithium salts in the electrolyte. The resulting lithium battery achieved an ultra-high energy density of 700 watt-hours per kilogram at room temperature and maintained nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram at minus 50 degrees centigrade, the research showed.</p><p>For comparison, commercial lithium batteries generally offer energy densities between 100 watt-hours per kilogram and 300 watt-hours per kilogram. The 4680 battery developed by electric vehicle maker Tesla, for instance, has an energy density close to 300 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>High-energy-density batteries based on the new electrolyte have broad application potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots, the low-altitude economy, and aerospace, said Chen Jun, associate president of Nankai University, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

The Chinese firm has already denied the rumors in the past.</p><p>“If somebody were to approach us and make us an offer that we cannot refuse for portfolio assets, then as sensible businesspeople, we will obviously listen and engage with that,” Lewis noted. “What I want to be clear is we are not actively out in the marketplace hawking a whole series of what people have called ‘tail brands,’ and nor are we active in a couple of things that you have speculated about.”</p><p>Diageo’s Chief Financial Officer Nik Jhangiani also answered that question. “As Dave said, we have been clear, no fireside sale of any of these assets,” he noted. “More importantly, let the strategy first be laid out, and that will determine what we think about our brands and our portfolio going forward.</p><p>“One comment about SJF,” he added. “We have never talked about that.
