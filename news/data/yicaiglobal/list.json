In terms of overall NEV shipments, which includes plug-in hybrids, BYD has now ranked first for four straight years.</p><p>BYD’s sales of pure electric cars soared 28 percent last year from the year before to 2.3 million vehicles, the Shenzhen-based automaker said on Jan. 2.</p><p>By contrast, Tesla’s shipments, which were reported on the same day, tumbled 8.6 percent to 1.6 million vehicles in the Austin-based firm’s second consecutive year of declines. The drop has also widened substantially from the 1.1 percent slide logged the previous year.</p><p>BYD’s plug-in hybrid sales slumped 8 percent to 2.3 million units, bringing its overall NEV deliveries in 2025 to 4.6 million units, a year-on-year jump of 8 percent, it added.</p><p>BYD, which started out in 1995 as a manufacturer of lithium batteries, has grown into one of China’s leading makers of electric cars and power batteries. The company stopped producing gasoline-powered autos altogether in 2022 and that same year, its NEV sales surpassed Tesla’s for the first time, earning the top spot globally. In 2024, BYD overtook SAIC Motor to become China’s biggest automaker by sales.</p><p>Rapid expansion overseas has been a key driver of BYD’s growth. In 2025, its sales of passenger cars and pickups abroad surged 145 percent from the year before to one million units, according to company data. The firm’s global footprint has expanded to 110 countries and regions.</p><p>In response to growing uncertainty in international trade, BYD is accelerating the localization of production abroad. Since 2024, the company has built plants in Thailand, Uzbekistan and Brazil. Its first European factory, located in Hungary, is set to be completed and to start production later this year.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

The newly designed electrolyte allows batteries to retain nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram even at minus 50 degrees centigrade, compared with the 100 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram typical of commercial batteries today.</p><p>The research, published in Nature yesterday, was conducted by scientists from the College of Chemistry at Nankai University and the Shanghai Institute of Space Power-Sources. The team designed a new fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecule and built an electrolyte system that replaces the conventional lithium-oxygen coordination mode found in mainstream electrolytes.</p><p>Electrolytes serve as the key medium for conducting charged ions between the positive and negative electrodes of lithium batteries. Current mainstream electrolytes consist of lithium salts and carbonate solvents and rely on interactions between lithium and oxygen atoms in the solvent to facilitate dissolution. However, poor wettability limits battery energy density, while restricted charge transfer capacity at low temperatures prevents operation below minus 50 degrees centigrade.</p><p>To overcome these constraints, the Nankai University team proposed replacing oxygen atoms with fluorine atoms to enhance the effective dissolution of lithium salts in the electrolyte. The resulting lithium battery achieved an ultra-high energy density of 700 watt-hours per kilogram at room temperature and maintained nearly 400 watt-hours per kilogram at minus 50 degrees centigrade, the research showed.</p><p>For comparison, commercial lithium batteries generally offer energy densities between 100 watt-hours per kilogram and 300 watt-hours per kilogram. The 4680 battery developed by electric vehicle maker Tesla, for instance, has an energy density close to 300 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>High-energy-density batteries based on the new electrolyte have broad application potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots, the low-altitude economy, and aerospace, said Chen Jun, associate president of Nankai University, and one of the corresponding authors of the study.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Once the EU’s new customs data hub becomes operational, the interim levy will be replaced by standard customs tariffs.</p><p>The change signals the end of the “volume-driven era” for low-margin e-commerce exports, Zhu Qiuyuan, a law professor at Shanghai Customs College, told Yicai. The cost structure of Chinese cross-border e-commerce will face a complete reset, said Zhu, who is also vice president of the Customs Law Research Association of the Shanghai Law Society.</p><p>The EU imported 4.6 billion e-commerce parcels valued below EUR150 in 2024, with 91 percent originating from China, according to data from the European Parliament. Average daily volume reached 12 million parcels, nearly tripling from 2023 and more than tripling from 2022.</p><p>Under the EU’s plan, it will end the EUR150 customs duty exemption threshold from July 1, 2028, imposing unified tariffs and value-added taxes on all imported goods. It will also introduce a simplified “Duty Buckets” classification system, dividing products into five tax tiers of 0 percent, 5 percent, 8 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent to further standardize customs administration for cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>Zhu added that a customs handling fee for e-commerce parcels will take effect this November. The fee will be independent of the EUR3 levy, with specific standards and the final implementation date yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Beyond the EU, the United Kingdom announced in its autumn budget last year that it will end the GBP135 (USD182) customs duty relief, with the current exemption set to be withdrawn by March 2029 at the latest.</p><p>The moves by the EU and UK underscore a clear global trend toward reducing or scrapping low-value import tax exemptions, Zhu said, urging cross-border e-commerce firms and their logistics partners to closely monitor policy developments.</p><p>Zhu also suggested that small and mid-sized sellers use professional third-party service providers or jointly hire customs consultants in Europe to share costs and achieve compliance. At the same time, sellers should gradually strengthen their own compliance awareness and capabilities, he added. </p><p>As tax breaks for small parcels get phased out, timely adjustments to pricing, logistics, and product selection strategies, as well as a shift toward higher value-added and compliant operations, will be critical to maintaining a foothold in the European market, Zhu said.</p><p>Editor: Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Yet astronomers face a major challenge. Weak signals from remote celestial objects are often obscured by background sky noise and thermal radiation from telescopes.<br/><br/>The study shows that applying the model's \"self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising\" technique to data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extends observational coverage from visible light at around 500 nanometers to the mid-infrared at 5 micrometers. It also increases the detection depth by 1.0 magnitude, effectively enabling the telescope to detect objects 2.5 times fainter than previously possible.<br/><br/>Using the model, the team identified more than 160 candidate high-redshift galaxies from the \"Cosmic Dawn\" period, roughly 200 million to 500 million years after the Big Bang, tripling the number of discoveries using previous methods, according to Cai Zheng, associate professor at Tsinghua's Department of Astronomy and a member of the research team.<br/><br/>Researchers said the AI model can decode massive volumes of space telescope data and is compatible with multiple observational platforms, giving it the potential to become a universal deep-space data enhancement platform.<br/><br/>Traditional noise-reduction techniques rely on stacking multiple exposures and assume noise is uniform or correlated. In reality, deep-space noise varies across both time and space. ASTERIS addresses this by reconstructing deep-space images as a 3D spatiotemporal volume.<br/><br/>Through \"photometric adaptive screening mechanism,\" the model identifies subtle noise fluctuations and distinguishes them from the ultra-faint signals of distant stars and galaxies.<br/><br/>\"Overall, I think this is a very relevant piece of work that can have an important impact across astronomy,\" one reviewer of the research said.<br/><br/>Faint celestial objects obscured by light noise in astronomical observations can be reconstructed with high fidelity, said Dai Qionghai, professor at Tsinghua's Department of Automation.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, researchers expect the technology to be deployed on next-generation telescopes to help address major scientific questions concerning decoding dark energy, dark matter, cosmic origins and exoplanets.</p></div>",

It is designed to connect Guangxi’s largest river, the Xijiang River, with the Qinjiang River, which flows into the Beibu Gulf. The project, with a total estimated investment of CNY72.7 billion (USD10.6 billion), will cut inland voyage distances by more than 560 kilometers and reduce logistics costs for companies by enabling cargo to bypass ports in Guangdong’s Pearl River Delta.</p><p>Wei Tao, chairman of the autonomous region known for its rivers and karst formations, announced the earlier opening on Feb. 25 at an on-site meeting for the project. He said the regional government will make every effort to ensure the canal officially opens, and related ceremonies are held during the China-ASEAN Expo in September. Construction of the 134-kilometer canal began in 2022.</p><p>Wu Jian, director of the Regional Development Institute at Guangxi Academy of Social Sciences, told Yicai that machinery products manufactured in the city of Liuzhou previously had to be transported by rail or road to Guangzhou Port for export, resulting in long transportation cycles and high costs. After the canal opens, these goods can be shipped directly by water to Qinzhou Port in the Beibu Gulf, significantly shortening delivery times and lowering logistics expenses.</p><p>Beyond creating a new logistics corridor, Wu said the canal’s completion and operation will reshape the distribution of local industrial belts, attract related industries to cluster along the route, and enhance companies’ product added value and market competitiveness.</p><p>Hao Panfeng, secretary-general of the China Container Industry Association, told Yicai that the Pinglu Canal is effectively a “waterborne expressway,” and its opening will drive the development of logistics, shipping, and industrial systems along the route.</p><p>Wei also stressed that the development of the canal economic belt must have clear positioning and promote coordinated growth of transport corridors, logistics, trade, and industries, leveraging the canal’s advantages in large-scale inbound and outbound flows by developing modern pillar industries along the route.</p><p>Editors: Tang Shihua, Emmi Laine</p></div>",

Revenue soared 43 percent to CNY49.2 billion (USD7.1 billion).</p><p>The earnings were also driven by the price war among China’s delivery platforms. Starting from the second quarter, major platforms began offering big subsidies on freshly made beverages, igniting a fresh growth spurt in the country’s coffee and milk tea markets. Luckin sold 4.1 billion freshly made drinks, which is roughly equivalent to three cups per person in the country.</p><p>The coffee giant opened 8,708 new outlets last year, a 39 percent annual increase, bringing the total number to 31,048. Average monthly active customers surged 31 percent, and the company had more than 100 million for five consecutive months from June. Same-store sales growth at self-operated outlets recovered to 7.5 percent from minus 17 percent the year before.</p><p>Given the high comparative base resulting from generous subsidies from platforms last year, this year’s same-store sales and profit may face some near-term challenges and swings, Chairman and Chief Executive Guo Jinyi said.</p><p>“China's coffee industry is still in its early stages, with significant growth potential,” he said, adding that short-term bumps in the road will not alter the long-term growth trajectory.</p><p>The competitive landscape is changing, though, Guo said. Brands can no longer rely solely on price, a single hit product, or specific marketing campaigns. This year, Luckin plans to continue opening new stores at a \"competitive\" pace, and will shift its pricing approach to “maintaining competitive pricing while expanding the product price range.”</p><p>In the last quarter of 2025, as the fresh drinks market entered its low season and subsidies started to ease, Luckin’s net profit plunged 39 percent from a year earlier to CNY520 million (USD75.8 million). Revenue climbed 33 percent to CNY12.7 billion (USD1.8 billion).</p><p>Quarterly same-store sales and profit were affected by a combination of seasonal factors, changes in the subsidy strategies of delivery platforms, and adjustments in the product mix, all of which were expected, Guo pointed out.</p><p>Editor: Kim Taylor</p></div>",

The Ministry of Public Security also released draft auto safety standards last month, which among other things propose that passenger cars should not be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under 5 seconds.</p><p>These rules not only steer innovation in the right direction, but also deliver much-needed protection for consumers in a rapidly changing market, Cisek pointed out. For example, the proposal  to limit acceleration reflects concern about unnecessary performance competition, a stance that aligns well with Volkswagen’s long-standing emphasis on driving safety, he said.</p><p>In response to fierce competition in China’s auto market, Volkswagen is speeding up its strategic transformation. Part of that involves partnering with domestic EV startup Xpeng Motors to jointly develop the China Electrical Architecture, a platform for the electronic and electrical systems in its Chinese cars.</p><p>From next year Volkswagen's three joint ventures in the country will share electrification development platforms, including the CEA. At the same time, Volkswagen Group China Technology based in Hefei, Anhui province will serve as the research and development center responsible for coordinating these efforts, Cisek noted.</p><p>This will help avoid redundant investment while allowing the JVs to tailor products for their specific target users, thereby maximizing synergy, he explained. The JVs are FAW Volkswagen with FAW Group, SAIC Volkswagen with SAIC Motor, and Volkswagen Anhui with JAC Motors.</p><p>Editors: Dou Shicong, Futura Costaglione</p></div>",

Its strategy of prioritizing per-vehicle profit over simply pursuing sales also had a certain impact, he added.</p><p>With the rapid development of Chinese new energy vehicles, the structure of the local auto market has changed, with some high-end domestic cars diverting the traditional luxury market. In addition, luxury brands have been slow in their electric transition.</p><p>Porsche was the first ultra-luxury brand to launch a battery electric vehicle, releasing the electric version of the Taycan in 2019. However, it did not develop any exclusive models for the Chinese market.</p><p>Last September, Porsche announced it would slow down its electrification process, postponing the launch of some BEV models while planning to roll out more fuel cars and plug-in hybrid EVs.</p><p>Porsche sells the Taycan and the Macan BEVs in China, but their performance has not met expectations. It plans to bring the electric editions of the Cayenne and 718 to the Chinese market this year.</p><p>Porsche China will gradually cease operations of about 200 self-built premium charging stations across the country from March 1, terminating related services and removing them from the charging map in the Porsche App and WeChat mini-program, it said at the end of last year.

Moving beyond the somewhat stiff dance routines of 2025, its new robots took center stage in a martial arts spectacle, wielding swords and nunchucks alongside human masters from a renowned kung-fu school.</p><p>These robots executed complex maneuvers like drunken boxing, backward obstacle avoidance and backflips, underscoring a leap from demonstrating basic mobility to mastering intricate, culturally rich physical artistry.</p><p>The 2026 gala stunts, supported by AI algorithms and 3D LiDAR, included multiple world firsts: a continuous parkour-style table vaulting sequence, catapulted aerial flips reaching a maximum height exceeding 3 meters, single-leg consecutive aerial flips followed by a two-step wall-run into a backflip, airflare rotation at 7.5 revolutions, and clustered rapid repositioning achieving arbitrary movement speeds of up to 4 meters per second, according to Unitree Robotics.</p><p>\"Unitree should get a robot Olympics going. It would be entertaining, and draw a lot of good attention to how capable humanoid robots are getting,\" Owen Lewis, a science enthusiast, commented on social media platform X in response to the show.</p><p>Another Chinese robotics startup MagicLab, seizing the coveted opening act, set the tone with its human-like machines performing a groundbreaking \"Thomas 360 degree.\" Later, six units synchronized seamlessly with pop stars for a musical number.</p><p>While others showcased physical prowess, Beijing-based Galbot demonstrated its aptitude for performing everyday tasks, from delicately cracking walnuts, picking up glass shards and retrieving items from shelves to folding clothes and skewering sausages for grilling.</p><p>The Galbot robot handled each task with dexterous, natural human-like movements. This capacity for autonomous decision-making and hand-eye coordination signaled that Chinese-designed robotics is moving beyond mere showmanship, instead pointing and shifting toward vast practical applications.</p><p>The most poignant moment of the gala was delivered by Noetix Robotics. Its robots starred in a comedy skit, a throwback to one 30 years ago, when an actress played a whimsical, clumsy robot. This time, she performed alongside authentic humanoids, including a stunningly accurate bionic replica of herself, created in just 30 days.</p><p>The show's classic comedy-of-errors narrative probed a deeper question amid the AI technology wave: human-robot relations. It ultimately affirmed the irreplaceable value of human warmth and connection, suggesting that advanced robotics, rather than replacing humanity, should enhance and reflect our own qualities.</p><p>Noetix's robot, notably, finished second in last year's robot half-marathon in China's capital, following Tien Kung from Beijing.</p><p>This robotics invasion of the gala marks a pivotal cultural and commercial moment. For decades, the event's advertising chronicled China's economic shifts, from bicycles and liquor to home appliances and internet services.</p><p>Now, robots and AI have made inroads into this prime symbolic space, representing the new engine of \"new quality productive forces.\" The performances translated technical jargon like \"embodied AI\" into a visceral, national experience.</p><p>More Chinese robotics firms also took to regional gala stages this year, including the likes of AgiBot, UniX AI and EngineAI, making technology an inescapable part of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide.</p><p>Last week, AgiBot also staged a global live gala, showcasing a diverse lineup ranging from synchronized dances and comedic skits to magic acts and traditional martial arts.</p><p>A recent industry report revealed that Chinese robotics firms had emerged as the largest producers of humanoid robots worldwide in 2025. AgiBot achieved an annual shipment volume of over 5,100 units, securing a 39-percent share of the global humanoid robot market, followed by two more Chinese tech firms, namely Unitree and UBTECH.</p><p>The year 2026 marks a critical turning point for the robotics industry, with it moving from simply \"handling many tasks with limited proficiency\" to truly \"accomplishing tasks with high performance and achieving practical application,\" said Luo Jianlan, chief scientist at AgiBot.</p><p>China has a clear national strategy in its quest to become a global robotics powerhouse, and the country has drawn attention and admiration from abroad thanks to its robust industrial ecosystems, fast iteration cycles and large-scale deployment capacity, said Dominic Gorecky, co-founder and director of Swiss Smart Factory.</p></div>",

Second-hand passenger vehicle transactions edged up 0.4 percent to 15.7 million units, while used commercial vehicle trades climbed almost 8 percent to 2.9 million units.</p><p>Amid the fast expansion of NEV consumption in China, the share of second-hand NEV transactions continued to rise. Used NEV trading volume hit 1.6 million units last year, accounting for almost 8 percent of the total, up from nearly 6 percent in the previous year, CADA said.</p><p>China has also been simplifying procedures for cross-regional used vehicle transactions in recent years, further lifting market activity. The proportion of cross-regional second-hand vehicle trades reached almost 35 percent in December, up from a bit more than 30 percent a year earlier.</p><p>As the industry matures, used vehicle prices have shown greater stability. The average transaction price stood at CNY64,500 (USD9,250) in December, up CNY400 (USD57) from November and CNY1,400 (USD201) from a year ago.</p><p>Second-hand vehicles are increasingly becoming the first choice for young first-time car buyers in China due to their cost-effectiveness, according to a report jointly released in December by ByteDance-backed automotive content platform Dongchedi, also known as Dcar, and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center.</p><p>The report noted that young buyers typically purchase used vehicles priced between CNY50,000 and CNY100,000 (up to USD14,331), place the greatest emphasis on vehicle condition and price, and prefer to complete transactions through online platforms.</p><p>Editors: Dou Shicong; Emmi Laine</p></div>",
