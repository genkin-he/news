Either way, it’s valuable information because another downturn could strike at any time.</p><p>To be sure, many professionals along Wall Street are forecasting that the U.S. stock market will keep rising. But the threat of a sharp drop remains, as it always does. That leaves investors with the luxury now, while prices are high, to reassess. Don’t get lulled into leaving your 401(k) on autopilot, unless you’re intentionally doing so, and make sure your portfolio isn’t stuffed with too much risk. </p><p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><h2>The stock market is doing well?</h2><p>It’s been another fabulous year for stocks. The S&amp;P 500 has soared more than 35% from its low point in April, shortly after “Liberation Day.” </p><p>The market has had a few hiccups recently, as worries have popped up about everything from <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-trump-earnings-21887690dfa4c47d05eebf6153f2e7c4\" rel=\"nofollow\">potentially bad loans</a></span> at some banks to renewed talk about <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-ai-f2c8bcc1f46043ab504cf4b0281e3401\" rel=\"nofollow\">much higher tariffs on China</a></span>. But stocks have come back from each stumble, only to push higher. </p><p>“The market continues to (hit) record highs on the back of strong earnings and easing U.S.–China trade tensions,” said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, who calls the current state of “steady growth without irrational exuberance” a ”Goldilocks environment.” </p><h2>If the market’s great, why should I worry?</h2><p>You don’t need to worry at the moment, but remember that the stock market will fall eventually. It always does. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index, which sits at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, has forced investors to swallow <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-correction-sp-wall-street-904910323785d377a7d61023df450b72\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 10% drop</a></span> every couple of years or so, on average. That’s what Wall Street calls a “correction,” and professional investors see them as ways to clear out excessive optimism that may have built up and pushed prices too high. More serious drops of at least 20%, which Wall Street calls <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bear-market-stocks-market-tariffs-trump-sp-500-c5d106a80666c0ff4f0e71624d525158\" rel=\"nofollow\">“bear markets,”</a></span> are less common but can last for years.</p><p>Back in April, the S&amp;P 500 index plunged nearly 20% from its record at the time. But the market came back, propelled by the big tech companies that have led the way the last few years. </p><p>“Fundamentally superior stocks recover quickly and bounce like fresh tennis balls, while fundamentally inferior stocks bounce like rocks.” said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of asset manager Navellier &amp; Associates, who also brushed off worries that the stock market is in a bubble.</p><h2>What could trip up the market?</h2><p>The stock market has charged to records because investors are expecting several important things to happen. If any fail to pan out, it would undercut the market. </p><p>Chief among those expectations is that big U.S. companies will continue to deliver big growth in profits. That’s one of the few ways they can justify the jumps for their stock prices and quiet criticism that they’ve become too expensive. </p><p>Critics point in particular to the frenzy going on in artificial-intelligence technology. There, they hear echoes of the dot-com bonanza that ultimately imploded in 2000 and sent stocks on a yearslong descent. One popular measure of valuing stocks, which looks at corporate profits over the preceding 10 years, showed the S&amp;P 500 recently was near its most expensive level since the 2000 dot-com bubble. </p><p>Consider Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of the AI trade. If it fails to meet analysts’ high expectations for growth, its stock will look more expensive than it already does. It’s trading at 54 times its earnings per share over the last 12 months, much higher than the overall S&amp;P 500’s price-earnings ratio of nearly 30. </p><h2>What’s the next event to be mindful of?</h2><p>Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve could be a key moment for the market. </p><p>Besides companies delivering bigger profits or stock prices falling, another way for the stock market to look less expensive is if interest rates ease.</p><p>The widespread expectation is that the Fed will cut its main interest rate to support the slowing job market and deliver more reductions through next year. But the Fed has also warned it may hold off on cuts if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level. That’s because lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and Wednesday’s focus will be on whether the Fed gives any hints about the likelihood of more cuts in coming months. </p><p>Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks will also be reporting their latest earnings results this week, including Microsoft and Apple. And Trump will be meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping on Thursday. The market has already run up on hopes that the two will ease <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-united-states-trump-xi-timeline-tariffs-adc2c2c00f13d8dcd4ecc92251b11533\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising trade tensions</a></span> at some point. </p><h2>If there’s a bubble, I should sell everything, right?</h2><p>A famous saying on Wall Street is that being too early is the same as being wrong. </p><p>Consider prescient investors who knew that stocks were too expensive when former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously talked about the possibility of “irrational exuberance” in financial markets. That was in late 1996. </p><p>If they sold then, they would have missed out as the bubble inflated further and the S&amp;P 500 more than doubled through late March 2000 before it popped. </p><p>Instead, the better way to think of it may be: Make sure your investments are set up the right way, so you can stomach the market whether it goes up or down. </p><h2>How much of my 401(k) should be in stocks?</h2><p>It depends on your age and how much risk you’re willing to take.</p><p>If you did sell stocks this past April, you may have had too much of your portfolio in stocks for your risk tolerance. Or you may need to steel yourself more during the next drop. </p><p>Remember that anyone decades away from retirement has the luxury of waiting out any drops in the market. Bear markets are actually great in that case, because they put stocks on sale for anyone continuing to make regular contributions to their 401(k) account.</p><p>Workers closer to retirement still need stocks, though in smaller proportions, because they have historically provided the highest returns over the long term, and a retirement can last decades.</p><p>“They aren’t the most sexy, but companies with dependable dividends are a good bet, as are simple index funds designed to track the S&amp;P 500 or a subset aimed at value or growth,” said John Kiernan, managing editor of personal finance site WalletHub. </p><p>“Young people need to grow their money over time, and they will have decades to make up for any losses,” Kiernan said. “Older people need to protect the money they have now, which might mean favoring bonds and high-yield savings accounts over risky investments.”</p><p>It’s easy to see how much stock retirement savers are recommended to hold at various ages. Mutual-fund companies have target-date retirement funds, which are built as autopilot products that will automatically move investors from lots of stocks when they’re young to fewer stocks when they’re closer to retirement.</p><p>The average target-date fund for workers just starting their careers had 92% of its portfolio invested in stocks at the end of last year, according to Morningstar. Target-date funds designed for people entering retirement have a bit under 50% invested in stocks, meanwhile. </p><h2>I hate all this uncertainty</h2><p>Unfortunately, it’s the price you have to pay if you want the strong returns that the U.S. stock market has historically provided over the long term. </p><p>This is what the stock market does. It goes up and down, sometimes by shocking amounts, but it usually helps patient savers build their nest eggs over decades. </p><p>Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs investments, recommends monitoring volatility by paying attention to the VIX, a volatility index, sometimes called the “fear index, which measures market expectations of future risk. The VIX is currently around 16, which Fulton said signals ”calm by historical standards.” </p><p>“When the VIX begins to hold consistently above 20, it often signals a time to gradually reduce market exposure,” he said. That happened during the tech bubble and more recently during the pandemic in 2020 and when inflation spiked in 2022. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextStoryBody RichTextBody\"><p>NEW YORK (AP) — StubHub received a lackluster reception on Wall Street Wednesday.</p><p>The ticket marketplace’s stock fell 6.4% from its initial public offering price of $23.50 per share on its first day of trading. The company’s shares are trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “STUB.” </p><p>StubHub offered just over 34 million shares and raised approximately $800 million. At the closing price, the company has a market valuation of about $8.1 billion.</p><p>StubHub plans to use proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes.</p><p>The company, which is based in New York, said buyers in more than 200 countries and territories used its platform to purchase more than 40 million tickets in 2024. It was co-founded in 2000 by current CEO, Eric Baker. He will remain CEO and maintain control of the company.</p><p>EBay bought StubHub in 2007. Baker left the company ahead of that sale and founded international online ticket exchange Viagogo in 2006. EBay sold StubHub to Viagogo in 2020 for $4.05 billion, essentially returning it to Baker, who then changed the name of the combined company to StubHub Holdings. It is among the largest platforms for secondary ticket sales. Its competitors include SeatGeek and Vivid Seats.</p><p>StubHub reported just a 3% increase in revenue to $827 million during the first half of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. That puts the company on pace for slower revenue growth after notching a 29% jump for all of 2024.</p><p>Live Nation, which dominates the primary market for ticket sales through Ticketmaster, reported a 1.8% jump in revenue to just under $23.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>StubHub has come under criticism along with the broader ticketing industry over hidden fees and inflated ticket prices. The attorney general for Washington, D.C., sued StubHub last year, accusing the ticket resale platform of advertising deceptively low prices and then ramping up prices with extra fees. The company is also facing pricing and fee inquiries in Pennsylvania and New York.</p><p>Ticket prices for concerts and sporting events have been among the sharper rising costs for consumers over the last few years. Ticket prices rose 5.2% in 2024 after rising 6.8% in 2023, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s consumer price index. Rising ticket prices outpaced the broader increases for overall inflation in both years and that trend has continued through 2025.</p><p>The IPO market is on track for its best year since 2021.

While that’s above the Fed’s 2% target, and it’s more painful than any household would like, it was precisely what economists had forecast.</p><p>That offered some hope that the Fed could continue cutting interest rates in order to give the economy a boost.

Several of those stocks have ridden a wave of meme investment sentiment this year. The move comes two years after the provider of ETFs closed the fund because of slumping interest. The new fund trades under the “MEME” symbol.</p><p>Investors have been sporadically turning to meme stocks throughout 2025 in an effort to find bargains amid a very pricey stock market. The <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-gold-ai-yen-3b5d8a978d326c59cbf484a14868ce66\">S&amp;P 500</a></span> has had a busy year setting records. That has made it more difficult for investors to find stocks at lower prices that have potential for growth.</p><p>“Meme stocks started as a rebellion but have grown into a revolution,” said Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investments. “With MEME, we offer investors a tool to capture that power through an actively managed ETF that can rotate quickly into the stocks dominating the conversation today.”</p><p>The biggest weight in the ETF is Opendoor Technologies, which has had a volatile year. The real estate company’s stock was trading below $1 per share through early July, then surged above $3 that month as hedge fund manager Eric Jackson touted the stock on X. It fell back a bit, then gained more steam and closed above $9 on Tuesday.</p><p>Other heavyweights in the index include Plug Power, which focuses on hydrogen fuel cell technology, and data center company Applied Digital.</p><p>Meme stocks include companies with financial prospects that appear dim, but then gain ground for no seemingly fundamental reason. The stock gains are often fueled by online forums. </p><p>The stocks are often the target of “short sellers,” or investors betting against the stock. That sometimes prompts other investors to start buying the stock in an effort to get the people betting against the stock to do the same in order to cushion their own losses. This starts a cycle that further boosts the stock price.</p><p>It’s a risky strategy and the gains can evaporate as quickly as they came.</p><h2></h2></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextStoryBody RichTextBody\"><p>The Texas Stock Exchange has crossed its latest hurdle toward becoming a direct competitor to the dominance of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.</p><p>The Sept. 30 announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had approved the Dallas-based startup to operate as a national exchange was met with celebration by Texas lawmakers, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who declared “Texas is swiftly becoming America’s financial hub.”</p><p>The hype around the <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://www.txse.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Stock Exchange</a></span>, or TXSE (pronounced Tex-ee), has been building since the June 2024 announcement that the exchange intended to launch with $120 million in backing from large investment firms like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, making it one of the most well-funded attempts at a new national exchange in decades.</p><p>TXSE officials say the strength of the Texas economy made the move possible, noting the many Fortune 500 companies that have come to the state, drawn by favorable regulatory and taxation policies.</p><p>Texas is home to the headquarters of the second most Fortune 500 companies in the country, leading New York and closely trailing California.</p><p>“Texas is a major player in the U.S. regardless of the exchange landscape, but it ultimately makes sense as the 7th largest economy in the world,” Global Managing Director of Listings Nicole Chambers told a gathering of Dallas business leaders in September, adding that 45 countries smaller than Texas have their own stock exchanges.</p><p>“Texas has really become a leader in where you can do business,” Chambers said at the panel discussion at the University of Texas Austin campus. “That is why there is the Texas stock exchange. We couldn’t do this in Oregon or in Nebraska.”</p><p>When TXSE launches — that’s expected to happen next fall — it won’t even be the only stock exchange hosted in Dallas. Following the announcement of TXSE’s intention to seek SEC approval, the New York Stock Exchange in February announced it would reincorporate its Chicago electronic exchange and move it to Dallas, branding it NYSE Texas.</p><p>Bill Bailey, managing director of market intelligence at TXSE, said he sees that decision as a reaction to TXSE’s creation, also noting Nasdaq’s March announcement that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas.</p><p>The moves promise to test whether Dallas’ recent growth into a hub for financial services firms is significant enough to justify the city’s new nickname: “Y’all Street.”</p><h2>Can a startup stock exchange lure companies to join?</h2><p>Stock exchanges are private institutions where stocks, bonds and other securities are traded, connecting supply and demand “like any other market,” University of Texas at Arlington associate professor of finance Sriram Villupuram said.</p><p>The bell ringings on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to signal the start of the day’s trading stand out in the minds of the public, but those events are largely for public relations as the two exchanges compete to convince companies to list themselves on their separate exchanges.</p><p>Since the acquisition of the American Stock Exchange by the NYSE in 2008, the NYSE and Nasdaq have been the two dominant exchanges in the U.S., effectively creating a duopoly, Villupuram said.</p><p>Regional exchanges outside of New York, like the Boston Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange have been swallowed up by the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq, while other exchanges shut down.</p><p>Attempts to create a third, dominant national exchange have largely floundered, failing to attract a significant number of companies that want to list on their exchange.</p><p>TXSE leadership says this time will be different.</p><p>The exchange will be entirely digital but have a physical presence in Dallas, Bailey said. TXSE also intends to hold bell ringing ceremonies for its companies and incorporate much of the pomp and circumstance of its two rival exchanges with its own Texas flair, he added.</p><p>With the $120 million in backing from investors like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, Bailey said the digital exchange will be state-of-the-art and have fewer requirements for the makeup of company boards of directors than other exchanges. TXSE also hopes to capitalize on discontent over new rules and rising fees and share price benchmarks at Nasdaq and NYSE.</p><p>Much of TXSE’s success will depend on the patience of its investors, Villupuram said. It will take time to convince companies to list themselves on the exchange, but each company that does will build momentum. The speed at which TXSE is able to lure its first 50 to 100 companies to the exchange will be crucial, Villupuram added.</p><p>“It gives those that are thinking about listing an idea about what it takes to get on the exchange, and it could snowball from there,” Villupuram said.</p><p>TXSE officials say the exchange’s success will also hinge on the health of the Texas economy. If the economy continues to grow, Texas will continue to attract large companies and financial firms, which TXSE officials can try to recruit into the new exchange.</p><p>Stock transactions are now largely conducted digitally rather than on a trading floor, but a physical presence near major companies is still crucial for a stock exchange, Villupuram said.</p><p>“With stocks, the demand, the trading has become automated, electronic, whatever you want to call it, but the supply, the courting of companies to come get listed with us, that is still very much human to human,” Villupuram said.</p><h2>“The landscape is changing”</h2><p>Historically, Dallas was a trading hub due to its central location in the Sun Belt, making it Texas’ primary location for the communications, transportation and finance industries as the state modernized. That has continued as Texas-based corporations grew and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport became a national travel hub, said Ray Perryman, president of the Waco-based economic research company The Perryman Group.</p><p>“Dallas is the natural location for a financial center to emerge in this region,” Perryman wrote in an email.</p><p>Top investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs now have tens of thousands of employees in the region and are continuing to grow. Goldman Sachs is in the midst of building a $500 million tower in downtown Dallas that will host more than 5,000 employees, which will make it the bank’s largest hub outside of New York, according to the company. Charles Schwab moved its headquarters from California to Dallas in 2020.</p><p>New York has seen just a 16% growth in employment in the investment and securities sector over the last 20 years, while Texas has experienced 111% expansion, Perryman said.</p><p>The state’s lower cost of living compared to the northeast also makes it appealing to employees like Sasha Stratton, head of risk for Selby Jennings in Dallas and the South. The company assists with recruitment for financial services companies across the country. Stratton moved to Dallas from her home state of New York five years ago, seeking the opportunity to purchase a home and live a higher quality of life for less money.</p><p>“(Firms) are prioritizing hiring in Dallas over hiring in New York in a lot of instances, which I think is a pretty unique shift,” Stratton said. “That’s driven by the availability of talent, the cost of operations, the availability of real estate and with the Texas Stock Exchange and other exchanges following suit, realizing it’s not a compromise to be building out in Dallas, it’s actually a smart, strategic decision to take advantage of how booming the economy is.”</p><p>The shift in economic activity to the south paired with the deep pockets of TXSE’s funders suggests the exchange could be a formidable competitor to the NYSE and Nasdaq, Perryman said.</p><p>TXSE’s launch coupled with the expansion of NYSE and Nasdaq to the area will make it easier for growing Texas companies to access capital, allowing for more expansion and hiring, Perryman added, creating a feedback loop that benefits both the exchanges and the Texas economy as a whole.</p><p>“New York will likely remain the primary center of equity markets for the time being, but the landscape is changing,” Perryman said.</p></div>",

Much of the optimism is built on expectations for certain things to happen. If they don’t, the pretty picture on Wall Street could become much uglier. Among the potential concerns:</p><h2>Stocks are expensive</h2><p>This is the easiest criticism to make about the stock market following its nearly relentless rally since April. Stock prices tend to follow the path of corporate profits over the long term, but stock prices have surged much faster than profits lately. </p><p>One measure popularized by Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller, which looks at profits over the preceding 10 years, shows the S&amp;P 500 near its most expensive level since the 2000 dot-com bubble. Some critics have made parallels between that bubble, which saw the S&amp;P 500 eventually halve in value, and the recent AI bonanza. </p><p>It’s not just the big household names in the S&amp;P 500 index raising concern. Ann Miletti, head of equity investments for Allspring Global Investments, has been struck by how much stock prices have shot up for speculative kinds of stocks, such as smaller, money-losing companies. They’ve done much better than their profitable counterparts in recent months. </p><p>She said she’s feeling relatively optimistic about conditions for stocks going into 2026, but “it’s these little bubbles that are concerning to me. When you see things like this, it’s generally not a good thing.”</p><p>To be sure, signals suggesting a too-expensive stock market are famously bad at predicting turning points in the market. Stocks can stay expensive for a while, as long as investors stay willing to pay the high prices. </p><h2>Profits need to climb</h2><p>For stocks to look more typical in valuation, either stock prices need to drop, or corporate profits need to rise. That’s raising stakes for the upcoming profit reporting season. </p><p>Companies are lining up to tell investors how much profit they made during the summer, with PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines scheduled to lead off on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase and other big banks will follow quickly afterward.</p><p>Analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to report collective growth of 8% in earnings per share from a year earlier, according to FactSet. They’ll need not only to hit that target, but also to forecast continued growth for the rest of this year into next. </p><p>That’s even though companies are still trying to figure out how to deal with tariffs, stubbornly high inflation and other shifts in an uncertain economy.</p><h2>The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates</h2><p>One of the main reasons the stock market has boomed is the expectation that the Fed will deliver a string of cuts to interest rates. </p><p>Lower rates give the economy a boost by making it cheaper for U.S. households and companies <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mortgage-rates-housing-interest-financing-home-e08a21c286ea1b3fdaa0f0523f7fd0eb\">to borrow</a></span> and spend. They can also make investors willing to pay higher prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. </p><p>Traders on Wall Street are largely expecting the Fed to cut interest rates at least three more times by the middle of next summer, according to data from CME Group. Fed officials themselves have indicated they’re likely to cut because the job market is slowing. </p><p>But Chair Jerome Powell has insisted they may have to change plans quickly. That’s because inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, and lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel. </p><p>“I feel like interest rates and expectations of what the Fed is going to do are driving everything right now,” Miletti said. </p><p>“If the Fed doesn’t cut as much as people are expecting, any of these areas that look a little speculative, because they’re not based on fundamentals, those areas will have some real problems.”</p><h2>The AI boom needs to pay off</h2><h2></h2><p>“This is the question of the decade,” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group. </p><p>Ma does not feel that AI-related stocks look too expensive, even after their big climbs, but that’s only as long as gangbusters growth and sales for the industry keep going. </p></div>",

September’s jobs figures will be released eventually, once the shutdown ends.</p><p>If the shutdown continues for another week or more, it could also postpone the release of other high-profile data, including the next inflation report, set for Oct. 15. </p><p>The Trump administration has blamed Senate Democrats for the shutdown, while Democrats levy similar charges against the White House. </p><p>“Businesses, families, policymakers, markets, and even the Federal Reserve are flying blind at a key juncture in America’s economic resurgence because the Democrats’ government shutdown has halted the release of key economic data,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. </p><p>Yet President Donald Trump himself has <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-playbook-discredit-unfavorable-data-jobs-5138de0a2abfb45546fe40d70bcca346\">often trashed government jobs data</a></span> when it has painted an unflattering picture of the economy. In August, <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-jobs-firing-f00e9bf96d0110519be9bf4f3ec89195\">he fired</a></span> the then-head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency reported that job gains in May and June had been sharply lower than previously reported. </p><p>For now, economists are turning to alternative measures of the job market provided by nonprofits and private-sector companies. Those measures mostly show a job market with little hiring, but not many layoffs, either. Those who have jobs appear to be mostly secure, while those looking for work are having a tougher time. </p><p>Payroll processor ADP, for example, <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://adpemploymentreport.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said Wednesday</a></span> that its estimate showed the economy had lost a surprising 32,000 private-sector jobs last month. Companies in the construction, manufacturing, and financial services industries all cut jobs, ADP found. Restaurants and hotels, and professional services such as accounting and engineering, also shed workers. </p><p>Businesses in health care, private education, and information technology were the only sectors to add workers, ADP said. </p><p>“We’ve seen a significant decline in hiring momentum throughout the year,” said Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist. “This is consistent with a low hire -- even a no-hire — and low fire economy.”</p><p>Austan Goolsbee, before becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in January 2023, was one of those busy economists on the first Friday morning of the month, often dissecting the data for the financial news network CNBC. Now he still checks the data Friday mornings and has a team of research economists that analyze the report.</p><p>“It’s still the best data -- the BLS numbers are the best labor market numbers in the world,” Goolsbee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “And when we don’t have them, we suffer.”</p><p>Just last month, however, the Chicago Fed began issuing its <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\" href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/chicago-fed-labor-market-indicators/latest-release\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">own estimates</a></span> of the unemployment rate and other job-market indicators, using a combination of public and private-sector data, which it updates every two weeks. On Thursday, its latest figures put the unemployment rate in September at 4.3%, the same as in August and still low historically.</p><p>Goolsbee said the Chicago Fed prefers to focus more on rates, such as the unemployment figure, and layoff and hiring rates, as an indicator of recession risk, because they are less affected by changes in immigration patterns and the aging of the U.S. workforce than the changes in total jobs.</p><p>Still, while there are alternative measures of hiring and unemployment, there are fewer sources of information on inflation, which the Fed is charged with keeping stable and low. Prices have picked up in recent months for many imported goods, mostly because of tariffs, but Goolsbee said that he is closely watching inflation in services, which have perked up in the past two months. Higher services prices are a potential sign that inflation is spreading beyond just imported products.</p><p>Goolsbee is eager to see the next inflation report to see if the trend continues. “That makes the government shut down, lack of BLS data that much more concerning,” Goolsbee said.</p></div>",
