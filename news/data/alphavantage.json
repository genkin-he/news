Fuller Company (FUL), highlighting its standing as a moderately advantaged industrial chemicals company with strong B2B relationships and steady cash flow. While the company operates in a cyclical market, its diversified exposure, disciplined management, and reasonable valuation make it an attractive investment, despite other AI stocks potentially offering higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article notes that H.B. Fuller is not among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, with 24 hedge funds holding FUL shares at the end of the third quarter.",
