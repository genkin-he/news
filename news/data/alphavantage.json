These moves aim to refine the company's portfolio and governance around land, wood products, and climate opportunities. While these changes are significant, the article notes that the investment narrative still largely hinges on cyclical lumber pricing and housing demand, with long-term forecasts projecting notable revenue and earnings growth by 2028.",
