Concurrently, the company landed a significant commercial order from United Airlines for GEnx engines, though it flagged supply chain risks tied to rare earth materials. Despite a stretched valuation, these strategic wins and partnerships are critical for investors to watch, especially considering GE's multi-year stock gains.",

            "summary": "Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) reported Q4 earnings that met expectations, but its stock weakened due to concerns about global tariffs and regulatory issues in education. Despite a recent decline, the stock is still up significantly over the longer term. Simply Wall St's analysis suggests LOPE is undervalued at $156.90 compared to a fair value of $213 per share, attributing this to scalable technology investments and operational efficiency, although there are risks from potential softening student demand and rising regulatory costs.",
