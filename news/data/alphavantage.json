Using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, the stock appears undervalued by 33.6% with an intrinsic value of $462.30 per share compared to its current price of $307. However, its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.99x is deemed \"about right\" when compared to Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio of 34.36x, despite being above the industry average.",
