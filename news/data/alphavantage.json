Discovery assets, citing \"financial discipline\" after Paramount Skydance made a superior all-cash offer for the entire company, including its legacy cable networks. While Netflix's proposal focused on valuable IP like HBO, Paramount is acquiring WBD's substantial debt and less valuable linear television assets. Despite losing this battle, Netflix's strategic decision to avoid taking on WBD's full debt and less desirable assets highlights its continued strength and focused approach in the streaming industry.",
