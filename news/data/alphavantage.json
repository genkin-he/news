            "summary": "Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) reported Q4 2025 revenues of US$1.6 billion and FFO of US$340 million, with basic EPS rising from US$0.15 to US$0.20. Despite this strength and a 9.8% earnings increase year-over-year, analysts forecast a 7.8% decline in EPS over the next three years. The article discusses how these strong recent results challenge the bearish outlook, though a one-off US$167 million gain complicates the underlying earnings trend.",

While an analyst narrative suggests the stock is 26.4% undervalued with a fair value of $338.57 due to growth in GLP-1s and high-margin components, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model indicates it is overvalued at $102.89.
