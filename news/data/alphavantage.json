(NASDAQ:PRAA) increased significantly by 61.6% in February, reaching approximately 1.27 million shares, which represents about 3.3% of its float with a days-to-cover ratio of 2.0. This surge occurred despite the company reporting better-than-expected Q4 earnings, with EPS of $1.46 against an estimated $0.50 and revenue of $333.4 million versus $288.9 million. While the stock saw a 24.3% jump to $15.75 after the positive earnings, analysts maintain a consensus \"Hold\" rating with an average price target of $25.00, expressing skepticism about sustained recovery and emphasizing the need for improved acquisition execution and collection efficiency.",

OCUL's pipeline, especially for wet AMD and diabetic eye disease, makes it a valuable target, with rumors suggesting a bid of around $30 per share. Upcoming top-line results are expected to be a key catalyst, potentially leading to significant investor returns through acquisition or continued development of its ocular therapies.",
