            "summary": "Ashford Hospitality Trust, a REIT with 68 U.S. hotels, plans to offload 18 more properties beyond the three recent sales announced as part of its strategy to deleverage and strengthen its balance sheet. The company reported significant net losses for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, attributing them to industry pressures like negative revenue per available room, elevated interest rates, and reduced government spending. Despite a loan default on eight hotels, Ashford Hospitality aims for a leaner, stronger portfolio through strategic dispositions and operational improvements, including a focus on upcoming event-driven opportunities.",
