While the latest quarterly results showed a return to profitability, the integration costs and increased debt have compressed overall margins, raising questions about Herc's long-term margin strategy. Investors are closely watching the company's ability to stabilize margins and manage leverage as it continues to absorb its largest acquisition to date.",
