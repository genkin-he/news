The firm anticipates a deceleration in housing and industry dynamics, limiting upside for 2026 due to macro headwinds and tough comparisons in China, though it sees potential for higher earnings long-term through expanded offerings and secular growth. This comes after other analysts like Stifel and Baird also adjusted their price targets following A.O. Smith's mixed Q4 results, where adjusted EPS beat consensus but revenue guidance was light.",
