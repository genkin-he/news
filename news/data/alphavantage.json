While Disney's Experiences segment is performing well, the acquisition would require substantial debt financing, and Norwegian Cruise Line itself carries significant liabilities and is under activist pressure from Elliott Management. The deal's complexity, coupled with Disney's current financial situation and leadership transition, makes its feasibility uncertain despite the strategic fit.",
