While this concentration doesn't automatically signal a bubble and has historically led to strong returns, it does heighten risk by eroding diversification and making markets more sensitive to sentiment shifts. The author suggests investors consider diversification strategies, such as selective stock-picking, equal-weighting, or balancing US exposure with international equities and other asset classes, to mitigate these risks.",
