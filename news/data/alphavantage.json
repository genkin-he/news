            "summary": "CoStar Group (CSGP) concluded FY 2025 with strong revenue growth but notably thin profitability, reporting US$900 million in Q4 revenue and US$0.11 basic EPS. Despite significant revenue increase, net profit margins are at a mere 0.2%, down from 5.1% a year prior, which raises questions about the translation of revenue into sustainable earnings. Analysts project high revenue growth and increased margins in the future, yet the company's current volatile EPS and declining five-year earnings trend present a conflict between bullish growth expectations and current financial performance.",
