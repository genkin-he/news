This comes as Starbucks reported an earnings per share miss of $0.56 against an expected $0.59 but beat revenue estimates at $9.92 billion, setting its FY2026 EPS guidance between $2.150 and $2.400. Despite the trimmed position by Erste Asset Management, other institutional investors like Nordea, Asset Management One, Providence, and Allstate either increased or initiated positions in SBUX, with analysts maintaining a \"Moderate Buy\" consensus and an average target price of $104.31.",
