CEO Brett Schulman highlighted the company's \"investment in the guest\" by largely holding back menu price increases, even in anticipation of California's fast-food wage increase.",

Rodriguez and CFO Joel Ackerman, will be speaking at several major healthcare conferences in 2026, offering investors insights into the company's capital allocation, growth priorities, and approaches to the kidney care business. These appearances provide opportunities to understand management's views on care models, technology adoption, payer relationships, and how they address risks like reimbursement pressure and treatment volume variability. Investors should watch for consistency in commentary and how DaVita positions itself against competitors like Fresenius and Baxter, especially considering concerns about the company's debt being poorly covered by operating cash flow.",
