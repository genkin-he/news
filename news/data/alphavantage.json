The drugmaker plans to use the proceeds, estimated at $7.95 billion, primarily to pay down borrowings from an existing $4.0 billion loan, with potential use for other general corporate purposes. This financial move and the performance of its newer immunology drugs, Rinvoq and Skyrizi, are under investor scrutiny amid concerns about future funding costs and market conditions.",
