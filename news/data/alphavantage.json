Macroeconomic factors, such as higher-than-expected US PPI data signaling persistent inflation and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's policies, also contributed to the decline. Institutional investors showed mixed sentiment, with some trimming their positions while others increased holdings, further impacting market perception.",

While Teradyne has an average brokerage recommendation of 1.65 (approximating Strong Buy), the article cautions against relying solely on these recommendations due to potential positive bias from brokerage firms. Instead, it suggests validating such recommendations with the Zacks Rank, which has identified Teradyne as a #1 (Strong Buy) due to recent positive earnings estimate revisions.",
