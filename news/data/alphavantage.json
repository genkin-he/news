The report highlights a decline in ROI concerns and an increase in firms reporting measurable business benefits from GenAI initiatives, including growing adoption and reported returns in the Asia Pacific region. This shift indicates that AI is proving its capability to modernize the financial industry at speed.",

This comes after other analysts like Stifel and Baird also adjusted their price targets following A.O. Smith's mixed Q4 results, where adjusted EPS beat consensus but revenue guidance was light.",
