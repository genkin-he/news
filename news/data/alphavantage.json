The author highlights the substantial wealth accumulated by the Frist family through their ownership stakes and control, asserting that they are the primary beneficiaries of the hospital's profits. The article criticizes the \"oligarchic ownership\" model, suggesting it prioritizes profit maximization over patient care and calls for holding the Frist family legally and morally responsible.",
