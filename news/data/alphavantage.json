Inflation is forcing a shift of trillions in sidelined cash into productive investments, and private credit is emerging as a crucial third engine for financing long-term growth alongside traditional bank debt and equity. This evolution is reshaping Japan's corporate landscape, attracting global investors, and impacting strategic decisions for major companies like Sony and Panasonic Automotive.",

(INTU) while lowering its price target to $650, anticipating strong fiscal Q2 results despite a short tax e-filing period and seeing potential upside from Credit Karma. Intuit also recently launched the TurboTax \"Done-For-You\" experience, a hybrid model combining Agentic AI with expert support to streamline tax preparation. Although Intuit is considered a strong investment, some AI stocks may offer greater upside potential with less risk.",
