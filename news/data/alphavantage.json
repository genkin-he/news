Despite a recent earnings miss, the company's predictable regulated returns and infrastructure spending are expected to expand its rate base and drive future earnings growth. TIKR's valuation model suggests a target price of $137, implying a 23% upside due to regulated rate base expansion, capital discipline, and consistent earnings.",
