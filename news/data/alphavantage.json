Demonstrations showed AI-assisted and AI-guided modes kept vessels in safe zones up to 94% of the time, compared to 63% for human control, and reduced recovery time by 61%. This technology, developed under DARPA's LINC program, has the potential to revolutionize control over maritime vessels, and eventually aircraft and land vehicles.",
