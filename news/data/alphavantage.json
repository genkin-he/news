Carey (WPC) reported FY 2025 results with US$444.5 million in Q4 total revenue and US$288.1 million in FFO, demonstrating steady cash generation from its real estate portfolio. Despite a one-off gain of US$121.2 million affecting net income quality and a slight decrease in net margin to 27.2%, the company's FFO performance supports the bullish net lease narrative centered on inflation-linked rent escalators. However, a premium valuation (P/E of 34x) against weaker interest and dividend coverage raises concerns found within the bear case.",
