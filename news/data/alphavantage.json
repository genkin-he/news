Despite a full year of positive trailing earnings (US$2.47 EPS), three out of four quarters in FY 2025 were loss-making, raising questions about margin quality and the sustainability of profits. The company's low P/E ratio compared to peers conflicts with a DCF fair value significantly below its current share price, while concerns about debt coverage and projected earnings declines present a challenge for the bullish outlook.",
