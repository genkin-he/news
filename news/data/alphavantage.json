The company has shifted from net losses to significant profitability, with trailing twelve-month revenue of US$2.7 billion and basic EPS of US$0.99. Despite a high P/E ratio compared to the industry and negative shareholders' equity, bulls argue the company's projected growth and DCF valuation suggest undervaluation, while bears focus on balance sheet risks.",
