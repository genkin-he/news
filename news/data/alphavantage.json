While the most followed narrative suggests a 7% overvaluation with a fair value of $111.40, a different perspective on multiples points to good value given its P/E ratio of 16.3x compared to industry averages. Investors are urged to examine the financials and consider key rewards and warning signs to determine if the stock is undervalued or if its growth is already priced in.",
