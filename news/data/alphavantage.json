Bernstein upgraded Newmont to Outperform with a $157 price target, projecting gold at $4,800 by 2026 and $6,100 by 2030, citing Newmont's strong exposure to rising bullion prices. Upcoming economic data, particularly the February U.S. Employment Situation report on March 6, could influence gold prices and Newmont\u2019s stock performance next week.",

This outlook supports the company's investment narrative, although investors should consider the risk of consumers favoring repairs over full equipment replacements.",

Fuller Company (FUL), highlighting its standing as a moderately advantaged industrial chemicals company with strong B2B relationships and steady cash flow. While the company operates in a cyclical market, its diversified exposure, disciplined management, and reasonable valuation make it an attractive investment, despite other AI stocks potentially offering higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article notes that H.B. Fuller is not among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, with 24 hedge funds holding FUL shares at the end of the third quarter.",

The company is under investor scrutiny ahead of several upcoming catalysts, including an investor conference on March 3rd and an ex-dividend date on March 5th, where investors must hold shares for the 12.5-cent quarterly payout. Despite recent buybacks and a focus on hard-disk drives, the stock faces pressure due to its cyclical nature and a \"fair value\" assessment significantly below its current trading price.",
