(LCR.DE) saw an after-hours drop of 6.97% to \u20ac45.77 on February 26, 2026, driven by investor concerns over high net leverage and mixed free cash flow growth. Despite healthy margins, key metrics like net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity weigh on sentiment, with upcoming earnings on April 22, 2026, adding short-term uncertainty. Meyka AI rates LCR.DE as a \"HOLD\" with a score of 66.86/100, projecting a 12-month target price of \u20ac52.11, indicating potential upside, but advises caution due to technical signals and leverage risks.",
