His legacy includes navigating rapid international expansion and serving on the Board of parent company Pigeon Corporation to contribute a global perspective to its long-term strategy. Vyse-Peacock has chosen to step away from day-to-day leadership to focus on mentoring and supporting the growth of purpose-driven businesses, much like Lansinoh, while reducing the extensive international travel that has defined much of his tenure.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">\"Lansinoh has been a defining chapter of my life,\"</em> said Vyse-Peacock. <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">\"What began as a small entrepreneurial venture grew into a global organization with an extraordinary mission and an exceptional team.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Elena Vardon </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Swiss Re's shares traded higher after the reinsurer paired its quarterly results with a surprise $1 billion share buyback, signaling a more aggressive stance on capital returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Zurich-based group on Friday said that it would repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares over the course of the year. The program includes the introduction of a recurring annual $500 million buyback as announced late last year, plus the $1 billion top up. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The stock climbed around 5% in early trading to hit its highest level since before a December investor day that had weighed on shares. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  J.P. Morgan analysts described the unexpected extra buyback as \"the culmination of a number of resilience building activities and strong [Swiss Solvency Test ratio].\" The move reflects a pattern of proactive capital management often seen as pricing cycles soften, where underwriters prioritize capital returns over chasing volume, Jefferies wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods struck a more cautious note and questioned the sustainability of such payouts as the total capital return slightly exceeded net operating capital generation for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  For the full year, Swiss Re reported a 47% jump in net profit to a record $4.8 billion, beating its own guidance of more than $4.4 billion for 2025. The increase was driven by disciplined underwriting and a benign catastrophe environment in its property and casualty units, which helped offset a weaker showing in its life and health business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Performance in the last three months of the year was more nuanced. Swiss Re's net income reached $717 million, beating the company-compiled consensus of $687 million but falling sharply from the $1.05 billion recorded a year earlier. The top-line was also softer as insurance revenue slipped 6% to $11.14 billion while its investment result fell 12% to $966 million, with both metrics trailing consensus expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The quarterly print was weighed down by a review of underperforming life and health portfolios in Australia, Israel and South Korea. Swiss Re had warned this would shave off $250 million from its fourth-quarter earnings, leading it to miss its the division's annual profit target. While the review is now completed, analysts remain divided with some noting that the managed impact should reassure while others cautioned it may take some quarters of clean results to believe the issues are in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"All three of our business units are positioned to deliver consistent results,\" Chief Executive Officer Andreas Berger said. The company maintained its $4.5 billion net profit target for 2026, which includes a $1.7 billion contribution from the rehabilitated life and health business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In addition to the buybacks, the board proposed a 9% increase to its annual dividend to $8.0 per share. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Elena Vardon at elena.vardon@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 04:39 ET (09:39 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

It supports long work hours, relaxation, gaming, and creative routines. In response, Dowinx has built its product approach around one principle: comfort should stay reliable over time.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Rather than designing mainly for appearance or short-term feel, Dowinx includes long-term performance standards from the start of product development. Key modules—including frames, seat cushions, and reclining mechanisms—are tested independently before full-chair assembly.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Dowinx evaluates major components through repeated validation. Load-bearing structures undergo high-frequency pressure testing, backrest and adjustment systems complete thousands of stability cycles, and cushion materials are assessed for rebound and deformation recovery. This modular engineering process helps Dowinx maintain stable overall performance while introducing new features.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Engineering Data Snapshot</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">30,000+ pressure and fatigue test cycles on load-bearing structures</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">Thousands of stability cycles for backrest and adjustment systems</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">Cushion rebound and deformation recovery testing for long-term seating consistency</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">BIFMA-related standard validation for key components, with selected parts tested to enhanced internal durability benchmarks</li></ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Dowinx believes engineering should serve everyday life. Each structural test and cushion validation is designed to support users through long work sessions, downtime, and daily routines with consistent comfort.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"We do not pursue a short-lived 'wow' feeling when someone first sits down,\" said a Dowinx product development lead. \"Dowinx designs chairs to fit naturally into daily life and provide dependable comfort over time.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Dowinx also improves efficiency through a vertically integrated supply chain. By overseeing core production processes and working directly with material suppliers, Dowinx reduces intermediary costs and invests more in cushion structure, support systems, and safety performance. This approach enables Dowinx to offer feature-complete seating solutions at accessible price points.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Beyond manufacturing, Dowinx emphasizes long-term ownership experience through transparent warranty policies, responsive customer support, and stable replacement-part availability.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As remote and hybrid work continue to expand, Dowinx remains focused on seating solutions that balance comfort, durability, and value. Dowinx believes a well-designed chair should quietly support work, creativity, and rest as a trusted part of everyday life.We are not simply manufacturing chairs—we are redefining the relationship between you and your home workspace.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Dowinx</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Dowinx is a user-focused ergonomic furniture brand dedicated to designing gaming chairs that combine functional engineering, reliable craftsmanship, and long-term comfort.
