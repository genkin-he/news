The national negative list for foreign investment has been reduced to 29 items and fully cleared in manufacturing. Visa-free policies now cover 76 countries through unilateral or reciprocal arrangements, making it easier than ever for foreign businesspeople, tourists and professionals to invest, work and live in China. As Xi emphasized, \"Partnering with China means embracing opportunities. Believing in China means being optimistic about tomorrow. And investing in China means investing in the future.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">China's growing connectivity with the region is reflected in trade data. According to the General Administration of Customs of China, in the first three quarters of 2025, trade between China and other APEC economies rose 2 percent year-on-year to 19.41 trillion yuan (around $2.73 trillion), accounting for 57.8 percent of China's total foreign trade.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Meanwhile, China's steady economic growth continues to provide certainty for the region and the world. Over the past five years, despite increasing external shocks, China has maintained an average annual growth rate of around 5.5 percent, contributing approximately 30 percent to global growth.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Sevim Dagdelen, a German politician and a member of the Bundestag, said China has always advocated building an open and inclusive Asia-Pacific cooperation framework and upholding the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, which plays a positive role in promoting regional and even global economic stability.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">'Right path forward'</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As Xi described, the world today stands at \"a new crossroads\" between cooperation and hegemonism. In this context, he called on all economies to strengthen solidarity, reject protectionism, resist unilateralism and work together to build an Asia-Pacific community so as to further boost peace and development in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To guide such cooperation, Xi outlined five proposals at his Session I speech: upholding the multilateral trading system, fostering an open regional economy, safeguarding industrial and supply chain resilience, advancing digital and green trade, and promoting inclusive development that benefits all.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">These ideas are already taking shape. China-initiated platforms such as the APEC Port Network and Green Supply Chain Network have become vital hubs for digitalized and sustainable trade across the region. Over the past five years, China has ranked first in global goods trade and second in services trade, attracting more than $700 billion in foreign investment and maintaining outbound investment growth above 5 percent annually.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">China's technological collaboration continues to empower Asia-Pacific and global partners - from smart ports in Latin America and mobile payment systems in Southeast Asia to AI-powered efficiency projects in the Middle East and electric vehicle production in Thailand. Together, these examples form a mosaic of shared progress grounded in openness and innovation.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Public sentiment mirrors this vision. A recent CGTN poll found that 83.2 percent of respondents across the Asia-Pacific expressed confidence in regional integration, while 84.6 percent agreed that economies should uphold multilateralism and globalization.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As China prepares to host APEC for the third time next year, its message remains clear and forward-looking.

The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year.

In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slip 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -- </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Gold Rises With Focus on U.S.-China Trade, Fed Rate-Cut Prospects -- Market Talk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  0847 GMT - Gold prices rise in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. \"We expect gold prices to remain elevated in the coming weeks, especially as central bank purchases remain high,\" analysts at BMI say. However, \"risks are slated to the downside as the Fed has downplayed the possibility of another cut in December and the trade deal between the U.S. and China has abated a lot of the uncertainty in the market.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -- </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Palm Oil Prices to Be Supported Near Term -- Market Talk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  0428 GMT - Prices of palm oil are expected to remain supported in the near term, underpinned by strong demand from India, BMI says in a note. Despite the commodity's narrowing price advantage over soybean oil, which could slow exports, BMI thinks palm oil remains competitively priced, providing a stable demand floor. BMI raises its 2025 average crude palm oil price forecast to 4,320 ringgit a ton from 4,150 ringgit a ton. Over the long term, slower production growth in Malaysia and Indonesia, due to land and environmental constraints, is expected to keep palm oil prices structurally firm, with a slight easing to 4,300 ringgit a ton in 2026, BMI adds.

A trade deal between the two economies should stabilize relations, though underlying tensions remain unresolved, they say. Recent mine supply disruptions have weighed on Chinese smelters competing over shrinking supply flow, which prompts an industry association to urge Beijing to curb new capacity with stricter controls on projects, they note. Meanwhile, a stronger U.S. dollar weighs on investor appetite after Fed chair Powell warned investors need to rein in expectations for a December rate cut.

These include consistent central-bank allocation and investor buying of gold across various investment products, the head of markets strategy says. \"All these purchases of gold have one key common important motivation, i.e. the need for safe haven diversification of portfolio amidst the increasingly volatile de-dollarization narrative,\" he adds. UOB maintains its positive outlook for gold and raises price forecasts by $100/oz each to $4,000/oz by 4Q 2025, to $4,100/oz by 1Q 2026, to $4,200/oz by 2Q 2026, and to $4,300/oz by 3Q 2026.

The two oils often move in tandem due to their use in similar products. While increased soybean oil supply could weigh on demand for crude palm oil, firm biodiesel demand under Indonesia's B50 mandate, seasonal monsoon-related production slowdown and lower Malaysian inventories should limit downside risks. Unless China significantly scales up its soybean imports from the U.S., the overall impact on palm oil fundamentals may remain limited, she adds. TA maintains a neutral rating on Malaysia's plantation sector. It rates United Malacca at buy, Kuala Lumpur Kepong at hold, and SD Guthrie and IOI at sell.

Disruption is the alternative to transformation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Should an individual begin transforming themselves today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: You have to. Steve Jobs said that first we have to change ourselves, then we change our industry, and then we change the world. We have to transform ourselves to deliver greater value and then gain the ability to transform the industries that we work in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Is AI going to be more transformative than the internet? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: It will be bigger. When the internet came, it was all about making things more efficient, but humans were still doing the work and software was making them more efficient. With AI, you're basically saying it will do the same job as a human for the most part. When ChatGPT first arrived, every CEO in every industry and in every country was thinking about what to do with it. It was the first time a technology hit the zeitgeist across the entire world at the same time (i.e., it became a global cultural phenomenon). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Many employees fear that AI means job loss. How can leaders introduce it in a way that builds trust and gets people on board? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: Change is scary for a lot of people, which is why trust matters. If AI people came into your company and said to your employees, \"We are going to transform your business,\" the natural response is that you're going to kill their jobs. That's because you didn't take the time to build trust. Instead, tell them, \"We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.\" They would embrace it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Which companies are getting AI adoption right today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: In my book I talked about companies such as Applied Intuition, Hippocratic AI, Stripe and Commure. Some of the AI model companies are obviously doing very well. If you look at the consensus, it would be OpenAI and Anthropic. There are also open-source companies, such as Mistral, that are building AI models that are quite interesting. There are also companies that are imagining modern call centers, the evolution of the legal department, how accounting is being done with AI, how marketing and sales are going to be done using AI, and how to empower sales reps. Those types of companies are going to be very, very interesting over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest risks of AI adoption? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja:  We are going to transition from a culture of solving problems to a culture of asking questions, which will be a big transition. We want to make sure we're not losing our cognitive capabilities, our ability to think, and our ability to solve problems. How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? There is a trap you can fall into, whereas these technologies get better and better, and you stop thinking. Think about how to get from point A to point B today. People turn on the map program and lose all touch of how things are laid out physically. You don't want that to happen to all concepts in your brain. It is a downside if we become too reliant and give up sharpening our own cognitive skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What are the key steps leaders must take to successfully integrate AI into their organizations? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There are four steps leaders must take to make AI work: First, they have to change their data infrastructure and their IT (information technology) department so they can adopt AI. Then they must train them with the data. Next, they have to change their workforce because they now have humans and AI working together. What a lot of CEOs got wrong is they didn't realize that the only way a profound change will happen in their company is if they demonstrate courage and conviction. They have to encourage their people to take risks and show them how it will make them more successful. Otherwise, people get scared, and they won't use it. That's how a lot of organizations get stuck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What is the biggest cautionary lesson leaders should keep in mind as they adopt AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There will always be those who use AI for societal harm. We have to trust the system to build the right guardrails. Over time, this technology will be properly regulated in terms of who gets access to it and how it gets applied. Like any new technology, it could be bumpy. I have an optimistic view that human beings will find a way to leverage these profound technologies for good in the aggregate, such as what happened with nuclear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: With AI reshaping so many industries, how can employees protect their careers and make sure they thrive in an AI-driven workplace? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: The most concrete and useful advice I can give is to learn how to adopt AI to do your job more effectively. That's really what you should be doing. This means asking the right questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and being more strategic in your own work. It's a huge opportunity for employees. In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What guidance would you give recent graduates entering today's fast-changing job market? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: To understand that the world is going to change a lot in the next few years. When kids used to graduate 10 years ago, they would list all the software they knew how to use on their resume. Now we're in a world where that software is changing every three months, and you're constantly having to learn and keep up to be effective at your job. Being a lifelong learner is important. The world is an empty canvas. Let's have AI shape the world to be what we want it to be. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Looking ahead, how do you see AI reshaping society and business in the years to come? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: AI is a transformative force, and we have an amazing opportunity in front of us to transform society, to transform nations, to transform industries, and to transform our own business with AI with this mindset of abundance, of building companies that are truly focused on purpose and profit. We need to find the ingredients required to be able to build companies that can be agents of such transformations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Sincere is the author of several books, including \"Understanding Stocks,\" \"Understanding Options,\" and \"Help Your Child Build Wealth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: The AI boom is over - here's your bubble survival guide </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Michael Sincere </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple sees iPhone trends improving, but analysts note its stock is more expensive than other hardware and smartphone plays like Qualcomm and Alphabet </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple gave a rosy iPhone sales forecast on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple's talk of faster iPhone sales growth had some on Wall Street hopeful for a sustained recovery, but other analysts saw better investment options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Apple (AAPL) have lagged behind the \"Magnificent Seven\" - and the S&amp;P 500 - with their 8% year-to-date gain through Thursday's close. Among investor concerns were a lack of innovation in the iPhone business and a failure to capitalize on artificial intelligence the way other Big Tech players have. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In that sense, Apple's talk of robust iPhone 17 demand and plans for heightened AI spending came as some comfort, helping to drive Apple's stock 2% higher in Friday morning action. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst at Radio Free Mobile, said, \"iPhone replacement demand is more robust than it has been for several years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Apple earnings send the stock higher on upbeat iPhone commentary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But wasn't sold on a long-term Apple rebound, saying that some form-factor changes to the iPhone 17 may simply be getting iPhone users to upgrade iPhones earlier than they planned, meaning the company isn't seeing a sustainable change in its growth trajectory. The company is also dealing with the \"black hole that is its AI strategy,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Windsor noted that Apple shares are trading at a higher multiple than shares of fellow hardware players Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), MediaTek Inc. (TW:2454), Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KR:005930) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), despite growth struggles for the iPhone manufacturer. \"I would own any of these over Apple any day of the week,\" he wrote, while disclosing positions in Samsung and Qualcomm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Below are the forward price-to-earnings multiples for those five names, based on FactSet data </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Company                             Forward P/E \n   Apple                               33.02 \n   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  25.05 \n   MediaTek                            17.64 \n   Qualcomm                            14.41 \n   Samsung                             13.07 </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Needham's Laura Martin thought Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) stock (GOOG) looked like a more intriguing play than Apple's, given that shares of the Google parent company trade at a discount to Apple shares despite far better growth prospects. Alphabet's stock trades at 25.8 times forward earnings, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet's revenue is growing two to three times faster than Apple's, Martin added. And the internet giant has a more tangible strategy around large-language models and generative AI than Apple does, plus leading or near-leading positions in AI, search, mobile, video and the cloud, according to Martin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple faces a \"key strategic problem,\" in her view, because it can only use generative AI to enhance its ecosystem. Alphabet can use generative AI to improve Android as well - but through the cloud it can also \"charge a fee for thousands of other companies to use its LLM, which aids its enterprise profitability and gives it the ability lower Android prices and improve its operating leverage faster,\" she wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS's David Vogt joined the others in flagging Apple's high stock multiple. He acknowledged that \"near-term iPhone demand is solid,\" but said Apple shares were trading at 34 times his estimates for fiscal 2026 earnings, making for a premium of 40%-plus relative to the S&amp;P 500 SPX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Based on historical relative valuations, material share price appreciation in our view will likely have to come from positive earnings revisions,\" he wrote, as it's been \"difficult to sustain\" a premium of that magnitude. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Alphabet's stock looks like a better play than Meta's in the AI race </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
