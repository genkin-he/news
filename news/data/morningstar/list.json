Founder and CEO Ray Chen reflected on the brand's journey, sharing insights into its origins, values, and future direction.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">A Vision Inspired by Possibility</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">At the heart of TWOPAGES' decade-long journey is a simple but powerful idea: to make life at home easier, more beautiful, and more human. Years ago, while renovating his home, Ray Chen encountered hidden fees and a confusing curtain-buying process. What should have been a joyful part of creating a dream home had instead turned into a frustrating burden, prompting Ray Chen to explore possibilities beyond the traditional approach.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"That's how TWOPAGES came to life. We are not just a curtain brand — we are a solution,\" said Ray Chen. Determined to simplify the curtain-buying process, he built TWOPAGES on honesty, care, and innovation. From convincing factories to accept smaller custom orders to developing a user-friendly online platform, he introduced a more accessible approach to home furnishings. Today, TWOPAGES operates a 100,000-square-meter factory, sources from 100+ suppliers, and delivers over 1,000 custom orders daily, serving over 600,000 households worldwide.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808609/Image_Source_Ray_Chen_Founder_TWOPAGES.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808609/Image_Source_Ray_Chen_Founder_TWOPAGES.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Craftsmanship Meets Innovation</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">TWOPAGES is built on a philosophy of balance, where craftsmanship seamlessly blends with innovation. \"We use technology to express beauty, and craftsmanship to realize beauty,\" said Ray Chen.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This pursuit of balance is also embodied in the brand's very name. One \"page\" of the TWOPAGES story reflects emotional warmth, which is expressed through fine fabrics, precise tailoring, and artisanal finishing that bring comfort to everyday living. The other represents innovation and efficiency, showcased through smart measurement tools, menu-style customization, and fast, transparent delivery. Together, these elements empower TWOPAGES to redefine modern home design as accessible, effortless, and deeply meaningful.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Connection at the Core</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The TWOPAGES TOGETHER celebration also marked the finale of the TWOPAGES TOGETHER × Design Contest, a global co-design initiative inviting creators to explore new expressions of window aesthetics.

Only by understanding can we truly serve.\" That belief extends to the brand's global presence, reflected in its recent Times Square and Los Angeles billboard campaigns, which featured real designers and customer stories.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Through this contest and today's gathering, we're reminded that design is never just about aesthetics — it's about connection,\" Ray Chen added. \"That's what TWOPAGES TOGETHER truly stands for.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">From an online startup to an international brand, TWOPAGES' evolution mirrors Ray Chen's original vision that simplicity and trust should be at the heart of every home. Looking to the next decade, Ray Chen's ambition remains as grounded as it is forward-looking. \"Our dream is to use technology to save people time — and then help them invest that saved time into what truly matters: spending time with family, enjoying a quiet coffee in the afternoon sun, creating memories, feeling happiness,\" he said.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808611/Image_Source_TWOPAGES_TOGETHER_x_Design_Contest_Finale_1.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808611/Image_Source_TWOPAGES_TOGETHER_x_Design_Contest_Finale_1.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About TWOPAGES</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Founded in 2015, TWOPAGES is a global home décor brand dedicated to creating premium, customizable window treatment solutions.

In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree.'Hemant Taneja </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hemant Taneja is a venture capitalist, author and CEO of General Catalyst, recognized for his insights into how artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and economies. Taneja was an early investor in companies including Stripe , Snap (SNAP), Grammarly, and Anduril, with a focus on applied AI, healthcare transformation and responsible innovation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His new book, \"The Transformation Principles: How to Create Enduring Change\" (co-authored with Kevin Maney), outlines nine principles for companies and managers to create sustainable change. Under Taneja's leadership, General Catalyst has raised billions of dollars while emphasizing ethical AI deployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In this recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Taneja discusses how individuals and companies can transform themselves, notes AI stocks with growth potential, and explains AI's huge risk and major opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What's the central message of your new book, and why is it timely now? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: We are entering a technology cycle where AI is going to be a transformative force, and it's going to transform many industries. There is an opportunity to actually make capitalism work for everybody if we make the right intentional choices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What does a company need to do to have a successful transformation through AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: For an organization to be transformative, it needs to have a culture of curiosity and generosity. They need to transform, but not disrupt. Disruption is the alternative to transformation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Should an individual begin transforming themselves today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: You have to. Steve Jobs said that first we have to change ourselves, then we change our industry, and then we change the world. We have to transform ourselves to deliver greater value and then gain the ability to transform the industries that we work in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Is AI going to be more transformative than the internet? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: It will be bigger. When the internet came, it was all about making things more efficient, but humans were still doing the work and software was making them more efficient. With AI, you're basically saying it will do the same job as a human for the most part. When ChatGPT first arrived, every CEO in every industry and in every country was thinking about what to do with it. It was the first time a technology hit the zeitgeist across the entire world at the same time (i.e., it became a global cultural phenomenon). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Many employees fear that AI means job loss. How can leaders introduce it in a way that builds trust and gets people on board? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: Change is scary for a lot of people, which is why trust matters. If AI people came into your company and said to your employees, \"We are going to transform your business,\" the natural response is that you're going to kill their jobs. That's because you didn't take the time to build trust. Instead, tell them, \"We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.\" They would embrace it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Which companies are getting AI adoption right today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: In my book I talked about companies such as Applied Intuition, Hippocratic AI, Stripe and Commure. Some of the AI model companies are obviously doing very well. If you look at the consensus, it would be OpenAI and Anthropic. There are also open-source companies, such as Mistral, that are building AI models that are quite interesting. There are also companies that are imagining modern call centers, the evolution of the legal department, how accounting is being done with AI, how marketing and sales are going to be done using AI, and how to empower sales reps. Those types of companies are going to be very, very interesting over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest risks of AI adoption? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja:  We are going to transition from a culture of solving problems to a culture of asking questions, which will be a big transition. We want to make sure we're not losing our cognitive capabilities, our ability to think, and our ability to solve problems. How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? There is a trap you can fall into, whereas these technologies get better and better, and you stop thinking. Think about how to get from point A to point B today. People turn on the map program and lose all touch of how things are laid out physically. You don't want that to happen to all concepts in your brain. It is a downside if we become too reliant and give up sharpening our own cognitive skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What are the key steps leaders must take to successfully integrate AI into their organizations? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There are four steps leaders must take to make AI work: First, they have to change their data infrastructure and their IT (information technology) department so they can adopt AI. Then they must train them with the data. Next, they have to change their workforce because they now have humans and AI working together. What a lot of CEOs got wrong is they didn't realize that the only way a profound change will happen in their company is if they demonstrate courage and conviction. They have to encourage their people to take risks and show them how it will make them more successful. Otherwise, people get scared, and they won't use it. That's how a lot of organizations get stuck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What is the biggest cautionary lesson leaders should keep in mind as they adopt AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There will always be those who use AI for societal harm. We have to trust the system to build the right guardrails. Over time, this technology will be properly regulated in terms of who gets access to it and how it gets applied. Like any new technology, it could be bumpy. I have an optimistic view that human beings will find a way to leverage these profound technologies for good in the aggregate, such as what happened with nuclear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: With AI reshaping so many industries, how can employees protect their careers and make sure they thrive in an AI-driven workplace? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: The most concrete and useful advice I can give is to learn how to adopt AI to do your job more effectively. That's really what you should be doing. This means asking the right questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and being more strategic in your own work. It's a huge opportunity for employees. In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What guidance would you give recent graduates entering today's fast-changing job market? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: To understand that the world is going to change a lot in the next few years. When kids used to graduate 10 years ago, they would list all the software they knew how to use on their resume. Now we're in a world where that software is changing every three months, and you're constantly having to learn and keep up to be effective at your job. Being a lifelong learner is important. The world is an empty canvas.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Paul Hannon </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of England is set to take a big step toward embracing uncertainty as it follows through on the recommendations made by former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke after a review that was critical of its forecasting record. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Published in April 2024, the Bernanke review was one of the first steps taken by a leading central bank to understand why it underestimated a surge in prices that began in early 2021 and has yet to be fully tamed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Bernanke recommended that the BOE place more stress on developments that could upend its expectations for the U.K. economy and future interest rates, and less emphasis on a \"central\" forecast for growth and inflation that communicated too much certainty about the future. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The BOE has been edging away from its pre-Bernanke practices over the intervening period, and has offered a number of scenarios for growth and inflation that members of the Monetary Policy Committee have referred to in speeches as a way of setting out how their decisions might change with the circumstances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But the most decisive step forward will come Thursday, officials said, when the BOE publishes its quarterly Monetary Policy Report alongside its latest rate decision, which investors expect to be a hold at 4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Staff at the BOE outlined the reasoning behind the shift in a paper published earlier this month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The intention behind the changes is to highlight uncertainties about the outlook and how they might affect the path of interest rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  There will be more scenarios, and they will come with possible paths for the key rate, although those will be determined by policy rules formulated by the BOE's economists, rather than reflecting the views of individual rate setters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"As with any other input, there is no mechanical link between policy simulations and real-world monetary policy decisions,\" staff wrote in their paper. \"And these tools are stylised and simplified. So, they do not accurately reflect the MPC's real-world reaction function.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That is a distinction that reflects the BOE's continued reluctance to employ the \"dot plot\" favored by the Federal Reserve, which gives the interest rate forecasts of individual voting members. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  However, the nine members of the MPC will be given around 200 words each to explain their view of the rate decision and the outlook. Previously, the MPC's debate had been summarized by BOE officials, and the identities of the members making the arguments referred to in the minutes had been kept hidden, although their votes had not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  One of Bernanke's key recommendations was that policy makers should be clear when they as individuals don't fully believe in the assumptions that underlie the central forecast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The MPC's forecasts for growth and inflation are based on the assumption that the interest rate they set changes as investors expect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But policy makers often have a very different view of how rates should change, and that has led to confusion. In late 2022, for example, the BOE forecast that the U.K. economy would enter a deep recession, but that forecast assumed rates were going to rise more sharply than policymakers intended. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  What policymakers were actually doing was signaling that they wouldn't raise the key rate as rapidly as investors expected because such a big move in borrowing costs would tank the economy. However, business and consumer confidence was weakened by the recession call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central forecast is not going away, but it will play a less important role in decision making, as Bernanke recommended. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 09:44 ET (13:44 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jamie Chisholm </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about stock market exuberance build as AI tech spending sees shift to debt </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Burry was quoting the famous line from the movie Wargames, presumably about his willingness to participate in the AI-fueled bull market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's getting choppy. The heavy weighting afforded the megacap tech stocks meant the reception given to their third-quarter earnings was very likely to determine the stock market's short-term direction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And so, poorly-received reports from Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw the wider market retreat sharply on Thursday, while positivity over Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) results are pushing indices back up on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The volatility speaks to investors' sensitivity to any sign of cracks in the bullish AI narrative that is currently delivering stock market exuberance. And we can consider Michael Burry of hedge fund Scion Asset Management in the cautious camp. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a new message on X, Burry - who rose to fame after being featured in the Michael Lewis book \"The Big Short\" and was played by Christian Bale (below) in the movie  - delivered a poetic warning: \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" the latter a reference to the nuclear-showdown assessment from the movie Wargames. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because he is mainly known for his bets against esoteric credit assets ahead of the 2007-08 financial crisis, Burry is wrongly labelled as a perennial bear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that at the end of last year SAM held only long positions, with his top three bets on China's Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the end of the first quarter of 2025 he had tuned more cautious buying put options - a bet share prices will fall - on the three China tech companies. His biggest position was a put trade on Nvidia (NVDA), which did trend lower for the first four months of this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burry's next filing for the end of June shows that negative Nvidia position gone - though we don't know exactly when he closed it - which is just as well, because the chipmaker's stock has more than doubled since its April lows. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Instead, the portfolio was replete with bullish bets, including call options - the right to buy a stock - on Alibaba, Meta, ASML (ASML), UnitedHealth (UNH), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and lululemon athletica (LULU). Scion has held shares of Estee Lauder (EL) all year, the only constant. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burry's next 13-F for his holdings up to the end of September is due in about two weeks. It's still possible that it contains mainly long positions - after all the end of the third quarter was a month ago. But his latest social media message suggests he is nervous about the stock market's rally, and he's now adopting a much more defensive stance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One reason why observers like Burry may be getting more anxious is evidence of a shift in the funding of big tech capex. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Traders have been happy to see hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for AI-related investment, particularly as most of the money was sourced from company cashflow. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But Meta's recent deal to construct its Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, included a $30 billion financing package comprising mostly of debt held via a special purpose vehicle. The structure means Meta does not hold the debt on its balance sheet, helping to protect its credit rating. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The concern among some investors is that as companies look for ever more funding to deploy, they may use the Meta deal as a template. Spending cash from the kitty is clean, clear and less dangerous if things go wrong. Financial engineering using what could be called quantum debt, which can be two things at once - not debt according to the rating agencies, but Meta-backed debt according to the buyers - is more opaque and potentially more risky. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Financial Times and Bloomberg report that Meta is also looking at another $25 billion bond sale. Right now there's a prospectus filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission without a specified amount. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock-indices SPX DJIA COMP are higher at the opening bell as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y nudge up.

And it was something that Kelly Ripa, co-host of TV's \"Live with Kelly and Mark,\" addressed recently in a rant that has gotten attention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You know, we give good candy. Full-size candy. You think they'd take the win and say, 'Thank you.' But they go, 'I don't like Hershey's, can I get a Snickers bar? I want Skittles,'\" Ripa said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Her solution? \"I am tired of dealing with this. So, now I'm getting opaque bags and putting the candy in the bags and you get what you get. Bye-bye. See you later.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Ripa was speaking about the situation in New York City, there are no shortage of people complaining about the Halloween greed factor wherever they live. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One commenter on Reddit took note of kids who \"would grab a handful [of candy] when I would say 'grab 2 or 3.'\" Another commenter observed: \"It's not even little kids that are raiding the sweets, it's the older ones from 10-12 and teenagers and college kids that keep on taking the sweets.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Others describe scenarios even worse than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jan Norris, a resident of Riviera Beach, Fla., had to leave her home for a few minutes during one recent Halloween. So she put up a sign asking trick-or-treaters to take a limited amount of candy. But when she returned, she found everything was gone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I couldn't get over the audacity,\" she told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neither could Enid, a New Jersey resident who declined to give her last name. Not only did trick-or-treaters take all her candy one year after she, too, left her treats unattended, but they also swiped her porcelain Halloween bowl. Even more disturbing: Someone played a prank and damaged her electric doorbell, necessitating a repair that cost several hundred dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Enid told MarketWatch that she's given up on taking part in the Halloween ritual as a result. \"We're lights off,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Halloween is more expensive this year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, there are plenty of folks who continue to embrace the holiday - so much so that Halloween sales are projected to reach a record $13.1 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Candy sales account for $3.9 billion of that total. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There do appear to be growing expectations of full-size candy bars being doled out instead of the mini or \"fun size\" versions that were long the Halloween norm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But consumers may be feeling especially pinched this year when it comes to candy. Prices for the sweet treats are higher, particularly because of the rising cost of chocolate. Wells Fargo recently reported that cocoa prices have more than doubled since the beginning of 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tariffs have also had an impact on Halloween costs - most notably for decorations and costumes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Combine the greed factor with the price hikes and you have a recipe for misery, some say. In certain cases, people are reporting that their candy budgets are now $200 or more. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Moneyist (2024): This Halloween, I'm not buying candy for trick or treaters. I have better things to spend my money on. Am I a bad person? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not that you can't find ways to save. Some consumers say they find deals by shopping at warehouse clubs like Costco (COST), or through Amazon (AMZN). They can even find full-size bars at a decent price at those places. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Even with concerns about price increases due to tariffs, Halloween continues to resonate with consumers of all ages,\" said Katherine Cullen, vice president of industry and consumer insights at the NRF. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But as the NRF data suggest, it doesn't look like folks are giving up on the idea of spending big for Halloween - just the opposite, in fact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for problematic and demanding trick-or-treaters, Darby Fox, a child and family therapist based in the New York metropolitan area, says that's symptomatic of the times. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We don't teach manners anymore,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fox added that Halloween provides a good opportunity for parents to teach their children to be polite and graciously accept any treats they're offered. If anything, she suggests the holiday should be celebrated more as a fun, community event rather than a sugary free-for-all. \"It shouldn't be about the candy,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some also suggest that people should put the greed factor into perspective. That's the view of Lizzie LeBontemps, an artist who has made a specialty of Halloween songs. She notes there are still plenty of grateful trick-or-treaters out there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I get rude, greedy kids every single year - and also every single year, I get polite, delightful ones who compliment my decorations and exclaim with a delighted 'Thank you!' when I hand them treats,\" LeBontemps said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
