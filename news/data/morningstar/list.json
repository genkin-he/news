The facial is now available by appointment, and has already generated a growing waitlist.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A Widespread Problem the Beauty Industry Has Largely Ignored</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Declining estrogen doesn't just bring hot flashes and night sweats. It quietly dismantles the skin. Research shows that women lose nearly a third of their dermal collagen in the first five years after menopause, with collagen continuing to decline at roughly 2% per year for the following decade. The skin thins. Moisture vanishes. Elasticity disappears. Facial hair increases. Inflammation spikes. And yet, despite affecting every woman who lives past midlife, the issue gets almost no attention.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A large-scale global survey of more than 4,300 peri- and post-menopausal women, presented at the International Master Course on Aging Science World Congress in 2026, found that over 50% of women learned about menopause's impact on their skin only after experiencing it themselves. The three most commonly reported skin changes were lines and wrinkles (59%), loss of firmness and elasticity (58%), and increased dryness (56%). Beyond the physical toll, the survey found that 60% of women said these skin changes made them feel less attractive, 57% reported increased anxiety, and 55% felt less confident. (Read more about the Galderma Survey <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=3571775963&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.galderma.com%2Fnews%2Fgalderma-tackles-menopause-related-skin-changes&amp;a=HERE\" tabindex=\"0\">HERE</a> ) </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Perhaps most damning: a separate study found that almost one in two women was not aware that menopause affects the skin at all - and 61% said they felt insufficiently informed about menopause overall. Even among women who had discussed menopause with a doctor, more than a third still didn't know.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A Ten-Step Treatment Built on Personal Experience and Clinical Research</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Meno \"Pause\" Facial® was created by Sinead Norenius, founder and owner of <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=84267847&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innovitalespa.com%2F&amp;a=InnoVitale+Spa\" tabindex=\"0\">InnoVitale Spa</a> . Norenius began her career as a paramedical esthetician for a plastic and reconstructive surgeon in Southern California before going on to work with global brands including Yon-Ka Parisand St. Tropez Tan. In 2008, she founded Beautisol, a skincare company distributed on HSN and in spas and salons nationwide, and later launched iFabbo, an influencer marketing and technology platform. Both companies were subsequently acquired, and Norenius transitioned to the technology sector, where she served as a product management executive leading global development teams at billion-dollar SaaS companies.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Then menopause hit - early, and without warning. When Norenius entered perimenopause, she experienced the same confusion and isolation that millions of women describe: unexplained skin changes, a lack of useful clinical guidance, and the distinct sense that she was navigating something significant completely on her own. A subsequent Stage 2 malignant melanoma diagnosis deepened her commitment to developing solutions that genuinely serve women at this stage of life.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">\"The lack of public education and awareness around menopause is well-documented,\" said Norenius. \"For me, the experience was isolating. I didn't want other women to feel that way. I wanted to create something that actually worked and that treated women with the respect this transition deserves.\"</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The result is a comprehensive ten-step facial that targets the most common and disruptive menopausal skin concerns: severe dehydration, dryness, increased facial hair, loss of elasticity, dullness, and inflammation. The treatment addresses the specific questions women ask most: Why is my skin suddenly so dry? Why am I breaking out again in my 40s and 50s? Why does my skin look dull and lifeless? What can I actually do about the new facial hair?</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Where Traditional Technique s Meets FDA-Cleared Technology</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">What sets the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® apart from standard anti-aging treatments is its integration of Celluma® light therapy, an FDA-cleared red light therapy device. Celluma's technology delivers cellular repair, enhanced circulation, acne treatment, and reduced inflammation, addressing four of the most persistent and under-treated challenges of menopausal skin.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Red light therapy at this frequency targets the mitochondria in skin cells, stimulating ATP production and accelerating the repair processes that declining estrogen disrupts. For menopausal skin - which is simultaneously dealing with collagen loss, barrier dysfunction, increased sensitivity, and hormonal acne, this combination of hands-on expertise and science-backed technology represents a meaningful advance over single-approach treatments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Early Response: Five Stars and a Waitlist</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Since its introduction, the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® has generated five-star reviews and consistent demand that has already produced a waitlist. InnoVitale Spa has more than 250 five-star Google reviews overall, and the facial has become one of its most talked-about treatments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The response reflects a broader market reality. A 2024 Bonafide survey of more than 2,000 women found that 94% of US women reported receiving no education about menopause in school, and nearly half said they did not feel informed about it at all. More than 3 in 5 women said they are more likely to purchase from a brand that invests in menopause-related solutions. The Meno \"Pause\" Facial® is positioned squarely at the intersection of that unmet need and a growing willingness to seek out specialized care.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">St. Petersburg and Tampa Bay area women navigating perimenopause or menopause can now book the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® directly at <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=1698881455&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.innovitalespa.com%2Ffacials-v2%2F&amp;a=InnoVitale+Spa\" tabindex=\"0\">InnoVitale Spa</a> .

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Fabio Natalucci </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Private credit is easy to enter but hard to exit. Retail investors seeking fast cash could trigger a financial crisis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A spiral of illiquidity, forced selling, markdowns and deleveraging could emerge. Sound familiar? It happened with securitization markets during the 2007-08 financial crisis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The recent selloff of Blue Owl Capital's (OWL) stock after a redemption at one of its retail private-credit funds has become the poster child for increasing anxiety about the health of the private-credit market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Private credit has grown rapidly in recent years - approaching $2 trillion - and it has never been tested through a full recession or financial-market stress without the backstop of the U.S. Federal Reserve. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fault line exposed now is that private credit is being offered to retail investors and wealthy individuals whose liquidity preferences are different from sophisticated, more patient institutional investors. These new investors line up to get their money back, effectively forcing sales of illiquid assets, as in the case of Blue Owl, at a time when entire segments of financial markets are getting repriced based on investor estimates of how artificial intelligence will disrupt the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Blue Owl hit a 52-week low earlier this month, as did shares of Blackstone (BX). Other major firms including Carlyle Group (CG), KKR (KKR), Apollo Global Management (APO) and Ares Management (ARES) were also caught in the selloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It is worth noting that vulnerabilities in private credit are increasing at a time when economic growth is still strong and financial conditions are very accommodative, while the credit cycle is still benign. The answer to whether the stress in this nearly $2 trillion market can turn into something more systemic, like the 2008 global financial crisis, lies in its structure and interconnectedness. Let's take a look. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Liquidity risk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Liquidity risk has historically been limited in private credit. Pension funds and insurance companies have long investing time horizons and understand that illiquid assets are the source of the higher yield or \"illiquidity premium\" they earn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the industry is expanding aggressively into retail, private wealth and 401(k)s through offerings like interval funds, business development companies (BDCs) and integrated technology platforms. Retail investors generally have shorter horizons and stronger liquidity preferences. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Blue Owl episode highlights the friction that can emerge when periodic, albeit limited, liquidity is promised against fundamentally illiquid underlying assets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To provide cash to investors in its OBDC II fund, Blue Owl said it sold $1.4 billion of senior secured credit from 27 industries across three of its funds. Four pension funds and insurance companies were among the buyers at an average price close to par, and it was later reported that one of the buyers was an insurance asset manager it owns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saba Capital and Cox Capital Partners announced their intention to launch tender offers to purchase shares in three Blue Owl BDCs, with offer price reportedly at a 20% to 35% discount to estimated NAVs - a significant haicut for investors in those vehicles to access immediate liquidity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Leverage: Layered and opaque </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Leverage in the private-credit ecosystem, while limited relative to institutions like banks, exists in complex and opaque layers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The companies doing the borrowing are leveraged. There also is leverage at the fund level - through subscription lines or capital-call facilities, net-asset-value lending and BDC structures. There is potentially leverage at the investor level through the use of derivatives and other mechanisms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This layering makes it difficult for investors and regulators to assess overall financial leverage in the system. More importantly, it complicates understanding how these layers may interact in stress - especially when combined with illiquid assets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Interconnectedness: Strength or vulnerability? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Distributing risk enhances financial stability. But under stress, this interconnectedness could rapidly transmit shocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In principle, distributing risk across diverse investors with different horizons and risk appetites enhances financial stability. But under stress, this interconnectedness could rapidly transmit shocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, insurance companies play a central role in channeling funding into private-credit markets, and some are owned by private-credit managers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Imagine a situation where, amid rising strains in credit markets, an insurance company needing liquidity but unable to retrieve capital from illiquid investments is forced to sell other more liquid assets, like equities or investment-grade bonds. Correlations across asset classes could rise abruptly, propagating the initial stress like a wave across segments of the financial system seemingly uncorrelated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Credit quality: Calm on the surface </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Private-credit funds appear to have diversified exposures across industries. Yet the broader economy is increasingly exposed to what amounts to a massive macro bet on AI. Investors have aggressively repriced sectors perceived as losers from AI disruption - software, data analytics, tax strategies, cybersecurity and, most recently, delivery and payments. Blue Owl said about 13% of the credit sold represented the internet software and services industries. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other developments should give investors pause: increased use of payment-in-kind (PIK) interest and the growing use of continuation funds to generate secondary liquidity. These tools can smooth short-term pressures, but they may mask underlying fragilities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Private-credit markets remain opaque. Prices of loans can vary widely across funds holding similar assets. Secondary liquidity and price discovery are limited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This opacity matters most for retail investors, who have more immediate liquidity needs and rely more on timely and trustworthy pricing to assess risk. But it also matters for insurance companies, which depend heavily on ratings in determining capital treatment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If trust in marks, ratings or valuations were to evaporate, the lack of transparent price discovery could lead to a sudden rush for liquidity by retail investors that would amplify stress. Once credit assets are sold at a discount in secondary markets, that price becomes an actual mark for the entire industry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A spiral of illiquidity, forced selling, markdowns and deleveraging could emerge - amplified by opacity and rapidly fading trust. Sound familiar? It happened with securitization markets during the 2007-08 financial crisis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Hedge funds offer locked-up private credit investors a way out - at a hefty discount </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Such a crisis is a tail risk for now, and possible knock-on effects from the Blue Owl episode seem limited at the moment. But while private credit may not necessarily be the source of systemic stress, it may become an important conduit for it, given its high degree of interconnectedness - particularly in the event of a sharp slowdown of the economy. Investors and policymakers should ask themselves whether the push into the retail space may turn out to be private credit's Achilles' heel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fabio Natalucci is CEO of the Andersen Institute for Finance &amp; Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: 'I'm shocked that people are shocked,' says JPMorgan executive about private-credit meltdown </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Plus: This fund that now says it'll never open up for withdrawals has El-Erian making Bear Stearns parallels </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Fabio Natalucci </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
