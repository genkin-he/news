With 42% margins, you'd expect a richer valuation, but Waystar trades at about seven-times sales - a far cry from bubble territory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Next, look at the enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) leaders where AI genuinely enhances products, rather than cannibalizing core businesses: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Atlassian (TEAM): Atlassian's growth remains solid - fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.38 billion - and the company is leaning into AI as a core pillar. Its centerpiece is Atlassian Rovo, an AI \"teammate\" introduced in May 2024 that layers search, chat and AI agents across Jira, Confluence and other tools to help teams find information, summarize work and automate workflows. With a base of more than 300,000 customers, deeply embedded products (Jira, Confluence) and a potent AI layer, Atlassian is one of the purer enterprise SaaS AI plays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DocuSign (DOCU): Shares of DocuSign tumbled at the end of September after headlines framed OpenAI's new \"DocuGPT\" as a competitive threat. In reality, DocuGPT was presented as an internal OpenAI agent that converts contracts into structured, searchable data - not an e-signature platform or commercial DocuSign replacement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff overlooked DocuSign's real strength: its entrenched legal-compliance infrastructure, enterprise integrations and a growing Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform that uses AI to analyze and manage contracts end to end. These capabilities are deeply embedded across regulated industries and supported by the company's roughly $900 million in annual free cash flow, allowing continued investment and share repurchases. With AI enhancing - not replacing - its core workflow moat, DocuSign remains one of the most undervalued enterprise automation plays amid AI-driven market confusion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adobe (ADBE): Adobe reported $6 billion in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up roughly 11% year over year, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.31. The company also noted that its AI-influenced annual recurring revenue surpassed $5 billion, and its generative-AI-model family (Adobe Firefly) has already produced more than 24 billion pieces of content. Despite this, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 - well below its historical 10-year average of 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The thesis is brutally simple: These companies boast loyal users, documented time- and cost-savings tools, and deep integration that customers keep paying for regardless of headline volatility. They aren't betting on the farm on AI; they're using it to widen existing competitive moats and improve unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your bubble-management playbook </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The timeline for maximum disruption in AI runs from the beginning of 2026 until the third quarter of 2027. This is the point when both the AI pilot launches that haven't produced a return on investment and the 2021-2023 AI startups run out of capital. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports that 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024, with the average organization scrapping 46% of AI proof of concepts before production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates the framework for a slow-motion AI-bubble deflation, rather than a catastrophic burst: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 1 hyperscalers with diversified revenue will weather disappointing AI returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 2 unicorns face valuation compression or acquisition. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 3 experiences mass casualties, with a small cohort of survivors demonstrating actual unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three plays outlined above position investors for this selective deflation: buying Tier 1 quality on 15% to 20% corrections; positioning in data-center infrastructure ahead of verified 2027 constraints; and accumulating profitable companies - whether routine automation or mispriced SaaS - being unfairly sold off alongside failing startups. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI bubble is deflating on schedule - but the infrastructure buildout and automation revolution remain genuine opportunities for investors who can distinguish between speculative AI startups burning cash and profitable enterprises solving real problems with measurable returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: These stocks are the real deal for investors in AI - Wall Street is just chasing bubbles </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Everyone's asking the wrong question about an AI bubble. Here are the stocks to buy - and when. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I've been watching the AI bubble inflate for months now - the unsustainable burn rates, the pilot projects that went nowhere, the startups that couldn't explain their unit economics. So when industry insiders finally started ringing alarm bells, I couldn't resist diving deeper into what's really happening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What I found surprised me. Yes, there's an AI bubble. But the viral claim that it's 17-times larger than the dot-com crash is misleading. MacroStrategy Partnership's headline-grabbing analysis measured total capital misallocation across all asset classes, not AI specifically. It seems to me that the math behind the analysis was designed to terrify, not inform. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More importantly, everyone's asking the wrong question. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The debate shouldn't be whether the AI bubble will pop - that's already happening. Not in some dramatic, market-crushing way that will dominate headlines, but through a slow-motion deflation that's quietly reshaping the entire landscape. The casualties are already piling up: startup shutdowns surged in 2024; in 2025, 95% of enterprise AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact within six months of launch; and down rounds this year hit a decade high at 15.9% of all venture deals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many companies that scream the loudest about the bubble are either exaggerating the threat or fundamentally misunderstanding what's actually unfolding. This isn't the 2000 dot-com collapse all over again. It's far more interesting and far more profitable if you know where to look. I've identified three distinct market tiers facing radically different fates: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 1: The hyperscalers (Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)) are essentially unassailable. Their estimated $320 billion to $340 billion in 2025 capex spending - largely for AI and cloud infrastructure - comes from operating cash flow generated by their core businesses. They can weather extended periods of disappointing AI returns because their core businesses print money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 2: The unicorns in limbo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI) command massive valuations but face existential questions. Can they achieve returns that justify stratospheric valuations? Can they compete against both hyperscalers with infinite resources and substantially cheaper models coming in from overseas? The next 18 to 24 months will separate the winners and losers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 3: Mass casualties are showing up in the numbers. We're seeing more shutdowns (up 26% year over year in 2024), decade-high down rounds in 2025, thinner deal counts and smaller checks, plus enterprises scrapping a big chunk of AI work and failing to get a return on investment (ROI) from pilots. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Expectations are being managed to engineer an orderly deflation rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Sam Altman openly admits that investors as a whole are overexcited about AI at the same time his OpenAI reaches a valuation of $500 billion, he's not confessing failure - he's managing expectations to engineer an orderly deflation, rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates a rare market asymmetry: The public sees \"bubble\" and flees everything AI-related, while sophisticated capital is making precise bets on deflation survivors. Here are three investment strategies to put you on the winning side of any correction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     1. Buy Tier 1 hyperscalers after the 15% to 20% correction </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When the next correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft: Microsoft's AI business is already at a $13 billion annual run rate, up 175% year over year, but most of its money still comes from core products including Azure, Office and Windows. With about $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Microsoft can easily fund its AI buildout without stretching its balance sheet. A pullback in the stock to $400 to $420 would bring the valuation back to around 30-times earnings - right at historical norms and a strong long-term entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon.com: Amazon's cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing about 17.5% year over year, hitting a $123 billion annual run rate. The bulk of Amazon's revenue still comes from retail and e-commerce, giving the company the cash flow and scale to invest heavily in AI infrastructure without jeopardizing its core business. If the shares pulled back 15%, the valuation would drop into the 27- to 30-times-earnings range, offering a potentially compelling entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet: Internet-search advertising still accounts for roughly 56% of revenue, and for the second quarter of 2025, the company posted an operating margin of 32.4%. Estimated capital expenditures for 2025 are roughly $85?billion, much of which is going into AI and data-center infrastructure, yet Alphabet maintains a strong balance sheet to absorb variable returns. A correction of 15% to 20% would lower the valuation to about 22- to 23-times earnings, potentially offering the best entry within the hyperscaler group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DeepSeek's January 2025 reveal triggered a brief panic across AI stocks; hyperscalers slipped 2% to 5%, while AI chip and infrastructure names plunged 15% to 30% before rebounding within days. The takeaway for investors is clear: When the next 15% to 20% correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee - the long-term infrastructure buildout remains intact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Believe the hype: AI is coming for your job. Plan now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     2. Invest in data centers before power constraints are a given </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gartner's November 2024 forecast warns that 40% of AI data centers could face power-availability constraints by 2027, underscoring the physical limits of AI expansion. The firm projects that AI computing workloads alone could consume around 500 terawatt-hours of electricity annually by 2027 - more than two-and-a-half times the 195 TWh used in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dominion Energy (D) is ground zero for the AI power crunch. In Virginia - the world's most populous area for data centers - data-center capacity demand has nearly doubled in just five months, jumping from 21 gigawatts under contract to more than 40. These servers already consume a quarter of the state's electricity, and Dominion expects demand to double again by 2039. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To keep up, Dominion is spending $50 billion over the next five years on new electric-transmission projects and infrastructure upgrades -including an offshore wind project, a solar and battery storage project, and five small modular reactors planned for the 2030s. The stock throws off a 4% to 5% dividend yield, but what really matters is positioning: Dominion isn't just a utility anymore - it's becoming the backbone of the AI era's grid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vistra (VST): Vistra signed a 20-year deal to supply 1,200 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power from its Comanche Peak facility to an investment-grade buyer. It's also adding 860 MW of new gas capacity at its Permian Basin site (boosting it to 1,185 MW) and has outlined up to 2,000 MW of Texas gas additions by 2028 to meet surging data-center and industrial load. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition, data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Digital Realty Trust (DLR): Operates more than 300 data centers globally and has a long record of annual dividend increases. The stock's current dividend yield runs close to 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equinix (EQIX) operates more than 270 data centers serving in excess of 10,000 customers. Last year, the company marked 85 consecutive quarters of top-line growth and said announced projects were more than 85% leased and preleased as of the first quarter of 2025, underscoring demand from hyperscalers and large enterprises. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vertiv (VRT): Nvidia (NVDA) last year partnered with Vertiv for AI data-center builds, and Vertiv's stock has soared. The company's valuation is high, but the stock is riding a market that Goldman Sachs sees jumping to $10.6 billion next year, from $4.1 billion in 2023, as liquid cooling reaches 57% of AI servers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Schneider Electric (FR:SU) (SBGSY): This French multinational is a steadier way to play the data-center theme, with a 24% exposure to data-center end markets and 25% fourth-quarter growth in North American energy management on surging AI demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Conservative investors should build positions in companies poised to profit from the coming power crunch. As AI data centers push grid capacity to its limits, these firms stand to benefit from the multiyear investment cycle required to expand power generation, cooling and infrastructure. With the 2027 constraint window approaching, the next year offers a favorable entry period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     3. Buy what the market has mispriced </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The stock market is committing a cardinal error: indiscriminately punishing profitable companies with documented ROI along with speculative AI startups with no path to profitability. This creates two distinct opportunities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, look at companies that solve unglamorous back-office problems through automation. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UiPath (PATH): UiPath boasts 83% gross margins and its solid client base includes giants such as Orange Spain (FR:ORA) (ORANY) and Travis Perkins (UK:TPK) (TPRKY), yet the stock trades at about four-times sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BlackLine (BL): Third-party studies show triple-digit ROI from BlackLine's close automation - 234% ROI at Creditsafe (12.4-month payback) and 379% ROI at Red Wing (Nucleus Research). BlackLine returned to GAAP profitability in 2024 and authorized a $200 million share repurchase (later increased by another $200 million). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  10-31-25 0731ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make the December quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm.

Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
