            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Lawrence G. McMillan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stay the course, but be cautious </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 index SPX gapped higher two days in a row this week - a show of strength. (Those gaps are marked with circles on the upper right of the SPX chart below.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's support now for SPX at the old highs - near 6,750 - in addition to the well-tested support at 6,500 to 6,550. Those support levels are marked with red horizontal lines on the SPX chart. It is possible that a pullback toward support at 6,750 could take place - SPX shed 1% on Thursday - but it would not be a game changer if it did. This market seems to be strong enough that it may not need such a pullback to \"refuel.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mind the gaps </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, about those S&amp;P 500 chart gaps: Some analysts believe most gaps need to be filled, and so a pullback toward support at 6,750 would do that. (Conversely, there are some obvious gaps that never get filled; witness the one back in April, also circled on the below chart.) What is almost comical, though, is the interpretations of two breakout gaps to new highs. Some view that as a sign of strength; to others, it's a sign of exhaustion. Frankly, you can probably prove whatever you want to as far as gaps are concerned. What is the important thing now is the 6,750 support level. If that is broken, it will be a large negative, and if support at 6,500 were broken, sellers would surely flood in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite the market's strength and the positive nature of the SPX chart, some indicators are showing weakness. So far, they have had little to no effect, but market tops can be \"rounding\" affairs with an accumulation of sell signals before a break occurs - as opposed to market bottoms, which can be sudden and V-shaped, such as the one back in April. To that end, SPX has not risen far enough to reach the +4&lt;SIGMA&gt; \"modified Bollinger band,\" so the McMillan volatility band (MVB) sell signal is still in place. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The equity-only put-call ratios curled upward and began to rise a little more than a week ago. That is normally a sell signal for the broad stock market, especially when these signals come from such a low level on their chart. But these sell signals have not been borne out with lower SPX prices, and now the put-call ratios are turning lower again. The computer programs we use to analyze these ratio charts continue to \"say\" that sell signals are in effect, but the look of it raises questions - marked by the question marks on the charts below. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another internal indicator - market breadth - has been struggling to stay positive, and certainly it is not as optimistic as the SPX chart. On the breakout itself by SPX, breadth was positive for a few days, and that was encouraging. However, over the past two days, breadth has weakened considerably, and the NYSE-based breadth oscillator is back to a sell signal, while the \"stocks only\" breadth oscillator is teetering on the brink of a new sell signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market breadth I am referring to here is the \"traditional\" breadth: the daily number of advancing issues minus the number of declining issues. Another type of breadth has been much more positive and in tune with the market: cumulative volume breadth (CVB), the daily accumulated total of volume on advancing stocks minus volume on declining stocks. CVB has been hitting all-time highs with some regularity, just like SPX. This past week, CVB made an all-time high on Oct. 24 and Oct. 27. This is strong confirmation of the new highs being made by SPX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Realized volatility, in the form of the 20-day historical volatility of SPX (HV20), has remained elevated ever since the market's last \"tariff tantrum\" on Oct. 10. This is a negative for stocks, too, in that a rise in volatility is generally not good for stock prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Implied volatility VIX had its moment, exploding to 29 in the first half of October. As dire as that seemed to be - and has been in the past - it amounted to nothing this time. VIX is back to about 17 now, almost as if nothing had happened. As a result, there are two buy signals in effect for the broad stock market: the \"spike peak\" buy signal (green \"B\" on the accompanying VIX chart) and the trend of VIX buy signal (pink \"B\" on the chart). As long as VIX remains below its 200-day moving average (currently just above 19), these buy signals will remain in effect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The construct of volatility derivatives is back to a fully bullish position for stocks as well. The term structures of both the VIX futures and of the Cboe volatility indices continue to slope upwards. Moreover, there is a relatively large premium on the VIX futures once again. So, despite the negativity associated with an inversion in the term structure during the week of Oct. 17, the market has recovered. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We remain overall bullish, in line with the SPX chart, but will continue to trade all confirmed signals when they appear. Continue to roll deeply in-the-money positions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earnings spotlight </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several important earnings reports are due next week, and while it's too early to price the straddles, one can observe the median move over the past 10 earnings reports: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir Technologies( PLTR): 17.8% of the stock price. If the straddle can be bought cheaper than that, there is an edge in favor of the straddle buy. (Earnings due Nov. 3 after the close of trading.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Uber Technologies (UBER): 5.7% of the stock price. (Earnings due Nov. 4 before the market opens.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Qualcomm (QCOM): 6.8% of the stock price. (Earnings due Nov. 5 after the close.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DraftKings (DKNG): 4.4% of the stock price (Earnings due Nov. 6 after the close.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New recommendation: ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When the premium is large on the VIX futures, the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF SVXY rises in value. The reason is that this ETF is short the actual VIX futures. When there is a large premium on those futures, there is \"time decay\" as time passes, and the futures lose value, all else being equal. Of course, a rising VIX would cause SVXY to fall in value even if the futures retained a premium. Generally, though, when the futures premium is large, it can be beneficial to own SVXY or buy calls on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buy 4 SVXY (Nov. 21) 50 calls in line with the market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We compute a weighted futures premium composite, and we call that calculation VOLFUTA. It currently stands at 2.30. This trade would be stopped out if it were to fall to 0.50 or less. We will update its value weekly in this report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New recommendation: Whirlpool (WHR) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a new weighted put-call-ratio buy signal in Whirlpool (WHR). The company reported earnings this week and the stock enjoyed a brief rally, which has mostly dissipated. Regardless, the previous put-call-ratio buy signal from a roughly equivalent level last June worked out well, so we are recommending this one now - although we are putting a condition on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If WHR closes above 75, then buy 2 WHR (Dec. 19) 75 calls in line with the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Follow-up action: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We are using a standard rolling procedure for our SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) SPY spreads: In any vertical bull or bear spread, if the underlying hits the short strike, then roll the entire spread. That would be roll up in the case of a call bull spread or roll down in the case of a bear put spread. Stay in the same expiration and keep the distance between the strikes the same unless otherwise instructed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, for outright long options, roll if they become 8 points in-the-money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 APH (APH) (Nov. 21) 130 calls: The stock is making new highs. Raise the trailing closing stop for APH to 128 for these calls. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 TSEM (TSEM) (Nov. 17) 75 call and short 1 TSEM (Nov. 21) 85 call: Raise the trailing, closing stop to 72 for this TSEM spread. Roll the entire spread up 10 points if TSEM trades at 85. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long expiring 1 SPY (Oct. 31) 687 call and sell 1 SPY (Oct. 31) 702 call: The spread was rolled up when SPY traded at 687 on Oct. 28. Now, roll to the following: Buy 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 685 call and sell 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 705 call. We will hold until new lows outnumber new highs on two consecutive days on the NYSE. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 4 ATAI (ATAI) (Nov. 21) 6 calls: Use a trailing closing stop at 5.20 for these calls. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 NKE (NKE) (Nov. 21) 72.5 puts: We will hold these as long as the weighted put-call ratio for NKE is on a sell signal. Roll down to the NKE (Nov. 21) 65 puts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 665 put and short 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 615 put: This is the position based on the MVB sell signal. Continue to hold until SPX trades at either of the +/-4&lt;SIGMA&gt; bands. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 BXP (BXP) (Jan. 16) 72.5 puts: We will hold this position as long as the weighted put-call ratio for BXP remains on a sell signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 400 BEEM (BEEM) common: Use a trailing, closing stop at 2.75 for this position. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 SPY (Nov. 28) 685 call and short 1 SPY (Nov. 28) 700 call: This is the position based on the most recent VIX \"spike peak\" buy signal. Stop out if VIX closes above 28.99 on any day. Otherwise, we will hold for 22 trading days. The original spread was rolled up when SPY traded at 685 on Oct. 28. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 BSX (BSX) (Dec. 19) 100 calls: We will hold these calls as long as the weighted put-call ratio for BSX remains on a buy signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Send questions to: lmcmillan@optionstrategist.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lawrence G.

For example, during an earnings call on July 26, 2024, in response to an analyst’s question about whether Avantor was losing share to a competitor, Defendant Michael Stubblefield, then the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, assured investors that Avantor’s “lab business stacks up well against every number that certainly that we’ve seen,” that “we continue to enhance our position,” and that “we’re really confident in our value proposition and our competitive position.” Likewise, Defendants repeatedly pointed to Avantor’s purported competitive advantages, such as its digital capabilities, as evidence that the Company would continue to enjoy strong competitive positioning.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nInvestors began to learn the truth about the effects of increased competition on Avantor’s business on April 25, 2025, when the Company reported disappointing first quarter 2025 financial results, cut its guidance for 2025, and announced that Defendant Stubblefield would be stepping down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer. Defendants attributed Avantor’s weak performance and outlook to “the impact of increased competitive intensity.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOn this news, the price of Avantor common stock declined $2.57 per share, or more than 16.5%, from a close of $15.50 per share on April 24, 2025, to close at $12.93 per share on April 25, 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThen, on August 1, 2025, the Company reported disappointing second quarter 2025 financial results, including a year-over-year decrease in net sales, and further reduced the Company’s 2025 guidance—now projecting organic revenue growth of -2% to 0%. Defendants again attributed Avantor’s poor results and outlook to “increased competitive intensity,” and further admitted that the Company did not expect the competitive environment to materially improve in the remainder of 2025 and weak performance would therefore likely persist.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIn response to this news, the price of Avantor common stock declined $2.08 per share, or more than 15%, from a close of $13.44 per share on July 31, 2025, to close at $11.36 per share on August 1, 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThen, on October 29, 2025, the Company reported weak third quarter 2025 financial results, including -5% organic revenue growth (below the guidance Defendants had provided in August), and a net loss of $712 million, which Defendants primarily attributed to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $785 million.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Felix Vezina-Poirier </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weakening economy makes the central bank's December interest-rate decision clearer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation is on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's radar, but isn't the central bank's biggest concern right now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The slowdown in job creation since January suggests the economy is not running as hot as growth estimates imply. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prior to the U.S. government shutdown, the divergence between resilient growth and a slowing labor market became striking. Now, as the shutdown halts the publication of key government statistics, investors are flying partially blind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But even without fresh official numbers, the latest evidence suggests that U.S. growth estimates are too strong. The divide between reported GDP and weak employment will likely be reconciled by slower growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That divergence matters. Whether growth catches down with employment or employment rebounds will determine the path of monetary policy. For the Federal Reserve, a weakening economy argues for further caution. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Macroeconomists face their own version of the chicken-and-egg problem: Is spending driving employment, or is employment driving spending? Normally, it doesn't matter much; the two move together. Spending fuels hiring and income, and income sustains spending in a circular loop. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This year, however, the link has broken. Even before the shutdown, the data showed a split between solid GDP estimates and a stalled labor market. That gap is unlikely to persist. Growth will almost certainly be revised lower, for two reasons. First, growth estimates are often subject to substantial revision. Second, leading indicators already point to softer momentum ahead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Assessing growth </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Think of the economy as a machine. Every machine has a capacity, and how hard it runs relative to that capacity determines its temperature. When the economy runs above capacity, it overheats; wages and prices rise. When it runs too cold, growth, wages and inflation fall, as they often do in recessions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model currently estimates third-quarter growth at 3.9%, about twice the pace the U.S. economy can sustain without overheating. If growth were truly that strong, we would expect employment to accelerate, not stall. The slowdown in job creation since January suggests the economy is not running as hot as growth estimates imply. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The government shutdown complicates this picture by disrupting the release of \"hard data\" (direct measures of activity such as employment, spending, production, construction, etc.) typically published by federal agencies. But \"soft data,\" such as business and consumer surveys, remain available. Combined, they give a reasonable view of where the economy stands. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BCA's U.S. growth diffusion index, which aggregates 89 hard and soft indicators and has historically led turning points in GDP, shows growth decelerating below potential. Specifically, the index's hard-data component peaked in April and has slowed ever since. The signal remains the same even when labor variables are excluded. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, the soft data remain subdued. Business surveys consistently cite uncertainty, especially around tariffs, as a key drag on confidence. Although trade deals have been announced, their frequent revisions and the unpredictability of tariff policy continue to weigh on manufacturers and service providers alike. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation and the Fed </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed cut its policy rate by another 25 basis points on Wednesday but signaled that a cut at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. A key input for whether the central bank cuts again or not hinges on how the growth - employment divide will resolve. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation remains on investors' radar, but for the Fed it has become a secondary concern. Tariffs, not domestic demand, are the main source of upward price pressure. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You might notice that inflation has not been mentioned. That's deliberate. Inflation remains on investors' radar, but for the Fed it has become a secondary concern. Tariffs, not domestic demand, are the main source of price pressures. Monetary policy cannot address that, and tariff-driven inflation is not broadening thus far. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Central bankers view inflation through three lenses: demand, supply and expectations. The demand side has weakened as the labor market stalled. The supply side remains pressured by tariffs but not in a self-reinforcing way as fiscal and monetary conditions are not stimulating demand as they did in 2020 and 2021, when the last supply shock hit the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market-based inflation expectations remain well-anchored near the Fed's 2% target. CPI swaps, which reflect investors' inflation outlook, show a temporary \"tariff bump\" over the next year, with one-year swaps near 2.9%. But one-year, one-year forward swaps, which measure expectations for a year starting from now, are at the Fed's inflation target. The same pattern holds in longer-term gauges such as the five-year, five-year forward CPI swap. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Together, these factors paint a picture of softening growth and fading inflationary pressures outside of tariffs, a mix that supports additional easing as the labor market sits uncomfortably close to a tipping point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investment implications </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Our stance remains neutral on equities, overweight on government bonds and underweight on cash as well as both investment-grade and high-yield credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This macro backdrop leaves markets in an uneasy equilibrium. Growth is slowing; inflation is contained; and the Fed is easing, but not urgently. Our stance remains neutral on equities, overweight on government bonds and underweight on cash, as well as both investment-grade and high-yield credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Need to Know: Why junk bonds could lower risks in your investment portfolio and even boost returns </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At such tight spreads, credit offers a poor reward-to-risk ratio regardless of whether the economy slows or reaccelerates. Equities, by contrast, still have pockets of structural upside thanks to AI and productivity themes that are not directly tied to the business cycle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For investors, the key is flexibility. If economic growth and momentum deteriorate markedly, underweight stocks. If inflation reaccelerates, underweight both stocks and bonds and shift toward cash and inflation hedges such as commodities. But if the economy slows just enough for monetary policy to save the expansion, current positioning should hold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Felix Vezina-Poirier is the chief strategist for Daily Insights, BCA Research's global cross-asset strategy service.

This week also marks the first missed paycheck for the nation's air-traffic controllers, while Transportation Security Administration employees, including airport screeners, are also going without pay. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That increases the risk of further flight cancellations mere weeks away from the air-travel Super Bowl: Thanksgiving week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If we are still going [with the shutdown] by Thanksgiving, it'll be a disaster in the air\" in terms of delays, said Ernest Arvai, president of AirInsight Group, who noted that Thanksgiving also usually brings weather delays on top of the crowds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vice President JD Vance echoed that sentiment later on Thursday after a meeting with U.S. airline executives. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By Thanksgiving, air-traffic controllers and other essential government workers would be missing four paychecks, which could lead to missed work and \"massive delays,\" Vance said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) issued statements later Thursday urging lawmakers to end the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Roughly 14,000 air-traffic controllers and some 60,000 TSA agents are considered essential workers, and are thus expected to continue working during the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They may increasingly be calling out of work, however. \"Staffing triggers,\" indicating a shortage of controllers, have been driving some flight cancellations and delays in recent days, in addition to the more usual halts triggered by bad weather or construction at major airports this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Staffing triggers are expected to increase throughout the rest of the week as paychecks remain held up, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, on its website, urges air-traffic controllers to \"rise to the occasion.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our union or our professions,\" the union said on its webpage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AirInsight's Arvai said air-traffic controllers have done a great public service during the shutdown. \"But all it takes is a couple of guys being out\" for delays, as the system is already operating under long-running shortages, he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It takes three to five years of experience for an air-traffic controller to work in high-density areas. Only about a third of the people vying to become a controller complete training, and of those, \"the stress gets to about half\" in their first few months on the job, Arvai said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"To get one controller, you probably have had to train five. It's not a job for everybody, let me put it that way,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In several interviews this week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned of even more air-travel disruption as the shutdown grinds on. Duffy said at an event that \"this year, on average, the delays that are associated with staffing triggers, with air-traffic controllers, is 5%,\" but that they were 44% on Sunday and 24% on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So far in 2025, which is considered a normal year, around 20% of flights have been delayed for a variety of reasons, aviation analytics company Cirium said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Major travel groups have yet to issue their predictions for Thanksgiving-week travel, which broke records last year. Travel and leisure group AAA said last year that nearly 6 million people were expected to fly during the holiday week, or 2% more than the previous year. Executives at major U.S. airlines recently expressed optimism about holiday travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If travelers feel the shutdown pain at airports, airlines feel it on their operations beyond the cancellations and delays. Among personnel furloughed are aviation-safety professionals, including aircraft-certification engineers and aerospace engineers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown also threatens to halt the progress U.S. airlines have seen in getting planes in and out of airports on time. Before the shutdown, U.S. delays and cancellations were trending down this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown started Oct. 1 mostly because President Donald Trump and Republicans are in a standoff with Democratic lawmakers over including an extension for Obamacare subsidies in a bill that funds the federal government through Nov. 21. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite several well-publicized problems in the spring, including a deadly air crash in Washington, D.C., and long delays at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, 2025 had been essentially tied with last year as far as the number of flights canceled or delayed for more than 15 minutes, the industry's on-time marker. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Rich fliers are making United and Delta billions by buying premium perks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Robert Schroeder in Washington contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(SICO) (Switzerland) remain unchanged following its announced acquisition of the IQUW group. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. These ratings apply to the members of Starr International Group (SIG) (New York, NY) and Starr Insurance &amp; Reinsurance Limited (SIRL) (Bermuda), collectively referred to as Starr. (See below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.)\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nStarr announced on Oct. 29, 2025, that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the IQUW group. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. This acquisition expands Starr’s presence in the London wholesale market and bolsters its international business unit. While the final financial figures will be determined prior to close, AM Best has reviewed prospective financials and determined that Starr has ample liquidity and financial flexibility to support the transaction without impairing its balance sheet strength. Additionally, IQUW has been a strong performer in the past, which could aid Starr in future rating cycles, as synergies and scale are recognized within the greater group. AM Best will continue to monitor the transaction and respond if any of the initial indications change materially.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a+” (Excellent) remain unchanged with stable outlooks for the following members of SIG:\n\n</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nStarr Indemnity &amp; Liability Company\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nStarr Surplus Lines Insurance Company\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nStarr Specialty Insurance Company\n\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a+” (Excellent) remain unchanged with stable outlooks for the following members of SIRL:\n\n</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nStarr Property &amp; Casualty Insurance (China) Company, Limited\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nStarr International Insurance (Asia) Limited\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nStarr International Insurance (Singapore) Pte.
