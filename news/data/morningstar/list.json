Utilizing end-to-end edge computing technology, Toshiba's solution also minimizes the risk of shrink, builds shopper trust, and enhances checkout speed for a seamless and enjoyable self-service experience.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe 27 locations participating in the pilot are already generating measurable benefits in customer satisfaction and store productivity. Stores are reporting a 50% - 70% increase in self-checkout transactions. A defining feature of ELERA® Security Suite that is critical for the retailer includes accurately recognizing over 700 unique produce codes and a wide assortment of fresh produce. The solution is also reducing staff self-checkout intervention rates from 50% to about 10%—20%. By spending less time at self-checkout, employees are empowered to focus on higher-value responsibilities around the store.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“The self-checkout improvements provided by Toshiba and ELERA® Security Suite are especially significant on high-traffic days when produce promotions attract more shoppers. My team and I can provide better customer service when we can work efficiently and with less stress during peak hours,” said Adriana Correa, Store Manager at Hipermarket El Dorado, a chain under Group El Rosado. “When fewer team members are at self-checkout, our staff can focus on other operational tasks and increase overall productivity across the store.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWith the rollout completed in less than four months, the rapid successful pilot implementation is a testament to the strong collaboration between Grupo El Rosado, Toshiba, and valued partners. <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compuhelp.com.ec%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=COMPUHELP&amp;index=5&amp;md5=89993f28afd40b7a9d421495b611cb16\" tabindex=\"0\">COMPUHELP</a> performed the installation, and systems integrator <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F33sur.cl%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=33%26%23176%3B+Sur&amp;index=6&amp;md5=fe0ddf1a73599fff108b002e7ad77f17\" tabindex=\"0\">33° Sur</a> was responsible for the seamless implementation. Throughout the project, the partner companies stayed in close collaboration and had ongoing system validations to keep the project on schedule and fine-tune produce recognition performance. This high level of coordination between the partners enabled the team to deliver a robust solution in time for the stores’ peak produce season.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Grupo El Rosado’s success with the ELERA® Security Suite reflects Toshiba’s commitment to innovation and our role as a trusted technology partner. By combining AI, computer vision, and edge computing, we’re enabling Grupo El Rosado to reimagine self-checkout to drive measurable improvements in customer experiences, shrink, and store operations,” said Manuel Medecigo VP Sales LATAM at Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions. “This collaboration showcases the significant impact of close, strategic partnerships and Toshiba’s deep retail expertise.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe latest ELERA® Security Suite upgrade is among the many successful implementations between Grupo El Rosado and Toshiba. The partnership continues to evolve across the retailer’s multiple store chains going back to 2012 with a POS system modernization and then expanding to include self-checkout and ELERA® software in 2022.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About El Grupo Rosado:</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGrupo El Rosado is one of the most prominent companies in Ecuador, serving as a prime example of innovation and development in the country.

LeBlanc cited, for instance, talks last fall between Ottawa and Washington to ease tariffs on key sectors like steel, aluminum and automobiles, which President Trump later terminated due to anger over a Canadian ad that questioned the use of tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  LeBlanc said Canada wants the U.S. to recommit to a trilateral trade pact. Furthermore, he added, \"there have always been bilateral arrangements as between the three countries. That's not new… [And] we need to get a bilateral deal with the United States to take pressure off the sectoral tariffs.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The sectoral tariffs, of up to 50%, have squeezed Canada's manufacturing sector. Nonfarm payrolls data issued Thursday indicated that factories shed workers in December, for a year-over-year decline of 2.6%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  LeBlanc said he expects to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the coming days. Greer told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday that Canada will have to live with U.S. tariffs as part of a revised USMCA. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"If Canada wants to agree that we can have some level of higher tariff on them while they open up their markets to us on things like dairy and other things, then that's a helpful conversation,\" Greer said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Earlier this week, LeBlanc told Canadian senators he remained optimistic about USMCA's future, noting that the White House provided an exemption to a new U.S. tariff, of up to 15%, so long as the goods entering the U.S. comply with the trilateral pact. The Bank of Canada has labeled the pending review of USMCA as a key risk to the economic outlook. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 14:35 ET (19:35 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "title": "Musk, Altman and China are fighting to control a potential $320 billion market for brain implants",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's still very early days for brain chips that let people control devices with their thoughts - but the market opportunity has become increasingly intriguing to tech CEOs and politicians </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elon Musk's Neuralink is among the most visible brain-computer interface companies around. But OpenAI's Sam Altman and a growing number of Chinese startups are aiming to challenge its lead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elon Musk, Sam Altman and a growing number of rivals are all fighting to become the leading player in the nescient but potentially lucrative market for brain implants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the global market for brain-computer interface, or BCI, technology could be worth $80 billion by 2035. A decade after that, the market for BCIs in the U.S. alone could be valued at $320 billion, the bank said in a Wednesday note to investors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brain-computer interface systems aren't new. The first major testing of such technology came in the 1970s in California, although roots can be found decades earlier. In the late 1990s, neurologist Philip Kennedy developed the first BCI to allow a severely paralyzed patient to move a computer cursor using their brain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As BCI research has developed, so has the opportunity to make money off of the technology, though companies often emphasize the humanitarian benefits they can provide. According to data from Tracxn Technologies (IN:543638), which tracks private markets, there are 278 BCI companies around the world. Collectively, they've raised more than $4 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The most visible is Neuralink, the BCI startup founded by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk in 2016 that's reportedly worth $9 billion. Since January 2024, the startup has given its \"Telepathy\" implant to 21 patients with paralysis, allowing them to use phones, computers or robotic limbs with their thoughts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neuralink is also running a clinical trial for an implant designed to restore speech. Musk has said that, pending regulatory approval, Neuralink is ready for a trial of Blindsight, which could help restore patients' vision. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the end of the decade, Neuralink wants to implant its tech in a \"otherwise healthy\" person because the benefit outweighs the risk, President DJ Seo said last September. That could mean people would be able to pay for the ability to use their phones without physically doing anything. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In October, Neuralink submitted a scientific paper to the New England Journal of Medicine that described the first three patients implanted with one of its devices. It would be its first peer-reviewed publication with human data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The startup's approach includes placing electrodes near certain neurons after a protective layer around the brain and a piece of the patient's skull are removed. Then, Neuralink uses a robot to insert microscopic threads into the brain. After that, the implant is placed in the skull and skin is closed over it, according to the company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Competing with Neuralink is Synchron, a BCI company that has implanted 10 patients with devices designed to avoid open-brain surgery and recently raised $200 million. The firm has been backed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and was the first BCI company with connectivity to Apple (AAPL) devices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Pandromics, another competitor, implanted its BCI in a human for the first time last June. Its Connexus BCI is designed to restore communication for people with severe motor impairment as a result of spinal-cord injuries or ALS. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's also the new kid on the block. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Merge Labs exited stealth mode in mid-January with $252 million in funding from investors, including OpenAI. Altman, OpenAI's CEO, helped found Merge Labs, which aims to create widely accessible BCIs that are \"equal parts biology, device and AI.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Altman's role with Merge Labs set the stage for another rivalry in his long-standing feud with Musk, who helped found OpenAI but has soured on the company. Altman has also reportedly explored buying a rocket maker to compete with Musk's SpaceX. Musk, meanwhile, founded rival artificial-intelligence startup xAI and has taken OpenAI to court. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those U.S. tech big shots face increasing competition from overseas, particularly in China. According to Morgan Stanley, the Chinese government is expected to feature BCI technology prominently in its next five-year plan, set to be unveiled in March. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Inclusion in the plan would likely signal increased policy support, funding and commercialization pathways for BCI research and development over the next five years,\" analyst Adam Jonas said Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some of that support is already here. In December, China unveiled a 11.6 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) fund to support BCI companies. In August 2025, Chinese agencies revealed a plan to reach breakthroughs in \"core BCI technologies\" and build at least two globally competitive BCI firms over the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jonas noted that researchers at a Chinese university recently completed the first in-orbit test of a wireless BCI, collecting stable data under extreme conditions. China also has at least 20 BCI startups, 14 of which are funded, according to Tracxn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
