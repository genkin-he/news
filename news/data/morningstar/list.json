            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Christine Idzelis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors worry about Big Tech valuations being inflated relative to what they're actually worth, say strategist </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia and other Big Tech shares sold off Thursday, making it hard for the S&amp;P 500 to advance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia Corp. has the heft to make or break the U.S. stock market - and on Thursday the technology giant dragged down the S&amp;P 500. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite Nvidia's (NVDA) blowout earnings report Wednesday, shares of the artificial-intelligence chip maker had their worst day in months, and the selloff rippled across the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Information technology, the S&amp;P 500's largest sector, slumped 1.8% under the weight of Nvidia, with the company losing $259 billion in market value as the stock took its biggest dive since last April, according to Dow Jones Market Data. More broadly, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX fell 0.5% to snap back-to-back gains, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped a sharp 1.2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia is \"a big heavyweight\" in the S&amp;P 500 at around 8% of the index, so when it drops, it hurts the U.S. equities benchmark, according to Katie Stockton, a chartered market technician and founder of research firm Fairlead Strategies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's earnings results also didn't assuage the stock market's broader concerns about Big Tech's tremendous spending on artificial intelligence, with investors anxious about how much megacap companies are raising their capital-expenditure budgets on AI and the uncertainty about the return on that investment further down the road, according to Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech held back gains for the S&amp;P 500, making it difficult for the index to advance Thursday, even as other parts of the market broadly climbed, Gordon said in a phone interview. \"This is just how the index math haunts you.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can look across the board on solid results, but I think it's become the new normal in terms of this pushback on a lot of the spending on AI,\" said Gordon. Investors remain worried about whether Big Tech valuations are inflated relative to \"what they're actually worth,\" he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Nvidia is the biggest weight in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index NDX QQQ, with its massive market value having the heft to move the market and influence sentiment, Stockton at Fairlead Strategies said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors had run up Nvidia's stock in the lead-up to its highly anticipated earnings report released after the stock market's closing bell Wednesday, said Stockton. \"From a sentiment perspective,\" expectations on the part of investors were \"clearly quite high.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market sentiment surrounding AI and Big Tech soured Thursday, with shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) also seeing a sharp selloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Blips\" higher in the S&amp;P 500's tech sector XX:SP500.45 \"aren't being maintained,\" cautioned Stockton. \"If we lose market breadth\" and Big Tech stocks aren't there \"to pick up the slack,\" that would be \"problematic\" for the S&amp;P 500, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Nvidia \"delivered another stellar set of results that make the extraordinary seem ordinary,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note Wednesday. But \"given the material upward revisions in hyperscale capex expectations over the last five weeks, investor expectations were likely elevated coming into the print.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech selloff </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS - an exchange-traded fund that holds Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet, Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) - fell 1.6% on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Nvidia dropped 5.5%, snapping a four-day winning streak and leaving the company with a market value of $4.49 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That company was the worst performer in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, with Meta and Microsoft the only two stocks held by the fund that ended the day's trading in positive territory, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors on Thursday also were weighing earnings reports from software companies Salesforce (CRM) and Snowflake (SNOW), which both closed sharply higher Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The software sector broadly outperformed semiconductor stocks, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV gaining 2.2%, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX dropped 3%, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But an upbeat day for software stocks and other areas of the S&amp;P 500 weren't enough to offset the damage from Big Tech. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three sectors in which Big Tech resides, including information technology, communication services XX:SP500.50 and communication discretionary XX:SP500.25, make up 55% of the S&amp;P 500, said Gordon. That left the S&amp;P 500 down Thursday, even as the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP - which equally weighs stocks in the index - finished the day with a 0.6% gain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Christine Idzelis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Oman mediated the negotiations in Geneva. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Albusaidi offered no details on those negotiations, but said in his post that talks would resume after \"consultation in the respective capitals.\" He also said discussions on a \"technical level\" would take place next week in Vienna. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The White House didn't immediately respond to an emailed request from MarketWatch for details on the outcome of Thursday's negotiations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The news left oil prices slightly lower on Thursday, with April West Texas Intermediate crude (CLJ26) (CL.1) down 0.3% to settle at $65.21 a barrel, and April Brent crude (BRNJ26) at $70.75, down 0.1% for the session. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Geopolitics will drive the market in the short term, with prices rising and falling based on talks and then likely military actions,\" said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research. \"Only after there is a diplomatic or military resolution will fundamentals reassert themselves.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following Thursday's talks, \"there may only be one more chance for diplomacy to avoid a military confrontation next week,\" Gertken told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If Iran is not willing to renounce all uranium enrichment on its soil permanently, then the U.S. will likely take another round of military action against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\" he said. Last June, during the Israel-Iran war, the U.S. military attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gertken suggested that the March 2-6 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and potential secret talks in the aftermath, may be the last opportunity for Iran to \"capitulate prior to the U.S. taking military action.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump has said that U.S. military has amassed an armada of warships and fighter jets near Iran. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil may see active buying until Trump's deadline of March 6, said Gertken.

The goal of this program was to target unsampled intervals above and below historical assay intervals that report high-grade zones. Sampling of the historical drill core is expected to allow the Company to evaluate whether disseminated mineralization halos exist and to assess their spatial relationship to mapped electromagnetic conductors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Results from the re-sampling work confirmed that massive sulfide veins occur within broader disseminated halos extending over substantial downhole lengths (Table 1). The highest-grade intercepts are spatially associated with mapped electromagnetic conductors, supporting the interpretation that these conductors represent mineralized sulfide trends rather than isolated occurrences. The Table of results shown below reflects significant intervals of mineralization in the core that integrates both the historical assay results with the new assay intervals completed by the Company (Table 2). This reflects a more complete picture of the extent and tenor of mineralization the historical drillhole dataset.

Historical drill holes that are observed to have strong Cu-Ni-PGM mineralization are spatially correlated with mapped electromagnetic conductors (show as red lines on Figure 2). Where historical drill holes were observed to have modest Cu-Ni-PGMM mineralization, they are not spatially coincident with the electromagnetic conductors. Future exploration plans will focus on testing electromagnetic conductor trends and step-out targets between and beyond historic core holes.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">District Context</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mineralization at Skibo occurs along the basal contact of the Duluth Complex, a geological setting that hosts several copper-nickel deposits in Minnesota.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about AI's potential as a destructive force on U.S. jobs have contributed to a rally in the 10-year note and 30-year bond, sending their yields to the lowest levels since November </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI fear trade appears to be spilling into the U.S. bond market, according to Lawrence Gillum of LPL Financial. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bond market has caught a bid over much of the past month, with buyers stepping into a crucial part of the $30 trillion Treasury market partly because of anxiety over artificial intelligence's potential to wipe out many U.S. jobs, according to strategist Lawrence Gillum of LPL Financial. Under Gillum's theory, the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, is linked at least in part to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity. In other words, AI-driven anxiety may be pushing bond-market yields lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which is a peg for pricing new 30-year fixed mortgages, finished below 4.02% and at its lowest level since Nov. 26, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  Meanwhile, the yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y fell below 4.7% to the lowest 3 p.m. Eastern time level of the past three months. The drop in yields occurred despite a lack of any data or non-AI-related events that could explain those moves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling long-term yields since January have spilled over into mortgage financing, where rates for new 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen below the 6% threshold for the first time in 31/2 years, according to Freddie Mac. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Mortgage rates fall below 6%, giving buyers a glimpse of affordability </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury yields can be influenced by a variety of things - such as the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, expectations for the path of interest rates, and rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East. What's interesting now is that long-term yields are trending lower even though the U.S. economy is holding up, expectations for the Federal Reserve's next rate cut have been pushed back to July, and the U.S. and Iran are involved in nuclear talks in Geneva that could reportedly produce an agreement. While economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. Thursday's bond-market moves \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted. The strategist added that traders seemed to be more focused on AI's disinflationary impacts than on the potential for elevated inflation pressures over the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, investors remained focused on the likely winners and losers from AI. Major stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP finished mostly lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
