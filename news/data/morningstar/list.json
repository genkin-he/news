            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about AI's potential as a destructive force on U.S. jobs have contributed to a rally in the 10-year note and 30-year bond, sending their yields to the lowest levels since November </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI fear trade appears to be spilling into the U.S. bond market, according to Lawrence Gillum of LPL Financial. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bond market has caught a bid over much of the past month, with buyers stepping into a crucial part of the $30 trillion Treasury market partly because of anxiety over artificial intelligence's potential to wipe out many U.S. jobs, according to strategist Lawrence Gillum of LPL Financial. Under Gillum's theory, the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, is linked at least in part to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity. In other words, AI-driven anxiety may be pushing bond-market yields lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which is a peg for pricing new 30-year fixed mortgages, finished below 4.02% and at its lowest level since Nov. 26, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  Meanwhile, the yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y fell below 4.7% to the lowest 3 p.m. Eastern time level of the past three months. The drop in yields occurred despite a lack of any data or non-AI-related events that could explain those moves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling long-term yields since January have spilled over into mortgage financing, where rates for new 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen below the 6% threshold for the first time in 31/2 years, according to Freddie Mac. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Mortgage rates fall below 6%, giving buyers a glimpse of affordability </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury yields can be influenced by a variety of things - such as the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, expectations for the path of interest rates, and rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East. What's interesting now is that long-term yields are trending lower even though the U.S. economy is holding up, expectations for the Federal Reserve's next rate cut have been pushed back to July, and the U.S. and Iran are involved in nuclear talks in Geneva that could reportedly produce an agreement. While economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. Thursday's bond-market moves \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted. The strategist added that traders seemed to be more focused on AI's disinflationary impacts than on the potential for elevated inflation pressures over the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, investors remained focused on the likely winners and losers from AI. Major stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP finished mostly lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The restructuring will bring Block's (XYZ) employee count below 6,000 versus more than 10,000 today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The layoffs at Block come just days after Citrini Research rattled markets with the publication of a blog post detailing a fictional scenario in which AI productivity tools were so powerful that they forced widespread shifts in the U.S. labor market. These particularly impacted knowledge workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" CEO Jack Dorsey said in a shareholder letter. \"We're already seeing it internally.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about AI's potential as a destructive force on U.S. jobs have contributed to a rally in the 10-year note and 30-year bond, sending their yields to the lowest level since November </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI fear trade appears to be spilling into the U.S. bond market, according to Lawrence Gillum of LPL Financial. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bond market has caught a bid over much of the past month, with buyers stepping into a crucial part of the $30 trillion Treasury market partly because of anxiety over artificial intelligence's potential to wipe out many U.S. jobs, according to strategist Lawrence Gillum of LPL Financial. Under Gillum's theory, the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, is linked at least in part to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity. In other words, AI-driven anxiety may be pushing bond-market yields lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which is a peg for pricing new 30-year fixed mortgages, finished below 4.02% and at its lowest level since Nov. 26, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  Meanwhile, the yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y fell below 4.7% to the lowest 3 p.m. Eastern time level of the past three months. The drop in yields occurred despite a lack of any data or non-AI-related events that could explain those moves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling long-term yields since January have spilled over into mortgage financing, where rates for new 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen below the 6% threshold for the first time in 31/2 years, according to Freddie Mac. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Mortgage rates fall below 6%, giving buyers a glimpse of affordability </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury yields can be influenced by a variety of things - such as the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, expectations for the path of interest rates, and rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East. What's interesting now is that long-term yields are trending lower even though the U.S. economy is holding up, expectations for the Federal Reserve's next rate cut have been pushed back to July, and the U.S. and Iran are involved in nuclear talks in Geneva that could reportedly produce an agreement. While economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. Thursday's bond-market moves \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted. The strategist added that traders seemed to be more focused on AI's disinflationary impacts than on the potential for elevated inflation pressures over the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, investors remained focused on the likely winners and losers from AI. Major stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP finished mostly lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The step supports the company's efforts to enhance energy supply security and grid reliability in line with the objectives of Vision 2030.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Eng. Khalid Al-Ghamdi, Chief Executive Officer of Saudi Energy, said the transformation builds on financial, regulatory and structural reforms implemented in the electricity sector since 2020 under the Ministerial Committee for the Restructuring of the Electricity Sector, chaired by HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Minister of Energy, to achieve the sector's objectives and improve service quality for consumers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Al-Ghamdi emphasized that the new identity draws on the company's established legacy, marks a new chapter in its journey, and represents an evolution in role and responsibility rather than a change in its core business.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">He noted that the launch constitutes a strategic step toward reinforcing a modern institutional image grounded in trust, sustainability and future readiness, reaffirming Saudi Energy's commitment to supporting the energy sector and contributing to sustainable growth and prosperity across the Kingdom.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"We are building on a strong legacy in the electricity sector and moving forward with an identity that reflects our readiness for a more integrated phase.

This includes enhancing sector reliability and efficiency by achieving an optimal electricity generation mix, displacing liquid fuels to strengthen supply security, modernizing, automating and expanding transmission and distribution networks, increasing localization, attracting investment, and advancing the Kingdom's environmental objectives.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">It added that the launch of the new identity builds on the company's long-standing national legacy in supplying electricity across the Kingdom and reinforces its position as a key enabler of electrical infrastructure. It also highlights its central role in enhancing grid reliability, modernizing and automating its infrastructure, and supporting the integration of energy sources, contributing to system stability and long-term energy security. The evolution continues under the existing regulatory framework governing the company's licensed activities across generation, transmission, distribution, storage and power system enablement, ensuring continuity in its operating model and governance structure.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The company said that under its new identity, Saudi Energy places customer centricity at the core of its operating strategy, embodied in its corporate promise, \"Around you, for you.\" It added that it remains committed to enhancing customer experience, strengthening service quality, advancing digital engagement channels and responding effectively to the needs of individuals, businesses and industrial sectors, contributing to improved quality of life and economic competitiveness.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The company added that the transformation further aligns Saudi Energy with international best practices in managing and operating energy networks and critical infrastructure, strengthening operational efficiency and reinforcing its role as a key enabler of electrical infrastructure, while supporting the Kingdom's broader positioning as a global energy hub.</p><span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Restricted - مقيد</p></span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Contact Information:</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Saudi Energy</strong><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">966920001100</strong><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:933@se.com.sa\" tabindex=\"0\">933@se.com.sa</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">SOURCE:</strong> Saudi Electricity Company</p><br/><br/>View the original <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/oil-gas-and-energy/saudi-electricity-company-launches-new-corporate-identity-rebrands-as-saudi-ener-1141551\" tabindex=\"0\">press release</a> on ACCESS Newswire<br/><br/>\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--0-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:0;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/img.ashx?id=1141551\"/></picture></span></div>",
