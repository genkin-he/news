With 42% margins, you'd expect a richer valuation, but Waystar trades at about seven-times sales - a far cry from bubble territory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Next, look at the enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) leaders where AI genuinely enhances products, rather than cannibalizing core businesses: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Atlassian (TEAM): Atlassian's growth remains solid - fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.38 billion - and the company is leaning into AI as a core pillar. Its centerpiece is Atlassian Rovo, an AI \"teammate\" introduced in May 2024 that layers search, chat and AI agents across Jira, Confluence and other tools to help teams find information, summarize work and automate workflows. With a base of more than 300,000 customers, deeply embedded products (Jira, Confluence) and a potent AI layer, Atlassian is one of the purer enterprise SaaS AI plays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DocuSign (DOCU): Shares of DocuSign tumbled at the end of September after headlines framed OpenAI's new \"DocuGPT\" as a competitive threat. In reality, DocuGPT was presented as an internal OpenAI agent that converts contracts into structured, searchable data - not an e-signature platform or commercial DocuSign replacement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff overlooked DocuSign's real strength: its entrenched legal-compliance infrastructure, enterprise integrations and a growing Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform that uses AI to analyze and manage contracts end to end. These capabilities are deeply embedded across regulated industries and supported by the company's roughly $900 million in annual free cash flow, allowing continued investment and share repurchases. With AI enhancing - not replacing - its core workflow moat, DocuSign remains one of the most undervalued enterprise automation plays amid AI-driven market confusion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adobe (ADBE): Adobe reported $6 billion in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up roughly 11% year over year, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.31. The company also noted that its AI-influenced annual recurring revenue surpassed $5 billion, and its generative-AI-model family (Adobe Firefly) has already produced more than 24 billion pieces of content. Despite this, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 - well below its historical 10-year average of 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The thesis is brutally simple: These companies boast loyal users, documented time- and cost-savings tools, and deep integration that customers keep paying for regardless of headline volatility. They aren't betting on the farm on AI; they're using it to widen existing competitive moats and improve unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your bubble-management playbook </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The timeline for maximum disruption in AI runs from the beginning of 2026 until the third quarter of 2027. This is the point when both the AI pilot launches that haven't produced a return on investment and the 2021-2023 AI startups run out of capital. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports that 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024, with the average organization scrapping 46% of AI proof of concepts before production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates the framework for a slow-motion AI-bubble deflation, rather than a catastrophic burst: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 1 hyperscalers with diversified revenue will weather disappointing AI returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 2 unicorns face valuation compression or acquisition. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 3 experiences mass casualties, with a small cohort of survivors demonstrating actual unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three plays outlined above position investors for this selective deflation: buying Tier 1 quality on 15% to 20% corrections; positioning in data-center infrastructure ahead of verified 2027 constraints; and accumulating profitable companies - whether routine automation or mispriced SaaS - being unfairly sold off alongside failing startups. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI bubble is deflating on schedule - but the infrastructure buildout and automation revolution remain genuine opportunities for investors who can distinguish between speculative AI startups burning cash and profitable enterprises solving real problems with measurable returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: These stocks are the real deal for investors in AI - Wall Street is just chasing bubbles </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Here are the stocks to buy - and when. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I've been watching the AI bubble inflate for months now - the unsustainable burn rates, the pilot projects that went nowhere, the startups that couldn't explain their unit economics. So when industry insiders finally started ringing alarm bells, I couldn't resist diving deeper into what's really happening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What I found surprised me. Yes, there's an AI bubble. But the viral claim that it's 17-times larger than the dot-com crash is misleading. MacroStrategy Partnership's headline-grabbing analysis measured total capital misallocation across all asset classes, not AI specifically. It seems to me that the math behind the analysis was designed to terrify, not inform. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More importantly, everyone's asking the wrong question. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The debate shouldn't be whether the AI bubble will pop - that's already happening. Not in some dramatic, market-crushing way that will dominate headlines, but through a slow-motion deflation that's quietly reshaping the entire landscape. The casualties are already piling up: startup shutdowns surged in 2024; in 2025, 95% of enterprise AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact within six months of launch; and down rounds this year hit a decade high at 15.9% of all venture deals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many companies that scream the loudest about the bubble are either exaggerating the threat or fundamentally misunderstanding what's actually unfolding. This isn't the 2000 dot-com collapse all over again. It's far more interesting and far more profitable if you know where to look. I've identified three distinct market tiers facing radically different fates: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 1: The hyperscalers (Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)) are essentially unassailable. Their estimated $320 billion to $340 billion in 2025 capex spending - largely for AI and cloud infrastructure - comes from operating cash flow generated by their core businesses. They can weather extended periods of disappointing AI returns because their core businesses print money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 2: The unicorns in limbo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI) command massive valuations but face existential questions. Can they achieve returns that justify stratospheric valuations? Can they compete against both hyperscalers with infinite resources and substantially cheaper models coming in from overseas? The next 18 to 24 months will separate the winners and losers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 3: Mass casualties are showing up in the numbers. We're seeing more shutdowns (up 26% year over year in 2024), decade-high down rounds in 2025, thinner deal counts and smaller checks, plus enterprises scrapping a big chunk of AI work and failing to get a return on investment (ROI) from pilots. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Expectations are being managed to engineer an orderly deflation rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Sam Altman openly admits that investors as a whole are overexcited about AI at the same time his OpenAI reaches a valuation of $500 billion, he's not confessing failure - he's managing expectations to engineer an orderly deflation, rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates a rare market asymmetry: The public sees \"bubble\" and flees everything AI-related, while sophisticated capital is making precise bets on deflation survivors. Here are three investment strategies to put you on the winning side of any correction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     1. Buy Tier 1 hyperscalers after the 15% to 20% correction </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When the next correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft: Microsoft's AI business is already at a $13 billion annual run rate, up 175% year over year, but most of its money still comes from core products including Azure, Office and Windows. With about $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Microsoft can easily fund its AI buildout without stretching its balance sheet. A pullback in the stock to $400 to $420 would bring the valuation back to around 30-times earnings - right at historical norms and a strong long-term entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon.com: Amazon's cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing about 17.5% year over year, hitting a $123 billion annual run rate. The bulk of Amazon's revenue still comes from retail and e-commerce, giving the company the cash flow and scale to invest heavily in AI infrastructure without jeopardizing its core business. If the shares pulled back 15%, the valuation would drop into the 27- to 30-times-earnings range, offering a potentially compelling entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet: Internet-search advertising still accounts for roughly 56% of revenue, and for the second quarter of 2025, the company posted an operating margin of 32.4%. Estimated capital expenditures for 2025 are roughly $85?billion, much of which is going into AI and data-center infrastructure, yet Alphabet maintains a strong balance sheet to absorb variable returns. A correction of 15% to 20% would lower the valuation to about 22- to 23-times earnings, potentially offering the best entry within the hyperscaler group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DeepSeek's January 2025 reveal triggered a brief panic across AI stocks; hyperscalers slipped 2% to 5%, while AI chip and infrastructure names plunged 15% to 30% before rebounding within days. The takeaway for investors is clear: When the next 15% to 20% correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee - the long-term infrastructure buildout remains intact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Believe the hype: AI is coming for your job. Plan now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     2. Invest in data centers before power constraints are a given </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gartner's November 2024 forecast warns that 40% of AI data centers could face power-availability constraints by 2027, underscoring the physical limits of AI expansion. The firm projects that AI computing workloads alone could consume around 500 terawatt-hours of electricity annually by 2027 - more than two-and-a-half times the 195 TWh used in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dominion Energy (D) is ground zero for the AI power crunch. In Virginia - the world's most populous area for data centers - data-center capacity demand has nearly doubled in just five months, jumping from 21 gigawatts under contract to more than 40. These servers already consume a quarter of the state's electricity, and Dominion expects demand to double again by 2039. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To keep up, Dominion is spending $50 billion over the next five years on new electric-transmission projects and infrastructure upgrades -including an offshore wind project, a solar and battery storage project, and five small modular reactors planned for the 2030s. The stock throws off a 4% to 5% dividend yield, but what really matters is positioning: Dominion isn't just a utility anymore - it's becoming the backbone of the AI era's grid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vistra (VST): Vistra signed a 20-year deal to supply 1,200 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power from its Comanche Peak facility to an investment-grade buyer. It's also adding 860 MW of new gas capacity at its Permian Basin site (boosting it to 1,185 MW) and has outlined up to 2,000 MW of Texas gas additions by 2028 to meet surging data-center and industrial load. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition, data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Digital Realty Trust (DLR): Operates more than 300 data centers globally and has a long record of annual dividend increases. The stock's current dividend yield runs close to 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equinix (EQIX) operates more than 270 data centers serving in excess of 10,000 customers. Last year, the company marked 85 consecutive quarters of top-line growth and said announced projects were more than 85% leased and preleased as of the first quarter of 2025, underscoring demand from hyperscalers and large enterprises. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vertiv (VRT): Nvidia (NVDA) last year partnered with Vertiv for AI data-center builds, and Vertiv's stock has soared. The company's valuation is high, but the stock is riding a market that Goldman Sachs sees jumping to $10.6 billion next year, from $4.1 billion in 2023, as liquid cooling reaches 57% of AI servers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Schneider Electric (FR:SU) (SBGSY): This French multinational is a steadier way to play the data-center theme, with a 24% exposure to data-center end markets and 25% fourth-quarter growth in North American energy management on surging AI demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Conservative investors should build positions in companies poised to profit from the coming power crunch. As AI data centers push grid capacity to its limits, these firms stand to benefit from the multiyear investment cycle required to expand power generation, cooling and infrastructure. With the 2027 constraint window approaching, the next year offers a favorable entry period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     3. Buy what the market has mispriced </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The stock market is committing a cardinal error: indiscriminately punishing profitable companies with documented ROI along with speculative AI startups with no path to profitability. This creates two distinct opportunities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, look at companies that solve unglamorous back-office problems through automation. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UiPath (PATH): UiPath boasts 83% gross margins and its solid client base includes giants such as Orange Spain (FR:ORA) (ORANY) and Travis Perkins (UK:TPK) (TPRKY), yet the stock trades at about four-times sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BlackLine (BL): Third-party studies show triple-digit ROI from BlackLine's close automation - 234% ROI at Creditsafe (12.4-month payback) and 379% ROI at Red Wing (Nucleus Research). BlackLine returned to GAAP profitability in 2024 and authorized a $200 million share repurchase (later increased by another $200 million). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  11-01-25 1119ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some locales, like Kyoto and San Diego, are increasing the taxes they levy on visitors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These days, local taxes can easily add more than $100 to the bill for a hotel stay - and the businesses don't even get the money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your hotel bill may soon be getting higher - and it could have nothing to do with the room rate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A number of cities are upping the taxes they levy on hotel guests. The add-on expense, sometimes referred to as a \"bed tax\" or \"tourist tax,\" can equate to hundreds of dollars in certain instances, depending on the locale and how long a guest stays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example: In Washington, D.C., the hotel tax now stands at 15.95%, following a slight increase approved by city officials in 2022 that was recently extended to September 2027. For a four-night stay at a hotel that charges $216 a night - the average daily D.C. room rate, according to CoStar, a real-estate analytics company - that comes out to $138 in bed taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But it can get more expensive in other markets: In Kyoto, one of Japan's most popular tourist destinations, a new bed-tax rate that is set to go into effect next March adds as much as $65 a night to a hotel stay. That translates into a $455 add-on for a week's visit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other municipalities that have hopped on the bed tax-hike bandwagon include San Diego (from 10.5% up to 13.75%); Aurora, Ill. (from 3% to 6%); and Oklahoma City (from 5.5% to 9.25%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's no secret why cities levy these taxes and often opt to increase them: It's a way of raising revenue without tapping local residents for more. And the money generated, which can total millions of dollars over time, is often tied to tourism, as in marketing campaigns designed to attract visitors to the destination. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, no visitor likes paying these taxes, but cities are hopeful that the amounts will be small enough that it won't stop tourists from coming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You don't want to discourage usage,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Holt noted that the city made sure that its bed-tax rate wouldn't be out of line compared to competing municipalities. \"We did all the research,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A similar point was raised by tourism officials with Washington, D.C., who said that the city's 15.95% bed-tax rate is still lower than or on par with a number of prominent municipalities across the country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Indeed, a 2024 study from the U.S. Travel Association, in partnership with consulting firm Civitas, found the average lodging levy to be 15.22%. That's up from 14.52% in 2018. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amanda Belarmino, a tourism expert who teaches at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's William F. Harrah College of Hospitality, said the increase in bed-tax rates may be partly due to the pandemic and the need for cities to make up for lost revenue. But she said other factors are also at play, including the aforementioned hard-to-ignore reality that it's \"more politically popular\" to stick tourists with a tax hike than locals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But will tourists push back at some point and just avoid visiting because of higher bed taxes? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We have not seen a lot of evidence of 'sticker shock' as of yet,\" Belarmino said. But she didn't rule out the possibility that some of the recent nationwide decline in tourism, especially among foreign visitors, could be attributable to traveler frustration with taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Milos Eric, co-founder of OysterLink, a hospitality-job platform, believes hotels in certain locales are definitely taking a hit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In some of the most popular cities with the biggest taxes, we're seeing more travelers shift to alternative accommodations or to the suburbs to keep their overall price down on the stay,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another point of concern among travelers: Bed taxes are not always fully made known - at least at first glance - when looking at room rates online. That is, you might see a posted rate for the room itself, but when you go to book, you'll find the add-on expenses, which can include taxes as well as those ubiquitous resort fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's frustrating that some platforms are fully transparent while others hide additional charges until checkout, making it hard to compare costs accurately,\" said Caroline Morse Teel, executive editor of the SmarterTravel website. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Weston Blasi </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One sportsbook had 96.7% of World Series bets on the Dodgers to beat the Blue Jays once the matchup was finalized </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most sports bettors want the Dodgers to win the World Series. Sportsbooks are praying for the Blue Jays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tonight, the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win their first MLB World Series since 1993. And U.S. sportsbooks hope that they win, too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's because the Los Angeles Dodgers were heavily favored to beat Toronto in the series. In fact, once this year's World Series matchup was finalized, almost every single bet (96.7%) made on ESPN Bet over which team would win the World Series was made in favor of the Dodgers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The wagers have been driven by the Dodgers' popularity as reigning champions and as home to one of the best players in baseball, Shohei Ohtani. And this type of overwhelming liability could lead to a bad outcome for sports-betting companies if the Blue Jays don't win and the sportsbooks have to pay up - again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Betting companies are already coming off a football season where FanDuel owner Flutter (FLUT) took a $370 million hit on NFL games after casual bettors benefited from some of the most \"customer-friendly\" betting outcomes that online sportsbooks have ever seen. So while a Toronto win would mean paying out some long-shot futures, it would still be a far better result for the betting operators than another Dodgers victory - which would trigger huge payouts on the most bet-on team all season. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sportsbooks typically favor outcomes that go against the majority of wagers placed on a sporting event, which is why nearly all of them are pulling for the Blue Jays right now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Before the World Series began, the Blue Jays winning it all was a good outcome for the sportsbook,\" Seamus Magee, trading manager at BetMGM, told MarketWatch in an email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But sports-betting companies are glad that the Dodgers have given them a run for their money. \"Toronto is still the preferred winner, but we wouldn't mind seeing a Game 7,\" Magee added - the day before the Dodgers  pulled off a crucial double play toward the end of Game 6 that pushed the series into a seventh game. Sportsbooks generally prefer longer series, because more games equals more bets - and more juice for the sportsbooks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the Blue Jays winning the whole thing would provide a lifeline to betting companies. \"We definitely need the Blue Jays. Toronto winning would be a strong result for us,\" Caesars Sports head of baseball trading Eric Biggio told Fox. \"If you know of any Blue Jays backers with deep pockets, you can send them our way.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The two most popular individual prop bets on BetMGM for Game 6 on Halloween night were Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hitting over 0.5 home runs (+400), and Ohtani hitting over 0.5 home runs (+195). The biggest liability for World Series MVP - as in, the players who sportsbooks least want to see win the award - are Ohtani, Guerrero Jr. and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, in that order. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition to ESPN Bet (DIS), BetMGM (MGM) and Caesars (CZR), other U.S. sportsbooks were also showing an overwhelming amount of bets on the Dodgers heading into Game 6. But it's not just bets that were made in the days leading up to the World Series; fans have been backing the Dodgers all year long. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From the archives: How does a gambling site lose money? DraftKings just lost $250 million in revenue - mostly on NFL games. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Toronto opened the season at +6000 odds to win the World Series before the season (1.6% implied probability of winning), while the Dodgers went into the season at roughly +750 odds. In other words, expectations were low for Toronto heading into the year, and high for the Dodgers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even with those long-shot odds for Toronto, sportsbooks would rather pay out those bets than face the heavy losses that would occur with a Dodgers series win. That's because the Dodgers were the most wagered-on team in terms of total futures bets, and in total money at nearly every major sportsbook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to betting data from DraftKings (DKNG), at the start of the MLB playoffs, 36% (or over 1 in 3) of all World Series winner bets were made for the Dodgers - more than triple the amount of bets on the next most wagered-on team. The Dodgers also had 22% of all money wagered (otherwise known as handle) to win the World Series. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More bets were on the Los Angeles Dodgers than any other team to win the 2025 World Series. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not clear exactly how much sportsbooks would lose if the Dodgers were to win tonight, as the ones mentioned in this story declined to comment on potential loss amounts or betting figures. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several members of the r/BlueJays subreddit have begun sharing that they placed small wagers on their team to win the World Series at long odds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"That $20, +6000 bet I put pre-season on winning the WS is looking a lot more realistic,\" one Reddit user posted before the playoffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I grabbed it at +7500!\" another user wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sportsbooks typically profit from the \"vig,\" their commission on each bet. However, their strategy involves more than just balancing wagers. When a popular team, such as the Dodgers or Yankees, is heavily favored, sportsbooks adjust the odds to encourage betting on the underdog to minimize their risk. Despite this, sometimes bettors still take the favorite - and win. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Unfavorable sports-betting outcomes can really hurt sportsbooks' bottom lines. For example, FanDuel, the Flutter Entertainment sportsbook, took a $74 million loss during a regular-season NFL game between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers, which ended in a 40-34 win for the favored Lions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For sportsbooks, the stakes are high and their rooting interest is clear: They're all in on the Blue Jays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Sportsbooks were called 'victims' in new NBA gambling probe. Here's what DraftKings, FanDuel have to say. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Weston Blasi </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Many Americans may turn to high-deductible plans this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     High-deductible health plans can seem like an attractive option for health-insurance shoppers looking to lower their monthly premium  payments. But consumers should consider their health status and cash savings before making the switch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As open enrollment for 2026 health-insurance plans begins Nov. 1, millions of Americans are bracing for premium hikes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Health insurers that sell policies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare, are charging 26% more on average next year, according to nonprofit research group KFF. Employers are also bracing for higher insurance costs, with the average cost of healthcare per worker expected to jump 6.5%, according to a survey from the human-resource advisory firm Mercer. That would be the biggest surge since 2010.  As a result, employees will likely face higher paycheck deductions or more out-of-pocket spending on deductibles or copays, according to Mercer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With premiums on the rise and changes coming to the ACA marketplace, KFF says more people may opt for high-deductible health plans, trading lower monthly premiums for higher upfront costs and the benefit of a tax-advantaged health savings accounts (known as HSAs) - which are typically offered to people who sign up for high-deductible plans. But, according to experts, holders of these high-deductible policies must be financially prepared to cover unexpected health costs, and the best insurance plan for you can vary based on your health status and tax bracket. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People make their insurance decisions based on how they expect to use their healthcare next year, which is tough because it's impossible to forecast healthcare needs, said Drew Shockley, co-founder of health-insurance-planning firm Move Health. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If someone says, 'I'm thinking about getting pregnant and I'm going to have a baby next year?'

How do we plan for that?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As the financial stakes rise, here's what you need to know to be a savvy health-insurance shopper as open enrollment begins, from the potential downsides of high-deductible health plans to changes in the ACA marketplace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More ACA plans now come with health savings accounts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, reclassified Bronze and Catastrophic ACA plans as high-deductible plans, making them eligible for an HSA in 2026. Information about different coverage tiers is available on Healthcare.gov. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts for medical expenses that can accumulate funds through contributions. They can be invested after reaching a minimum. These accounts are often seen as retirement vehicles because they can grow over time, and after age 65, that money can be withdrawn for nonmedical expenses without penalty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For your plan to be eligible for an HSA, it must have a deductible of at least $1,700 for individual coverage and $3,400 for families, according to Fidelity. (The deductible is the amount of money you have to pay for healthcare before your insurance starts covering some costs.) The HSA contribution limits in 2026 are $4,400 for an individual and $8,750 for family coverage. Those 55 and older who are not enrolled in Medicare can contribute an additional $1,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ask yourself these questions before getting a high-deductible plan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Determining if a high-deductible plan is right for you is largely dependent on your health status and income. Ask yourself the following questions to avoid a future unexpected medical bill you can't pay off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What are my expected healthcare needs for the year? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is one of the questions Todd Calamita, a Charlotte, N.C.-based certified financial planner, asked himself before he and his wife switched to a high-deductible plan a decade ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you're generally healthy, require only preventive care and don't anticipate frequent doctor visits or medications, the lower premiums of an HDHP (high-deductible health plan) can make sense,\" Calamita said. \"However, if you manage chronic conditions or need ongoing prescriptions, an HDHP may be less cost-effective.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, if you go to therapy or a psychiatrist regularly, those visits must be paid out-of-pocket until you hit the deductible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Are online pharmacies cheaper than your local drugstore?

Direct-primary-care providers charge patients a monthly, quarterly or annual fee in lieu of insurance billing for unlimited visits and clinical and laboratory services, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You'll have to pay a subscription fee, but they can provide a lot of what you need that will be way less than your deductible,\" McClanahan said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do I have enough cash to cover the full deductible if needed? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Be comfortable with the possibility of large upfront medical bills because of out-of-pocket costs until the deductible is met. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I quietly chuckle when a doctor's office tells me, 'Don't worry, it's covered by insurance,'\" Calamita said. \"Because I know that I first have to hit $8,300 out-of-pocket cost.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Does it make sense for someone in my tax bracket to use an HSA? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSAs come with a \"triple tax benefit\" - contributions are tax-deductible, funds grow tax-free and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax-free. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because of these benefits, the higher a person's marginal tax bracket is, the more they save up front. For example, a person in the 35% tax bracket - who earns between $256,225 and $640,600 in 2026 - saves 35 cents on every dollar contributed, making the tax deduction more valuable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The new IRS tax brackets for 2026 are here.

This can be particularly effective when you don't have your HSA debit card on you or if you received a medical bill larger than your HSA balance and you want to reimburse yourself over time as your balance grows, according to Fidelity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You might also prefer to use a rewards credit card on qualified expenses to rack up points and then reimburse yourself with HSA funds later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSA-qualified expenses include over-the-counter medications, menstrual products, postpartum care, healthcare-related travel, family planning and substance-abuse treatments, according to MetLife (MET).

It's insurance against bad things happening,\" McKeon said. \"Whereas if you're able to combine it with a savings feature ... it's not just a safeguard against an emergency; it's actually planning for the long term as well, which I think is a great combination.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's who is facing the biggest jump in ACA premiums </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The biggest ACA-related issue tied up in the current budget fight is whether Congress will extend the enhanced premium tax credits first expanded under the American Rescue Plan and set to expire at the end of 2025. Without an extension, those expanded subsidies - which currently help Americans earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level afford marketplace coverage - would lapse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is barreling toward a terrible record. These financial pain points could end it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An individual earning $62,600 a year, or a family of four making $128,600, represents 400% of the federal poverty level in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. About 1 to 2 million people could lose eligibility for the enhanced subsidies at the end of the year, Shockley said - a relatively small slice of the roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees who now receive financial help. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People making below 400% of the federal poverty level will still qualify for tax credits, but anyone earning even a small amount over the income cap would have to pay the full cost of a marketplace plan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're literally just going back to the original regulations that the Obama administration put in place in 2014,\" Shockley said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  11-01-25 1023ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
