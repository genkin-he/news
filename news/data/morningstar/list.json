(NYSE: NEE) announced today that it has priced its public offering of $2.00 billion of equity units. The transaction is expected to close on March 3, 2026.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2804083/NextEra_Energy_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2804083/NextEra_Energy_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">NextEra Energy, Inc. has granted the underwriters an option to purchase during the 13-day period beginning on, and including, the closing date up to an additional aggregate stated amount of $0.30 billion, solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The net proceeds from the sale of the equity units, which are expected to be approximately $1.97 billion (or approximately $2.27 billion if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting discount but before deducting other offering expenses, will be added to the general funds of NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy. NextEra Energy Capital Holdings expects to use its general funds to fund investments in energy and power projects and for other general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of its outstanding commercial paper obligations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Each equity unit will be issued in a stated amount of $50. Each equity unit will consist of a contract to purchase NextEra Energy common stock in the future, and undivided beneficial ownership interests in two series of debentures issued by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, consisting of a Series P Debenture due March 1, 2031, and a Series Q Debenture due March 1, 2034, each with a principal amount of $1,000. The debentures will be guaranteed by NextEra Energy. Total annual distributions on the equity units will be at the rate of 7.375% on the stated amount of $50 per unit, consisting of interest on the debentures and payments under the stock purchase contracts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In approximately three years, each stock purchase contract will require the holder to purchase NextEra Energy common stock for cash, based on a per-share price range of $91.99 to $115.00. The higher end of this price range reflects a premium of approximately 25% over the New York Stock Exchange closing price of NextEra Energy common stock on Feb. 26, 2026, which was $91.99. The holders of the equity units must complete the stock purchase by no later than Feb. 15, 2029, with the required purchase price of stock purchased on that date determined based on the average closing price of NextEra Energy's common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on Feb. 12, 2029. The holders may satisfy their purchase obligations with proceeds raised from remarketing the debentures that comprise part of their equity units.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Upon settlement of the purchase contract, NextEra Energy will receive cash and will issue the requisite number of shares of its common stock. Before the issuance of NextEra Energy common stock upon settlement of the purchase contracts, the purchase contracts will be reflected in NextEra Energy's diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Wells Fargo Securities, BofA Securities, Citigroup and Mizuho will be joint book-running managers for the offering.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities to which this communication relates in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Management now seems to be acknowledging that it needs to make changes in a rapidly evolving landscape. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company announced some of those Thursday afternoon, alongside fiscal-fourth quarter earnings results. Duolingo's management disclosed that the transition could weigh on financials in the near term but expressed confidence in a long-term payoff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some investors may not be waiting to see how things play out, however, with Duolingo shares off more than 21% in Thursday's extended session. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Duolingo has been trying to integrate AI into its own product offerings, including by letting customers video-chat with an AI-powered animated character and engage in more voice-based AI experiences to test their progress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company announced it will move its core AI product, \"Video Call with Lily,\" to be part of the company's \"Super Duolingo tier\" subscription, down from its more exclusive \"Duolingo Max\" tier. It also announced new AI-powered lesson plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Further, Duolingo will try to respond to a growth slowdown in daily active users by increasing the value proposition of its free tier. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Software stocks bounce as Nvidia shares falter. Is a new rotation trade in store? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Up until now, the main way we've increased bookings per user is by adding small amounts of friction to encourage more people to subscribe, for example by increasing ad load or subscription upsells,\" Duolingo said in a shareholder letter. \"Unfortunately, we believe that this extra friction is part of the reason our DAU growth has slowed, so we've decided to prioritize user growth over monetization.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The moves are expected to come with several financial tradeoffs. For one, the company said in the letter that it expects revenue growth will \"step down sequentially\" in the second and third quarters, before \"stabilizing\" in the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bookings, meanwhile, are expected to grow just 11% this fiscal year, versus an almost 20% growth rate the company said it expected it would see \"if we operated like we have in past years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Profits will also come under pressure as the new moves require heavy investment. Duolingo expects a 25% margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the current fiscal year, versus the 29.5% margin it posted for its just-completed fiscal year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEO Luis von Ahn said in a video message that \"this may seem a little strange if you just look at the next quarter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But here we're trying to build a company for a very long time,\" he added, and that in the long term, the company's goal is to educate \"billions\" of people. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Salesforce's record $50 billion stock-buyback plan is proving controversial on Wall Street </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Hannah Pedone </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Salad chain is currently testing new wrap sandwiches, offered at lower prices, as diners stay selective on spending </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle have been dealing with discounted competition from fast-food and sit-down dining chains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A day after Cava's upbeat sales forecast raised hopes for the restaurant industry, rival fast-casual chain Sweetgreen is bringing them back to earth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen (SG) on Thursday forecast another year of falling same-store sales and said it would accelerate plans to turn itself around, as it deals with budget-conscious consumers and aggressive competition and discounting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fast-casual salad chain, in a statement, said the results came up short of even its own expectations. Those results arrived just two days after Sweetgreen launched new wrap sandwiches, priced a bit lower than some of its bowls and salads, after more expensive fare kept some customers away last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Sweetgreen (SG) were down 7% after hours on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The drop in Sweetgreen's stock price came after shares of rival Cava (CAVA) rocketed higher on Wednesday, following a forecast for a same-store sales gain this year. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain's CEO said customers could be getting tired of chasing discounts. However, other chains, like McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG), have been more tempered in their expectations for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Cava were down 0.6% after hours Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen's management on Thursday said it would move ahead with more urgency to strengthen service standards, introduce new menu items and speed up checkout times. It also plans to improve marketing around things like high-quality ingredients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEO Jonathan Neman said that the company was currently testing new wrap sandwiches, which it introduced on Tuesday in parts of New York, the Midwest and California. If those items do well, he said Sweetgreen plans to expand the offerings beyond that trial run in the middle of the year. The prices for those wraps start at $10.95. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen said fourth-quarter sales fell 3.5% to $155.2 million, with a per-share loss of 42 cents. Both figures were worse than analysts expected. Same-stores sales were down 11.5%, which weren't as bad as anticipated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The chain said it expects same-store sales to fall 2% to 4% this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the past year, fast-casual restaurants - which try to offer the quality of a sit-down chain at the speed of fast food - have been squeezed by value offerings from rivals like Chili's and McDonald's. Against that backdrop, Sweetgreen's stock is down 73.5% over the past 12 months. Over recent months, consumers have showed signs of waning interest in often-pricey salad and bowl offerings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ahead of the results, UBS analysts said Sweetgreen faced concerns over spending among younger consumers, who make up about a third of the people who visit the chain. They also noted that the chain has struggled in cities like Los Angeles and areas in the Northeast. During an earnings call in November, Sweetgreen said New York was its \"most challenged market.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many restaurants, after raising prices to cover for the past several years of supply shocks, are now trying to find ways to cut them after scaring customers away. But the discount war has weighed on margins and, in some cases, stock prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 13, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants had overstated CoreWeave's ability to meet customer demand for its service; (2) defendants materially understated the scope and severity of the risk that CoreWeave's reliance on a single third-party data center supplier presented for CoreWeave's ability to meet customer demand for its services; (3) the foregoing was reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on CoreWeave's revenue; (4) as a result, CoreWeave's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the CoreWeave class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628825-1&amp;h=1436079849&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50571&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50571\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50571</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.
