Among investor concerns were a lack of innovation in the iPhone business and a failure to capitalize on artificial intelligence the way other Big Tech players have. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In that sense, Apple's talk of robust iPhone 17 demand and plans for heightened AI spending came as some comfort, helping to drive Apple's stock 2% higher in Friday morning action. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst at Radio Free Mobile, said, \"iPhone replacement demand is more robust than it has been for several years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Apple earnings send the stock higher on upbeat iPhone commentary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But wasn't sold on a long-term Apple rebound, saying that some form-factor changes to the iPhone 17 may simply be getting iPhone users to upgrade iPhones earlier than they planned, meaning the company isn't seeing a sustainable change in its growth trajectory. The company is also dealing with the \"black hole that is its AI strategy,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Windsor noted that Apple shares are trading at a higher multiple than shares of fellow hardware players Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), MediaTek Inc. (TW:2454), Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KR:005930) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), despite growth struggles for the iPhone manufacturer. \"I would own any of these over Apple any day of the week,\" he wrote, while disclosing positions in Samsung and Qualcomm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Below are the forward price-to-earnings multiples for those five names, based on FactSet data </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Company                             Forward P/E \n   Apple                               33.02 \n   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  25.05 \n   MediaTek                            17.64 \n   Qualcomm                            14.41 \n   Samsung                             13.07 </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Needham's Laura Martin thought Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) stock (GOOG) looked like a more intriguing play than Apple's, given that shares of the Google parent company trade at a discount to Apple shares despite far better growth prospects. Alphabet's stock trades at 25.8 times forward earnings, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet's revenue is growing two to three times faster than Apple's, Martin added. And the internet giant has a more tangible strategy around large-language models and generative AI than Apple does, plus leading or near-leading positions in AI, search, mobile, video and the cloud, according to Martin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple faces a \"key strategic problem,\" in her view, because it can only use generative AI to enhance its ecosystem. Alphabet can use generative AI to improve Android as well - but through the cloud it can also \"charge a fee for thousands of other companies to use its LLM, which aids its enterprise profitability and gives it the ability lower Android prices and improve its operating leverage faster,\" she wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS's David Vogt joined the others in flagging Apple's high stock multiple. He acknowledged that \"near-term iPhone demand is solid,\" but said Apple shares were trading at 34 times his estimates for fiscal 2026 earnings, making for a premium of 40%-plus relative to the S&amp;P 500 SPX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Based on historical relative valuations, material share price appreciation in our view will likely have to come from positive earnings revisions,\" he wrote, as it's been \"difficult to sustain\" a premium of that magnitude. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Alphabet's stock looks like a better play than Meta's in the AI race </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Paul Hannon </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of England is set to take a big step toward embracing uncertainty as it follows through on the recommendations made by former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke after a review that was critical of its forecasting record. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Published in April 2024, the Bernanke review was one of the first steps taken by a leading central bank to understand why it underestimated a surge in prices that began in early 2021 and has yet to be fully tamed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Bernanke recommended that the BOE place more stress on developments that could upend its expectations for the U.K. economy and future interest rates, and less emphasis on a \"central\" forecast for growth and inflation that communicated too much certainty about the future. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The BOE has been edging away from its pre-Bernanke practices over the intervening period, and has offered a number of scenarios for growth and inflation that members of the Monetary Policy Committee have referred to in speeches as a way of setting out how their decisions might change with the circumstances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But the most decisive step forward will come Thursday, officials said, when the BOE publishes its quarterly Monetary Policy Report alongside its latest rate decision, which investors expect to be a hold at 4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Staff at the BOE outlined the reasoning behind the shift in a paper published earlier this month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The intention behind the changes is to highlight uncertainties about the outlook and how they might affect the path of interest rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  There will be more scenarios, and they will come with possible paths for the key rate, although those will be determined by policy rules formulated by the BOE's economists, rather than reflecting the views of individual rate setters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"As with any other input, there is no mechanical link between policy simulations and real-world monetary policy decisions,\" staff wrote in their paper. \"And these tools are stylised and simplified. So, they do not accurately reflect the MPC's real-world reaction function.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That is a distinction that reflects the BOE's continued reluctance to employ the \"dot plot\" favored by the Federal Reserve, which gives the interest rate forecasts of individual voting members. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  However, the nine members of the MPC will be given around 200 words each to explain their view of the rate decision and the outlook. Previously, the MPC's debate had been summarized by BOE officials, and the identities of the members making the arguments referred to in the minutes had been kept hidden, although their votes had not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  One of Bernanke's key recommendations was that policy makers should be clear when they as individuals don't fully believe in the assumptions that underlie the central forecast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The MPC's forecasts for growth and inflation are based on the assumption that the interest rate they set changes as investors expect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But policy makers often have a very different view of how rates should change, and that has led to confusion. In late 2022, for example, the BOE forecast that the U.K. economy would enter a deep recession, but that forecast assumed rates were going to rise more sharply than policymakers intended. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  What policymakers were actually doing was signaling that they wouldn't raise the key rate as rapidly as investors expected because such a big move in borrowing costs would tank the economy. However, business and consumer confidence was weakened by the recession call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central forecast is not going away, but it will play a less important role in decision making, as Bernanke recommended. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 09:44 ET (13:44 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jamie Chisholm </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about stock market exuberance build as AI tech spending sees shift to debt </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Burry was quoting the famous line from the movie Wargames, presumably about his willingness to participate in the AI-fueled bull market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's getting choppy. The heavy weighting afforded the megacap tech stocks meant the reception given to their third-quarter earnings was very likely to determine the stock market's short-term direction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And so, poorly-received reports from Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw the wider market retreat sharply on Thursday, while positivity over Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) results are pushing indices back up on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The volatility speaks to investors' sensitivity to any sign of cracks in the bullish AI narrative that is currently delivering stock market exuberance. And we can consider Michael Burry of hedge fund Scion Asset Management in the cautious camp. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a new message on X, Burry - who rose to fame after being featured in the Michael Lewis book \"The Big Short\" and was played by Christian Bale (below) in the movie  - delivered a poetic warning: \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" the latter a reference to the nuclear-showdown assessment from the movie Wargames. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because he is mainly known for his bets against esoteric credit assets ahead of the 2007-08 financial crisis, Burry is wrongly labelled as a perennial bear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that at the end of last year SAM held only long positions, with his top three bets on China's Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the end of the first quarter of 2025 he had tuned more cautious buying put options - a bet share prices will fall - on the three China tech companies. His biggest position was a put trade on Nvidia (NVDA), which did trend lower for the first four months of this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burry's next filing for the end of June shows that negative Nvidia position gone - though we don't know exactly when he closed it - which is just as well, because the chipmaker's stock has more than doubled since its April lows. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Instead, the portfolio was replete with bullish bets, including call options - the right to buy a stock - on Alibaba, Meta, ASML (ASML), UnitedHealth (UNH), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and lululemon athletica (LULU). Scion has held shares of Estee Lauder (EL) all year, the only constant. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burry's next 13-F for his holdings up to the end of September is due in about two weeks. It's still possible that it contains mainly long positions - after all the end of the third quarter was a month ago. But his latest social media message suggests he is nervous about the stock market's rally, and he's now adopting a much more defensive stance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One reason why observers like Burry may be getting more anxious is evidence of a shift in the funding of big tech capex. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Traders have been happy to see hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for AI-related investment, particularly as most of the money was sourced from company cashflow. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But Meta's recent deal to construct its Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, included a $30 billion financing package comprising mostly of debt held via a special purpose vehicle. The structure means Meta does not hold the debt on its balance sheet, helping to protect its credit rating. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The concern among some investors is that as companies look for ever more funding to deploy, they may use the Meta deal as a template. Spending cash from the kitty is clean, clear and less dangerous if things go wrong. Financial engineering using what could be called quantum debt, which can be two things at once - not debt according to the rating agencies, but Meta-backed debt according to the buyers - is more opaque and potentially more risky. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Financial Times and Bloomberg report that Meta is also looking at another $25 billion bond sale. Right now there's a prospectus filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission without a specified amount. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock-indices SPX DJIA COMP are higher at the opening bell as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y nudge up.

And it was something that Kelly Ripa, co-host of TV's \"Live with Kelly and Mark,\" addressed recently in a rant that has gotten attention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You know, we give good candy. Full-size candy. You think they'd take the win and say, 'Thank you.' But they go, 'I don't like Hershey's, can I get a Snickers bar? I want Skittles,'\" Ripa said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Her solution? \"I am tired of dealing with this. So, now I'm getting opaque bags and putting the candy in the bags and you get what you get. Bye-bye. See you later.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Ripa was speaking about the situation in New York City, there are no shortage of people complaining about the Halloween greed factor wherever they live. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One commenter on Reddit took note of kids who \"would grab a handful [of candy] when I would say 'grab 2 or 3.'\" Another commenter observed: \"It's not even little kids that are raiding the sweets, it's the older ones from 10-12 and teenagers and college kids that keep on taking the sweets.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Others describe scenarios even worse than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jan Norris, a resident of Riviera Beach, Fla., had to leave her home for a few minutes during one recent Halloween. So she put up a sign asking trick-or-treaters to take a limited amount of candy. But when she returned, she found everything was gone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I couldn't get over the audacity,\" she told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neither could Enid, a New Jersey resident who declined to give her last name. Not only did trick-or-treaters take all her candy one year after she, too, left her treats unattended, but they also swiped her porcelain Halloween bowl. Even more disturbing: Someone played a prank and damaged her electric doorbell, necessitating a repair that cost several hundred dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Enid told MarketWatch that she's given up on taking part in the Halloween ritual as a result. \"We're lights off,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Halloween is more expensive this year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, there are plenty of folks who continue to embrace the holiday - so much so that Halloween sales are projected to reach a record $13.1 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Candy sales account for $3.9 billion of that total. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There do appear to be growing expectations of full-size candy bars being doled out instead of the mini or \"fun size\" versions that were long the Halloween norm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But consumers may be feeling especially pinched this year when it comes to candy. Prices for the sweet treats are higher, particularly because of the rising cost of chocolate. Wells Fargo recently reported that cocoa prices have more than doubled since the beginning of 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tariffs have also had an impact on Halloween costs - most notably for decorations and costumes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Combine the greed factor with the price hikes and you have a recipe for misery, some say. In certain cases, people are reporting that their candy budgets are now $200 or more. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Moneyist (2024): This Halloween, I'm not buying candy for trick or treaters. I have better things to spend my money on. Am I a bad person? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not that you can't find ways to save. Some consumers say they find deals by shopping at warehouse clubs like Costco (COST), or through Amazon (AMZN). They can even find full-size bars at a decent price at those places. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Even with concerns about price increases due to tariffs, Halloween continues to resonate with consumers of all ages,\" said Katherine Cullen, vice president of industry and consumer insights at the NRF. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But as the NRF data suggest, it doesn't look like folks are giving up on the idea of spending big for Halloween - just the opposite, in fact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for problematic and demanding trick-or-treaters, Darby Fox, a child and family therapist based in the New York metropolitan area, says that's symptomatic of the times. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We don't teach manners anymore,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fox added that Halloween provides a good opportunity for parents to teach their children to be polite and graciously accept any treats they're offered. If anything, she suggests the holiday should be celebrated more as a fun, community event rather than a sugary free-for-all. \"It shouldn't be about the candy,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some also suggest that people should put the greed factor into perspective. That's the view of Lizzie LeBontemps, an artist who has made a specialty of Halloween songs. She notes there are still plenty of grateful trick-or-treaters out there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I get rude, greedy kids every single year - and also every single year, I get polite, delightful ones who compliment my decorations and exclaim with a delighted 'Thank you!' when I hand them treats,\" LeBontemps said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada's economy remains weak but looks to have avoided back-to-back quarterly contractions, with a modest recovery in industry-level activity as the country comes to grips with the uncertainty of U.S. trade policy and tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Data from the national statistics agency shows gross domestic product unexpectedly fell in August, the fourth decline in five months and after upwardly revised growth the month before. Its advance estimate indicates a modest rise in output in September. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That suggests the economy grew 0.4% on an annualized basis in the latest quarter, a recovery after shrinking in the second quarter and close to the Bank of Canada's forecast for modest growth of 0.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Amid U.S. protectionism and the Trump administration's changing levies on imported goods, businesses in Canada have been forced to adapt to weakened demand and higher costs. The fallout has been particularly hard on trade-exposed sectors like manufacturing, though there have been signs the impact of the trade conflict is widening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canadian GDP, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy, declined 0.3% from the month before in August, Statistics Canada said Friday. Economists had been expecting flat activity, and the data agency's earlier flash estimate pointed to essentially unchanged industry-level activity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  GDP for July was revised upward to growth of 0.3%, the first expansion in four months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The agency's early estimate indicates GDP in September edged up 0.1% on-month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of Canada earlier this week cut its policy interest rate a second time in a row but signaled there was a bigger hurdle to any further easing as it balances risks to inflation against a recovery in the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central bank expects sluggish growth in the second half of 2025, held back by weak export volumes, uncertainty and Ottawa's efforts to slow immigration. Still, that would mean the country escapes a recession, marked by consecutive quarterly contractions, after GDP fell 1.6% annualized in the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Statistics Canada's early look at September indicates increases in finance and insurance, mining and oil and gas extraction, and manufacturing. These were partially offset by declines in wholesale and retail trade. The estimate is set to be updated Nov. 28, when official quarterly GDP figures will be released. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Industry accounts for August showed goods producing industries in particular struggled, with a fifth contraction since the beginning of the year. Services-producing sectors edged down, for the first decline in six months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Mining activity weakened, driven by falls in metal ore and coal, and rigging and drilling activity fell sharply. Oil and gas extraction tempered the decline, growing for a third month straight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canada's utilities sector weakened for the month, as a worsening drought continued to hamper hydroelectric power generation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Manufacturing in August faced broad declines, including in food production, machinery manufacturing and fabricated metal product making. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A strike by roughly 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants that began mid-month and led to flight cancellations dented air travel in August, and meant transportation activity overall fell for the first time in six months. Pipeline transportation also was lower, driven by lower natural gas activity that coincided with a drop in exports to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Wholesale trade in August declined for the first month in four, but retail trade saw widespread expansion, including increases at motor vehicle and parts dealers and at clothing and accessories stores. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Statistics Canada recently estimated retail sales, which have choppy for months, fell in September, while lower sales of machinery equipment and supplies likely meant wholesale sales were down slightly. An advance tally of factory trade indicated manufacturing sales climbed 2.8% month-over-month to reverse weakness in August. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"The weakness we are seeing in the Canadian economy is more than a cyclical downturn. It is also a structural transition,\" Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said this week, adding it was now harder to do business with the U.S., which has destroyed some of Canada's capacity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sector-specific U.S. tariffs continue to weigh on exports of motor vehicles, steel and aluminum, and more recent levies are expected to affect Canada's copper, furniture and softwood lumber. They also add to challenges for Canadian agriculture from Chinese tariffs on canola, peas, pork and seafood. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  President Trump last Thursday said he was cutting off trade talks with Canada and followed with a threatened additional 10% tariff on the country in response to an ad campaign that he said misrepresented comments by former President Ronald Reagan. American tariffs on Canada currently stand at 35%, with energy products at 10%, though goods that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement are carved-out of the duties. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.
