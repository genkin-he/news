Exxon and Chevron are slated to report earnings on Friday, after a string of upbeat quarters for the two integrated giants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are slated to report quarterly earnings before the bell Friday. They've posted better profits and revenues in the past several quarters, but today's financial snapshots could be different. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron (CVX) has beaten per-share profit estimates for the past two quarters. Exxon (XOM) has done the same for the past five quarters. Both of them beat on revenue in the last quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But earnings are likely to be weaker this time around, given commodities prices, Morningstar analyst Allen Good said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. oil futures prices (CL.1) are down nearly 3% so far this month, and have fallen nearly 16% year to date. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's because of a slowdown in demand amid concerns about further economic pain, which would lessen the need for oil, and rising production quotas from the world's top oil-producing countries since this spring. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are plenty of worries that oil prices may be headed to their lowest since the pandemic. A World Bank report this week pointed to an oil supply glut brewing for next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts polled by FactSet expect Chevron to report adjusted earnings of $1.71 a share on sales of $47.3 billion. That would compare with third-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.51 on sales of $50.7 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For Exxon, the analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.82 on sales of $86.5 billion. That would be down from the year-ago results of $1.92 in adjusted EPS on sales of $90 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The integrated giants are not the same companies they were a decade ago, with management that is more disciplined and shying away from boom-and-bust cycles, Allen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They have improved their balance sheet and shown capital discipline,\" he said. \"They are still showing relatively strong returns and balance sheets, and they are not overextended.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Their stock trajectories this year seem to support that distinction. Exxon shares are holding on to a 7% gain so far in 2025, while Chevron shares are flat. However, they have underperformed the broader equity market, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX gaining about 16% so far this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 05:37 ET (09:37 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
