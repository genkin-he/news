The update follows Onco-Innovations' CEO Thomas O'Shaughnessy's recent appearance on Cboe Canada's Investor Spotlight (October 22, 2025), where he discussed Onco's mission to enhance cancer treatment technologies through innovation, AI-driven research, and strategic growth initiatives.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Over the past several months, Onco has achieved a series of milestones that have strengthened its scientific and operational foundation, including: acquiring Inka Health AI in February 2025, moving its stock listing to the Cboe Canada Market, partnering with Dalton Pharma Services in May 2025, entering into continued collaboration with the University of Alberta and the Cross Cancer Institute in June 2025, signing an agreement with Nucro-Technics in July 2025 and entering into a start-up agreement with Avance Clinical Pty Ltd, all furthering Onco's research and development efforts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Building on the progress achieved throughout 2025, Onco is now focused on advancing its programs toward clinical evaluation and strengthening its position in the capital markets. The Company continues to lay the groundwork for a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2026, which would mark a transition from preclinical research and testing to clinical translation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In the Cboe Spotlight interview, Mr. O'Shaughnessy reflected upon the Company's intention to pursue a U.S. strategy that focuses on enhancing the Company's U.S. presence, including through the pursuit of a U.S. stock exchange cross-listing in 2026. The Company believes that a cross-listing could enhance shareholder value by expanding access to a wider base of potential institutional and retail investors. Additionally, the greater exposure to U.S. capital markets generally would be expected to strengthen engagement with the North American research and development community, supporting Onco's long-term growth trajectory.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">The groundwork we have laid over the past several months has positioned us to move decisively into clinical development. We are now entering an exciting phase where our focus evolves from preclinical success to preparing for clinical validation. Our near-term priorities include completing the necessary steps for our first-in-human trial and advancing our U.S. strategy, both of which will be key drivers of our next stage of growth,</em>\" stated Thomas O'Shaughnessy, CEO of Onco-Innovations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Onco-Innovations Limited</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Onco-Innovations is a Canadian-based company dedicated to cancer research and treatment, specializing in oncology.

I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I'm in the home stretch': I'm 80.
