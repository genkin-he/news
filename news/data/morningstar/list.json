Together, these factors position AgriBank to continue providing reliable funding and financial solutions to our Farm Credit Association‑owners as they support farmers, ranchers, and rural communities through challenging economic and market conditions.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">2025</strong><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\"> Results of Operations</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Net interest income was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $143.8 million, or 13.5 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher spread income on retail loans in AgriBank's asset pool portfolio and on AgriBank's wholesale loan portfolio due to an increase in volume. These factors were somewhat offset by decreased spread income on investment securities due to the mix of investment securities. The benefit of equity financing in net interest income increased compared to the prior year, due to higher levels of equity partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Equity financing represents the benefit of non-interest bearing funding. With interest rates moving lower during the second half of 2025, opportunities were taken to call and refinance debt at lower levels. While some loans have followed this pattern, the repricing or conversion of loans has been slower, resulting in wider retail interest rate spreads.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Non-interest income was $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $5.0 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily related to an increase in loan fees due to marginally higher conversion and commitment fees generating additional income during the year. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by the reduction in mineral income related to lower oil prices.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Non-interest expense was $235.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million, or 8.8 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly due to dealer incentive expenses related to AgriBank's crop input financing portfolio. Loan servicing expense increased due to asset pool activity during 2025 and the second half of 2024. Additionally, contractor fees added to increased purchased services expense related to additional resources for technology projects during the year.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Loan Portfolio</strong> </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Total loans were $177.9 billion at December 31, 2025, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 8.0 percent, compared to December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to wholesale loan growth and increases in retail loans from expanded participation in asset pool programs.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">AgriBank's credit quality reflects the overall financial strength of District Associations and their underlying portfolios of retail loans. AgriBank's portfolio was composed of 99.2 percent acceptable loans at December 31, 2025, compared to 99.4 percent at December 31, 2024. Loans classified as acceptable represent the highest-quality assets. The credit quality of AgriBank's retail loan portfolio decreased slightly to 94.9 percent classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025, compared to 95.7 percent acceptable at December 31, 2024.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Agricultural Conditions</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">On February 5, 2026, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) released its initial forecast of the U.S. aggregate farm income and financial conditions for 2026 and updated its 2025 forecast. The revised 2025 net farm income forecast of $154.5 billion represents a $27.0 billion increase from the 2024 level, up 21.2 percent, driven by increasing direct government payments and animal and animal product cash receipts, which more than offset rising expenses. When adjusting for inflation, the 2025 net farm income forecast is $28.4 billion, or 22.0 percent, above the 10-year average (2015-2024) net farm income in 2026 dollars. The initial 2026 net farm income projection of $153.4 billion represents a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, from the revised 2025 net farm income forecast, and if realized, would be $24.3 billion, or 18.8 percent, above the 10-year average net farm income in 2026 dollars.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Many factors, including weather, trade, government and monetary policy, global agricultural production levels, and pathogenic outbreaks in livestock and poultry, may keep agriculture market volatility elevated. Implementation of cost-saving technologies, marketing methods, and risk management strategies will continue to cause a wide range of results among the respective agricultural producers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Capital Resources</strong> <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">and Liquidity</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Total capital remained strong at $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2025, an increase of $1.0 billion compared to December 31, 2024. The increase was driven by AgriBank's strong net income and the issuance of capital stock, which were partially offset by cash patronage declared, consistent with AgriBank's capital plan. AgriBank exceeded all regulatory capital minimum requirements, including additional regulatory buffers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $25.4 billion and $25.1 billion at December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. AgriBank's end-of-the-period liquidity position represented 147 days coverage of maturing debt obligations, which supports operational demands, and was well above the 90-day minimum established by AgriBank's regulator.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About AgriBank </strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">AgriBank is part of the customer-owned, nationwide Farm Credit System.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His lawyer said, 'He's gone off the deep end' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The lawyer's last words to us was we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My sister and I have held power of attorney for my brother, who lives six hours away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He has been in an assisted-living facility for over three years. Physically, he is not able to live independently, but was or is pretty sharp mentally. We take care of all his bills; his house and car were sold over three years ago. His wife died in 2020; they had no children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 10 days, he started calling my sister about bills he needed to pay; all his bills are being paid by her. He also wants to know the balance in his bank accounts. My sister has always given him this information when he asks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He wanted to see the lawyer recently. He was very paranoid, asking staff to witness their conversation. He doesn't remember that he sold his house or car. In an email, his lawyer said, \"He's gone off the deep end.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lawyer's last words to us were we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate. My sister and I are his only family, the will is made and we would inherit his estate. What do we do next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Other Sibling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Sibling, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not encouraged by the tone or content of his attorney's email. It lacks compassion, professionalism and respect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother is confused and needs help. But he doesn't need an executor. An executor is appointed by the probate court after your brother passes away (and would typically be designated executor in his will). A power of attorney usually looks after a person's finances while they have diminished capacity; a durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. A conservator/guardian would be appointed by the courts to oversee his financial, physical and medical wellbeing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Take immediate steps to safeguard your brother's safety: He may need an assessment for dementia or cognitive impairment from a neurologist or geriatrician. I hope that the assisted-living facility is aware of this change of behavior, and is equipped to help him navigate this next stage. You will all need to work together until you figure out the next steps for your brother. Questions remain: What kind of power of attorney document currently exists? What legal capacity does your brother have to make decisions for himself - everything from hiring a new lawyer to revoking a POA? Has your brother been actually diagnosed with dementia? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, you will require health advocates and a competent lawyer. If the lawyer mentioned in your letter is not equipped to deal with your brother's situation - and it could be so given his reaction to the decline in your brother's health - you need a new lawyer to oversee your brother's affairs; as his joint powers of attorney, you can help him to appoint one. They will be able to help outline your options, which will depend on what kind of POA you hold and whether or not your brother requires conservatorship/guardianship, which should be a last resort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Laws regarding a conservator/guardian vary by state. In Texas, you would need to file a petition with the court. \"A hearing will be held, and the judge will examine the evidence and make a decision,\" says Childs Legacy Law Firm in Houston. \"In the second instance, absent a pending petition, and in lieu of a family member, living will or another relevant document, the court will appoint a conservator. The conservator can be any number of people, like a friend, social worker, neighbor, church member, attorney, nurse [or] another qualified person.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     General conservatorship </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A general conservatorship is created when an adult - typically an elderly person but can be a younger adult person - cannot manage their finances or health due to deteriorated mental capacity or impairment caused by an illness or injury,\" it adds. \"While they recover from the illness or injury, a conservator may be appointed by a court to address their medical and financial needs.\" Reasons include a person falling into a coma, a form of dementia like Alzheimer's, head injury or a stroke that impairs their ability to think or express their wishes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating, quite suddenly. \"People who suffer from any of the above can become vulnerable to bad actors who may try to manipulate the situation for their own financial gain. These bad actors may, for example, attempt to divert your disability payments (fraud) or coerce you into changing a will (undue influence),\" the law firm says. It is always better to draft an estate plan while you have the legal capacity to write and sign such a document. Otherwise, it will be left up to the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating. He needs calm and legal protection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, your brother needs reassurance and validation, clear and comforting communication, a routine so he feels safe, and legal protection; document everything, especially his changes in behavior. If he does not already have a healthcare proxy or healthcare power of attorney, and your brother is not of sound mind, the courts will appoint one for him. If he is in assisted living, for example, there may come a time when you will have to move him to a full-time care facility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the absence of long-term-care insurance or Medicaid, I assume you will use (or have used) the proceeds from the sale of his house to pay for his care. Selling a primary residence turns the home's equity from an exempt asset into countable cash, which often exceeds the strict monthly $2,000-$3,000 individual limit for Medicaid, which would lead to a temporary loss of benefits until those funds are spent. A trust and estate attorney can talk through your options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can do this. But you can't - nor should you - do it alone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am fearful': My ailing relative is being forced into assisted living.
