The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how it was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope rather than an electronic transfer - and I'm not sure I need or want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect any alleged money laundering; it does not mean that you have done anything wrong, as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong. In other words, there should be a paper trail if/when you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? That's \"structuring\" and it's illegal. This occurs if you deliberately break up financial transactions to avoid triggering mandatory reports required by law. Authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a fine-tooth comb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor and/or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of the death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax vs. estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As you note, only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source, and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent might the bank request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jobless claims show most companies are avoiding big layoffs </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some companies are hiring, but finding a job is not easy these days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market appears here to stay - at least in 2026. Most CEOs of U.S. companies say they have no plans to increase the size of their workforce this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The number of people being hired slowed sharply in 2026 to one of the lowest levels in more than a decade amid a burst of uncertainty triggered by high U.S. tariffs and the rapid evolvement of artificial intelligence as a potential labor-saving tool. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, most companies have refrained from widespread layoffs given a chronic shortage of skilled workers. Sales have also been strong enough to retain current staff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Economists have called this a \"low-hire, low-fire\" job market. The latest weekly report on jobless claims bears out this trend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Initial jobless claims rose by 4,000 to 212,000 in the seven days that ended Feb. 21, the government said. That's an exceedingly low level historically and reflects how few layoffs are taking place in the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bad news? The labor market is unlikely to see much improvement this year, based on a new survey of the CEOs of America's largest companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fewer  than one-third of business leaders say they plan to beef up their workforce anytime soon, the Conference Board reported Thursday. And some 41% say they plan to keep staff at current levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only 28% say they might reduce employment, the nonprofit board said in its quarterly survey of CEOs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lack of layoffs has been a key driver of the five-year-old economic expansion. Most people who want a job have one, and their spending continues to propel the economy forward. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If bad times were coming, rising jobless claims would be one of the earliest warning signs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Key details: The number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, fell by 31,000 to 1.83 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Remarkably, continuing claims are lower now than they were one year ago, a sign the labor market is no longer getting any worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These claims had risen steadily for several years and reached a high of almost 2 million last fall before tapering off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The labor-market data has been quite a bit better recently,\" Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran said Thursday on Fox Business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big picture: Barring a recession, the U.S. job market probably can't get much worse after a rough 2025. The U.S. only added 181,000 new jobs last year, the smallest increase in any year the economy was not in recession since 2003. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bright side? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEOs are more optimistic about the economy, and a majority expect their businesses will improve in the next six months. If the economy accelerates, it would likely lead to more hiring than expected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Looking ahead: \"There is no sign of layoffs picking up. Hiring remains anemic, but the labor market is not getting worse and is showing many signs of stabilizing,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&amp;P 500 SPX were set to rise slightly in Thursday trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Primerica, Inc. (Primerica) (headquartered in Duluth, GA) [NYSE: PRI], which is the holding company for the group’s insurance and non-insurance operating companies. AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) on $600 million, 2.8% senior unsecured notes, due 2031, of Primerica. The outlook of all these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Primerica Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica’s credit ratings continue to recognize the group’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s balance sheet remains a core strength, characterized by strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Primerica has an investment profile that focuses on fixed-income assets, while maintaining only modest exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, the company’s business model does rely heavily on the use of reinsurance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica reinforced its position as an industry leader, consistently reporting high levels of earnings and top-tier return-on-equity measures among its peers. Steady premium growth, fueled by a vast and geographically diversified distribution system spanning the U.S. and Canadian marketplaces, continues to improve the company's operational strength. Primerica has extensive agent recruitment and a well-established monitoring system to ensure compliance and steady premium growth. Primerica’s use of highly rated reinsurance partners mitigates term life insurance mortality risk, a core component of its strong balance sheet management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe group’s business profile is focused on its core term life insurance offering, particularly the investments made in its simplified issue product. Beyond the Primerica Group, Primerica also offers the distribution of primarily third-party investment and savings products and other non-life products.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

As the field pushes to identify therapies that truly slow or halt progression but struggle to produce clear, reproducible neuroprotection signals, NeuraLight’s neuroprogression biomarkers provide a highly sensitive functional endpoint capable of detecting meaningful changes in disease trajectory.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThis development is timely given the building momentum around promising approaches such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, in which the therapeutic potential is compelling but definitive proof of neuroprotection remains challenging.

The platform is used across thousands of patients in programs spanning Parkinson’s disease, ALS, MS, PSP, MSA and Huntington’s disease.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nNeuraLight will exhibit at Booth #4 at the AD/PD 2026 Startup Hub in Copenhagen.
