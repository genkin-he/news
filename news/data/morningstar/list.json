In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree.'Hemant Taneja </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hemant Taneja is a venture capitalist, author and CEO of General Catalyst, recognized for his insights into how artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and economies. Taneja was an early investor in companies including Stripe, Snap (SNAP), Grammarly and Anduril, with a focus on applied AI, healthcare transformation and responsible innovation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His new book, \"The Transformation Principles: How to Create Enduring Change\" (co-authored with Kevin Maney), outlines nine principles for companies and managers to create sustainable change. Under Taneja's leadership, General Catalyst has raised billions of dollars while emphasizing ethical AI deployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In this recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Taneja discusses how individuals and companies can transform themselves, notes AI stocks with growth potential, and explains AI's huge risk and major opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What's the central message of your new book, and why is it timely now? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: We are entering a technology cycle where AI is going to be a transformative force, and it's going to transform many industries. There is an opportunity to actually make capitalism work for everybody if we make the right intentional choices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What does a company need to do to have a successful transformation through AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: For an organization to be transformative, it needs to have a culture of curiosity and generosity. They need to transform, but not disrupt. Disruption is the alternative to transformation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Should an individual begin transforming themselves today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: You have to. Steve Jobs said that first we have to change ourselves, then we change our industry, and then we change the world. We have to transform ourselves to deliver greater value and then gain the ability to transform the industries that we work in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Is AI going to be more transformative than the internet? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: It will be bigger. When the internet came, it was all about making things more efficient, but humans were still doing the work and software was making them more efficient. With AI, you're basically saying it will do the same job as a human for the most part. When ChatGPT first arrived, every CEO in every industry and in every country was thinking about what to do with it. It was the first time a technology hit the zeitgeist across the entire world at the same time (i.e., it became a global cultural phenomenon). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Many employees fear that AI means job loss. How can leaders introduce it in a way that builds trust and gets people on board? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: Change is scary for a lot of people, which is why trust matters. If AI people came into your company and said to your employees, \"We are going to transform your business,\" the natural response is that you're going to kill their jobs. That's because you didn't take the time to build trust. Instead, tell them, \"We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.\" They would embrace it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Which companies are getting AI adoption right today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: In my book I talked about companies such as Applied Intuition, Hippocratic AI, Stripe and Commure. Some of the AI model companies are obviously doing very well. If you look at the consensus, it would be OpenAI and Anthropic. There are also open-source companies, such as Mistral, that are building AI models that are quite interesting. There are also companies that are imagining modern call centers, the evolution of the legal department, how accounting is being done with AI, how marketing and sales are going to be done using AI, and how to empower sales reps. Those types of companies are going to be very, very interesting over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest risks of AI adoption? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja:  We are going to transition from a culture of solving problems to a culture of asking questions, which will be a big transition. We want to make sure we're not losing our cognitive capabilities, our ability to think, and our ability to solve problems. How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? There is a trap you can fall into, whereas these technologies get better and better, and you stop thinking. Think about how to get from point A to point B today. People turn on the map program and lose all touch of how things are laid out physically. You don't want that to happen to all concepts in your brain. It is a downside if we become too reliant and give up sharpening our own cognitive skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What are the key steps leaders must take to successfully integrate AI into their organizations? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There are four steps leaders must take to make AI work: First, they have to change their data infrastructure and their IT (information technology) department so they can adopt AI. Then they must train them with the data. Next, they have to change their workforce because they now have humans and AI working together. What a lot of CEOs got wrong is they didn't realize that the only way a profound change will happen in their company is if they demonstrate courage and conviction. They have to encourage their people to take risks and show them how it will make them more successful. Otherwise, people get scared, and they won't use it. That's how a lot of organizations get stuck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What is the biggest cautionary lesson leaders should keep in mind as they adopt AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There will always be those who use AI for societal harm. We have to trust the system to build the right guardrails. Over time, this technology will be properly regulated in terms of who gets access to it and how it gets applied. Like any new technology, it could be bumpy. I have an optimistic view that human beings will find a way to leverage these profound technologies for good in the aggregate, such as what happened with nuclear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: With AI reshaping so many industries, how can employees protect their careers and make sure they thrive in an AI-driven workplace? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: The most concrete and useful advice I can give is to learn how to adopt AI to do your job more effectively. That's really what you should be doing. This means asking the right questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and being more strategic in your own work. It's a huge opportunity for employees. In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What guidance would you give recent graduates entering today's fast-changing job market? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: To understand that the world is going to change a lot in the next few years. When kids used to graduate 10 years ago, they would list all the software they knew how to use on their resume. Now we're in a world where that software is changing every three months, and you're constantly having to learn and keep up to be effective at your job. Being a lifelong learner is important. The world is an empty canvas. Let's have AI shape the world to be what we want it to be. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Looking ahead, how do you see AI reshaping society and business in the years to come? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: AI is a transformative force, and we have an amazing opportunity in front of us to transform society, to transform nations, to transform industries, and to transform our own business with AI with this mindset of abundance, of building companies that are truly focused on purpose and profit. We need to find the ingredients required to be able to build companies that can be agents of such transformations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Sincere is the author of several books, including \"Understanding Stocks,\" \"Understanding Options,\" and \"Help Your Child Build Wealth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: The AI boom is over - here's your bubble survival guide </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Michael Sincere </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The government shut down, which is barreling towards a record, has forced federal workers to miss paychecks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The government shutdown is poised to mark a major milestone next week in the absence of a deal, as the partial closure heads towards the longest on record. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From workers skipping paychecks to missing economic data causing the Federal Reserve to fly partially blind in its decision making, the effects of the shutdown are being increasingly felt throughout the U.S. economy. And as of Saturday morning, there's no end in sight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The pressure is only likely to grow. Food-stamp benefits were scheduled to expire Saturday, yet on Friday afternoon, federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay them. Meanwhile,  millions of Americans who buy plans under the Affordable Care Act may start enrolling in their health insurance Saturday. But without the subsidies at the heart of the shutdown battle, many are in for sticker shock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown would become the country's most prolonged on Tuesday night, eclipsing the 35-day shutdown that stretched from December 2018 to January 2019. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's a closer look at some of the key issues around the shutdown, and what could force its end. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The coming air travel 'disaster' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Holiday air travel is rapidly approaching, and with Thanksgiving flights in sight, some see a \"disaster\" in the making if the shutdown doesn't end. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That was the word choice of Vice President JD Vance, who met on Thursday with U.S. airline executives. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Invoking the paychecks missed by federal workers like air-traffic controllers, Vance said: \"How many of them are not going to show up for work?\" after missing multiple checks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Airlines themselves chimed in, with United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL) and Delta Airlines Inc. (DAL) urging lawmakers to end the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read on: Air-traffic controllers miss their first paycheck. The shutdown's effects on airports are getting worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Food-stamp stress </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Funding for Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, was set to lapse Saturday before the judges' order to tap emergency accounts to pay for them. Around 40 million people receive food stamps, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and without the aid, Americans would need to turn to programs like community food pantries. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The judges gave the White House leeway on whether to fund SNAP partially or in full for November, according to the Associated Press. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a social-media post late Friday, President Donald Trump suggested the government would comply with the rulings, but said more clarity was needed from the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,\" he said in a post on Truth Social. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not just consumers and families that would be affected by an interruption in SNAP benefits. There's a potential hit to the U.S. economy as well, in the form of depleted spending. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The $8 billion paid in monthly SNAP benefits represents around 10% of retail grocery sales, though the impact won't be limited to groceries as households are more likely to substitute away from other retail categories to find cash to allocate to food spending,\" said analysts at RBC Economics in a note on Thursday. \"This represents a sizable risk that retail sales and broader consumption will slow in Q4 as a result.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Department of Agriculture said ahead of the shutdown it would pay the SNAP benefits using emergency funding, then later said such funding wasn't \"legally available.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now read: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Obamacare could force action </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The threat of sharply rising health insurance premiums may serve to end the shutdown, though to date the parties remain far apart. The end of subsidies for plans bought under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will become more apparent as open enrollment begins for those plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Higher premiums won't kick in until after Dec. 31. Americans also have already been getting letters from their insurers revealing their higher rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But some see Obamacare as forcing a deal, along with the expiration of SNAP benefits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Given the Nov. 1 action-forcing catalysts of SNAP benefit delays &amp; ACA Open Enrollment, we believe resolution on the shutdown is likely by Nov. 14,\" said Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, in a note on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He predicted a one-year Obamacare subsidy extension is likely and added that reforms could be made for the following year for involving things like income caps. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Banks like Chase, Capital One are offering financial help to customers affected by the shutdown. Here are the potential downsides. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Election aftermath </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown's length milestone and Election Day could collide on Tuesday, thrusting the federal closure into the spotlight anew and perhaps provoking a fresh push to end it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Voters in New Jersey and Virginia will choose governors, in some of the more closely watched races. Wins by Democrats could give them \"an opportunity to claim victory by proclaiming that support for their healthcare messaging and shutdown tactics helped fuel the party's victories at the ballot box,\" Christopher Niebuhr of Beacon Policy Advisors recently wrote. That would \"cushion the blow of folding in the government shutdown fight.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But it's \"also possible that resounding victories in the November 4th elections and the launch of the ACA's open-enrollment period will only strengthen the party's resolve,\" said Niebuhr. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Victor Reklaitis contributed . </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Robert Schroeder </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

I made a choice based on the information given, but I admit published IRA rules and the Secure Act 2.0 left me confused about which was the best choice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative told me that I would be able to change my choice if I was not satisfied. After mulling things over, I felt I wanted to change my choice but when I called back I was told by another representative presumably higher up the food chain that this was not so. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given that all conversations were on a recorded line, I requested a copy of the pertinent conversations regarding this matter. I was told they did not provide copies of these conversations. Is this another thing in life we need to get a lawyer for? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your thoughts please. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bamboozled Beneficiary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: I'm in my 70s. Should I take the tax hit and withdraw all of my inherited IRA to avoid required minimum distributions? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Bamboozled, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As if a personal loss leading to an inherited account wasn't enough, financial headaches make the situation all the more stressful. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're right in that inherited account options, as well as many other retirement plan decisions, are complicated, and the published rules or changes under any new law do not always make them easier to understand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, let's review the options for a spouse who inherits an IRA. The two main avenues are rolling the money over into an IRA in the inheritor's own name or transferring the assets to an inherited IRA, though someone could also either take a lump-sum distribution or disclaim the assets if they so wished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spouses get to do the option to roll over the money into an IRA under their own name. They can use a new or existing IRA. This option can be quite tax-advantageous, especially if you don't need the money anytime soon and are not close to the current RMD age, which is 73 years old. For instance, if your spouse had already reached 73 but you haven't, you don't have to take those required minimum distributions even if your spouse had taken them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about retirement, Social Security, where to live or how to afford it at all? We want to hear from you. Join the conversation in our Facebook community: Retire Better with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are caveats, however. If your wife was taking RMDs before but hadn't in the year of her death, you would have to do so now. \"This RMD is calculated based on the longer of the remaining life expectancy or your spouse's single-life expectancy,\" according to Fidelity Investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another caveat: If you're under 59 1/2 years old and you do end up needing to draw down some of that money, you'd be hit with a 10% penalty if the money is in an account under your name before you reach that age for penalty-free distributions. However, you could convert the money to a Roth account after rolling it into an account under your name. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The second avenue is to transfer the money into an inherited IRA, which would avoid that 10% penalty for distributions for those under 59 1/2 years old. With this option, you either can begin RMDs in the year after the year of death or you can wait until the year in which your wife would have turned 73. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The starting date depends on whether your wife was of RMD age. If she was taking her RMDs, you would have to take the RMD for the year if she hadn't done so yet, and then you can begin taking RMDs based on your life expectancy in the year after the year of her death, and thereafter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If your wife had not yet reached her RMD age, then you can either take the RMD by Dec. 31 of the year after the year of death or, if later, by the end of the year that your wife would have reached her RMD age. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can always decide to go from an inherited spouse IRA to your own IRA down the road,\" Stephen Maggard, a certified financial planner at Abacus Planning Group. The reverse, however, is not possible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lawyering up </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Getting attorneys involved can bring along its own stresses, as well as costs, so you should only do so if you're sure that you have suffered financial damage and you believe you could get something out of the whole process. Before doing so, try sending the firm a written request for the recorded call. Alternatively, an attorney might be able to get a hold of that recorded call with a subpoena. However, many businesses do not provide copies of recorded conversations unless they receive a subpoena, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to HG.org, an online legal resource. \"A subpoena is a request for certain documents to be produced, usually made by an attorney who is representing a client in a pending case who believes that the information requested will prove or disprove a component of the case.\" If a business fails to comply when it does not have a defense, it adds, the party can be subject to civil or criminal penalties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide not to use an attorney, but you still want to try and get a hold of that recording, you can file a complaint with regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or your state regulator. Make sure you have all of your facts straight - as much detail as you can remember about what the representative told you, and the options made available to you, and all relevant documentation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By submitting your story to Dow Jones &amp; Co., the publisher of MarketWatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Have a question about your own retirement savings?

These statements caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase and/or acquire VFC's securities at artificially inflated prices.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The truth emerged on May 21, 2025, when VFC reported its fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results, highlighting a significant decline in Vans' growth trajectory, which faltered from an 8% loss the quarter before to a 20% loss in the fourth quarter, and noting such decline would continue through the next quarter. The Company attributed its results and below-expectation guidance largely as \"a direct effect of deliberately reduced revenue to eliminate unprofitable or unproductive businesses\" and \"an additional set of deliberate actions\" already in-place but previously unannounced. VFC further noted that, disregarding these deliberate actions, Vans would still have shown a \"high single digit[]\" revenue decline, suggesting growth slowed in comparison to the prior years' sequential improvements irrespective of management's new \"deliberate actions.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Investors and analysts reacted immediately to VFC's revelation. The price of VFC's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $14.43 per share on May 20, 2025, VFC's stock price fell to $12.15 per share on May 21, 2025, a decline of about 15.8% in the span of just a single day.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The economy is still afloat in an ocean of uncertainty </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Is the sun setting on the U.S. economy? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors are set to miss out on the second U.S. jobs report in a row due to the government shutdown, but there's enough scattered evidence to suggest the economy is hanging in there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the shutdown now passing the one-month mark, the U.S. Labor Department probably won't be able to publish the October employment report next Friday as scheduled. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The second postponed jobs report in a row has made it hard for investors and senior Federal Reserve officials to figure out if the economy is getting better or worse. Hiring had almost grinded to a halt by the end of summer, alarming the Fed enough to push the central bank to start cutting interest rates again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Absent the usual signposts, Wall Street has had to turn to other indicators such as credit-card spending, corporate earning results and state jobless claims to try to piece together what is going on. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What they show is an economy that's still expanding even amid a cloud of uncertainty - the shutdown, trade wars, the sharp slowdown in hiring. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Let's start with credit-card spending. Bank of America found that weekly spending was up almost 1% in the seven days ended Oct. 25 compared to the same period a week earlier. Not great, but not bad either. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial, said customers in the 15 states in which the bank has branches continue to spend at a similar pace as before the government shutdown. \"So far I haven't found anything at odds,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Business spending, meanwhile, has also held up well, largely because of the ongoing boom in investment in artificial intelligence. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) all said this week that they would ramp up AI investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A big reason why they can invest more is because sales and profits remain quite healthy, a testament in part to solid consumer spending. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The latest round of [quarterly corporate] earnings reports don't suggest an economy that is about to roll over,\" Moody said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve on Wednesday also seemed to suggest the economy may have improved a bit since late summer. While the Fed still cut interest rates because of worries about a soft labor market, senior officials also sounded an optimistic note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The economy is showing continued momentum. Consumption remains solid,\" said Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed. He was the lone dissenter who preferred no rate cut given the residual strength of the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The risk of recession is not on \"people's minds,\" added Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Fed officials would dearly love to see the monthly employment reports resume to get a more realistic appraisal of the economy. Now they have to look at alternative or lesser measures to guide their decisions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for his part, took comfort in data showing new applications for unemployment benefits remain low. He also noted that private-sector surveys of job openings were stable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We are not seeing an uptick in jobless claims or a downtick, really, in [job] openings,\" Powell said on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The resilience of the economy and a seeming stable, if softer, labor market helps to explain why Powell went out of his way to say another rate cut in December is not a \"foregone conclusion - far from it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some Wall Street firms even think the economy will pick up a bit of steam at year-end.

Management will be looking to convince investors that the company's chips are resonating, beyond a recent 6-gigawatt agreement with OpenAI that won't become much of a factor until the latter part of next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While the OpenAI deal is focused on next-generation chips, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri will be watching trends in the current MI355x line as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Our sense is that, following the initial tool-up in [the second half], many customers seem to be pausing on MI355x and waiting for MI455 racks next year - not a huge issue, but something we think about given the recent rally in shares after signing the [OpenAI] deal,\" Arcuri wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's why OpenAI wants a stake in AMD </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's also interested in how customers are viewing AMD's graphics processing units relative to application-specific integrated circuits from Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Companies are diversifying beyond Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), but when it comes to Nvidia alternatives, \"recently things seem to have tilted in favor of ASICs,\" Arcuri noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Google shows off its semiconductor prowess with a new Anthropic deal </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That said, there's more to AMD's business than AI accelerators. \"No one really talks about servers as much as they do accelerators, but the server business has bounced back pretty nicely,\" Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the company's last earnings call, Chief Executive Lisa Su said that AMD's businesses of selling central processing units for servers and personal computers were \"accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio and expanded go-to-market investments.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"All of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well,\" she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How much AMD's earnings will move the stock remains to be seen, since so much of its recent momentum stems from business that's farther out than the present day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But for now, the setup into the print as a result admittedly looks solid; core markets (PCs, servers) are looking better in the near term, they continue to take oodles of share, and as the OpenAI ramp doesn't even start for a year, a tremendous amount of pressure has probably been removed from any nearer-term AI expectations,\" Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon wrote recently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rasgon asked whether anyone would really care if AMD missed AI expectations for the fourth quarter, given the magnitude of what lies ahead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Can AMD's stock live up to the hype? Depends on how you look at it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In looking at overall third-quarter expectations, analysts tracked by FactSet are calling for $1.17 in adjusted earnings per share on revenue of $8.8 billion. For the fourth quarter, the consensus view calls for $1.32 in adjusted EPS and $9.2 billion in total revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This also won't be the only time investors are hearing from management in the near future, as the company is due to host an investor day on Nov. 11. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We think AMD may opt to hold off on big news until then,\" Arcuri wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
