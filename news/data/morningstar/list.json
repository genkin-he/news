            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Britney Nguyen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Blockbuster earnings were anticipated as Nvidia's big customers have already indicated how much they've hiked their spending on hardware </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's stock fell after it reported a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Nvidia earns $43 billion in a quarter, does it make a sound? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Perhaps a whimper. Nvidia's stock (NVDA) is down more than 4% after Thursday's open, despite what Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore said was a historic beat-and-raise performance for a chip company. Nvidia's revenue exceeded estimates by about $3 billion, and its guidance came in roughly $5 billion above what analysts had been modeling. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That sort of beat might have been anticipated, as Nvidia's hyperscaler customers recently lifted their capital-expense forecasts, signaling a continued flood of spending on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Moore said that while the muted stock reaction is surprising, the debates hanging over Nvidia's stock \"are longer term in nature.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite the boosts to capital-expenditures forecasts, investors have been worried about the sustainability of artificial-intelligence spending, and Moore said hyperscalers' free-cash generation looks to be \"under significant pressure\" from all the investments so far. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's not so worried. Hyperscalers are asking for more compute power, he said. While the costs are a challenge, the demand is coming from a shift to inference, or running AI models, which eventually translates to revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The long term \"looks pretty good,\" Moore said in his Thursday note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Nvidia's earnings report is just a prelude to what should really matter for investors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger catalysts for Nvidia's stock may be Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming keynote at Morgan Stanley's technology conference and the chip maker's annual GTC in March, according to Moore. Investors will be looking for more details on the company's product road map, including updates on its Vera Rubin chip platform and following Feynman architecture. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said he isn't \"sure what else investors want to hear at this point,\" but buy-side expectations for Nvidia looking into 2027 seem \"very plausible\" as demand for its products shows \"zero signs of slowing.\" Specifically, he pointed to a buy-side view that $12 or more of earnings per share may be possible for Nvidia next calendar year. The FactSet consensus was for more like $10. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Nvidia has also been swept up by concerns over rising memory prices due to supply shortages. Nvidia's chips need a lot of memory, though the heavy demand for memory has helped drive industry prices higher against a tight supply backdrop. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's \"confident-but-conservative messaging on\" its 75% gross margin should be good news to investors, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said in a Wednesday note. The company likely locked in its memory supply and pricing ahead of the supply crunch, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buchalter is a bit confounded by the sluggishness of Nvidia's stock recently, as software stocks have slumped. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"To highlight just one oddity - it's odd to us that software stocks seem to be pricing existential declines while the hardware infrastructure that would enable such a future outcome is pricing a rapid decline in demand,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Nvidia is 'highly motivated' to keep investing in OpenAI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Britney Nguyen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The money is not currently in a bank account and it is not part of an estate - let's assume it's just cash in an envelope - and I live in a state with no inheritance tax. I assume I can make this deposit legally and that there are no tax consequences. Am I correct?

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how it was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope rather than an electronic transfer - and I'm not sure I need or want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect any alleged money laundering; it does not mean that you have done anything wrong, as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong. In other words, there should be a paper trail if/when you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? That's \"structuring\" and it's illegal. This occurs if you deliberately break up financial transactions to avoid triggering mandatory reports required by law. Authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a fine-tooth comb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor and/or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of the death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax vs. estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As you note, only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source, and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent might the bank request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer.
