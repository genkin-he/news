This shift over the past 25 years, aided by technological advances, is helping to meet the growing demand for transplants, the authors say.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2918263/organ_donor_data.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2918263/organ_donor_data.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">More than 100,000 Americans are currently waiting for a lifesaving transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. To address the shortage, experts have long searched for ways to safely and ethically increase the number of usable organs recovered from people who die.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new analysis traced how the deceased-donor pool has evolved because of these efforts. According to the results, circulatory-death donors climbed from 2% of all donors in 2000 to 49% of donors in 2025. Their organs are now a major source of kidneys and livers, and are increasingly used for lung, heart, and pancreas transplants. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Our findings reveal that a rise in donations after circulatory death makes organ transplantation possible for thousands of patients who might otherwise die on the waitlist,\" said study lead author Syed Ali Husain, MD, MPH.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Most donated organs historically came from people who were declared brain dead, notes Husain, an assistant professor in the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Because the heart continues to beat after brain death, their tissues continue to receive oxygen-rich blood.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">By contrast, donation after circulatory death involves donors who do not meet criteria for brain death and who cannot be kept alive without life support machines. In these cases, if the family chooses to stop life support, it is then given the option to do so in an operating room instead of the intensive care unit. If the patient dies within a set time after support is removed, organs can be recovered and used for transplantation, preserving the opportunity to donate according to the wishes of the family and the patient.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Since the organs may briefly go without oxygen and nutrients as the body shuts down and the heart stops, they were previously considered to not function as well after transplantation compared to those recovered from brain-dead donors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">During the past decade, however, new tools have helped overcome this challenge and may explain the increased use of circulatory-death donation. For example, normothermic regional perfusion temporarily restores blood flow to organs that will be donated after the heart stops, and machine perfusion devices pump nutrient- and oxygen-rich fluid through organs after removal from the body. Both approaches limit damage and make more organs suitable for transplantation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">These advances may also enable surgeons to use organs from people who would once have been excluded, the authors say. The study showed for the first time that today's circulatory-death donors tend to be older, have a higher body mass index (a measure of obesity), and are more likely to have health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure than similar donors in earlier years.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A report on the findings will be published online Feb. 26 in the <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Journal of the American Medical Association.</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For the investigation, the researchers analyzed data from the Organ Procurement &amp; Transplantation Network, which tracks every organ recovered in the U.S. They calculated the yearly share of circulatory-death donors and the resulting kidney, liver, lung, heart, and pancreas transplants. The team also assessed recovery patterns across the 55 organ procurement organizations in the U.S. — regional nonprofit agencies that coordinate donation in their assigned areas.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The researchers found that in some parts of the country, donation after circulatory death was far more common than in others, with shares ranging from as high as 73% of donors to as low as 11% of donors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Our results highlight the opportunity to further grow donation after circulatory death and save even more lives,\" said study co-senior author Dorry Segev, MD, PhD. Segev is a professor and vice chair in the Department of Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the director of the school's Center for Surgical &amp; Transplant Applied Research (CSTAR).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Clear, consistent standards for donation after circulatory death are important so patients are protected and the public is assured that the process is safe,\" said study co-senior author Babak Orandi, MD, PhD, an associate professor in the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.    </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"As donation after circulatory death becomes more common, expanded education and dialogue with patients, families, and clinicians will be essential to maintaining that trust,\" added study co-author Macey Levan, JD, PhD, an associate professor in the Departments of Surgery and Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">According to Levan, the researchers next plan to explore ways to improve donor identification and recovery practices, as well as examine how well organs from circulatory-death donors perform over time compared with those from brain-dead donors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">National Institutes of Health grant K23DK133729 provided funding for the study.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Along with Husain, Segev, Orandi, and Levan, NYU Langone researchers involved in the study are Jennifer Motter, MHS; Darren Stewart, MS; Sunjae Bae, MD, PhD; Brendan Parent, JD; Bonnie Lonze, MD, PhD; Philip Sommer, MD; Sommer Gentry, PhD; Jeffrey Stern, MD; and Allan Massie, PhD.  </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Husain has received consulting fees from the pharmaceutical company Novartis, Orandi has served on an advisory board for the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, and Stewart has received consulting fees from Hansa Biopharma.

Excluding certain items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to C$4.08 in the first quarter, topping the C$3.85 expected by analysts polled by FactSet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Total revenue rose 7.3% to C$17.96 billion, while analysts were expecting C$17.5 billion. The result was buoyed by record capital markets revenue for the quarter, asset growth in its wealth management arm, and revenue growth of 9% for personal banking and roughly 4% for commercial banking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Toronto-based lender's return on equity, a measure of profitability closely watched by analysts, expanded by 0.8 percentage point on last year to 17.6%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Household spending in Canada has remained relatively resilient despite an elevated unemployment rate and the hit to parts of the economy from the Trump administration's approach to trade policy and use of tariffs. Still, the housing market has softened in recent months and economists have warned of possible stresses on households as homeowners renew mortgages at higher interest rates. Business spending also has been relatively subdued, particularly in industries exposed to the shift toward protectionist trade policies by the U.S., even as equity markets in both Canada and the U.S. notched record highs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank in a letter to shareholders said it expects economic growth to remain positive across most advanced economies despite trade uncertainties. Canada's economy has shown signs of improvement in recent months and the jobless rate has edged lower, and the bank forecasts modest growth in the first half of the year after what was likely a flat final quarter of 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The bank, like many of its peers, projects the Bank of Canada will leave its policy interest rate steady through 2026 and it isn't anticipating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian goods to rise further, though the existing trade pact between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico is up for renegotiation this year. That backdrop, executives said, is expected to mean mortgage growth in Canada is modest this year given affordability challenges, economic uncertainty, and a pullback Canadian immigration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank's allowance for credit losses on performing loans was steady on the prior quarter, but the allowance on performing loans was increased. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Its provision for credit losses increased C$40 million year-over-year to C$1.09 billion, and was C$83 million higher than a quarter earlier. The result was above the C$1.06 billion analysts were looking for the bank to set aside against the risk of loan losses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Stephen Boland, an analyst at Raymond James in Toronto, said it was a solid quarter for Royal Bank that was again supported by markets-facing operations. He said there was a notable rise in gross impaired loans for the three months after trending lower in recent quarters, but said it wasn't overly concerning. Gross impaired loans as a percentage of loans and acceptances widened to 0.86% in the latest quarter, from 0.8% a quarter earlier and 0.78% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The bank's shares fell in early trading, underperforming the broader market in Canada, declining 1.9% to narrow the gain over the last three months to just over 8%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Like each of Canada's other big banks, Royal Bank sits on a strong capital position that has allowed it to continue buying back shares and a quarter earlier supported a lift in its dividend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 13.7% at the end of January, up 0.5 percentage point from the same quarter last year. That remains well above the at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets that Canada's banking regulator requires from the big lenders. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.

The round was led by Next Coast Ventures, with participation from S3 Ventures and UPMC Enterprises.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe funding will support the expansion of BrainCheck’s enterprise cognitive care infrastructure, including deeper workflow integration, longitudinal patient monitoring, population-scale deployment across primary care and specialty settings, and advanced AI-assisted clinical infrastructure designed for risk-bearing and value-based environments.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIn addition to technology expansion, BrainCheck is now partnering with collaborative care organizations to operationalize cognitive care delivery within practices that lack the staffing or infrastructure to execute comprehensive care workflows. These partnerships extend BrainCheck beyond assessment into structured, scalable cognitive care pathways—supporting providers with both digital tools and operational care enablement models.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs populations age and accountability for cognitive outcomes shifts toward value-based and risk-bearing models, standardized cognitive assessment is increasingly serving as the entry point to new care pathways. BrainCheck’s platform is designed to help practices identify cognitive impairment earlier and activate structured follow-up care in a sustainable, scalable manner.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Cognitive health is becoming a greater priority across the healthcare system, and the infrastructure supporting it must evolve as well,” said Mike Smerklo, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Next Coast Ventures. “BrainCheck is contributing to that evolution by bringing greater consistency, objectivity, and longitudinal insight into cognitive care. We’re excited to support the company’s next phase of growth.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“UPMC clinicians have been evaluating BrainCheck for several years and have seen firsthand how standardized digital cognitive assessment can support them in real-world practice,” said Adele Towers, M.D., M.P.H., UPMC geriatrician and senior clinical advisor to UPMC Enterprises, the innovation, commercialization, and venture capital arm of UPMC. “We look forward to our continued engagement with BrainCheck and bringing it to more clinicians supporting patients who could benefit from earlier detection, long-term monitoring, and scalable cognitive care within and beyond our health system.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck is used by more than 500 healthcare organizations nationwide, with clinicians having completed over 640,000 cognitive assessments using BrainCheck Assess™, the company’s FDA Class II digital cognitive assessment (DCA). The BrainCheck platform offers 29 validated cognitive screeners and care planning tools designed to enable standardized, repeatable measurement and longitudinal tracking, fully integrated into clinical workflows.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nTesting protocols are customizable within the BrainCheck platform and available in English and Spanish. Providers across primary care, neurology, and psychiatry use the platform to assess and monitor cognitive function and behavioral changes across a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions, with a primary focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck’s strategy centers on building structured cognitive care pathways that support:\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n• Earlier identification of cognitive risk\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• Objective, repeatable assessment over time\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• AI-assisted population health and longitudinal analysis\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• Seamless integration into health system environments and EHR systems\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• Coordination across clinical teams and care settings\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe platform is designed to reduce operational friction within time-constrained clinical environments while ensuring that interpretation and care decisions remain fully clinician-directed.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“This capital allows us to continue building tools and workflows that fit how clinicians actually practice,” said Chris Loughlin, Chief Executive Officer of BrainCheck. “We are focused on reducing friction in cognitive assessment, supporting longitudinal care, and using AI responsibly to assist, never replace, clinical decision-making.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs the population ages, the gap between cognitive impairment and formal diagnosis continues to widen. Primary care clinicians lack the time, staffing, and infrastructure to manage cognitive health longitudinally, even as demand accelerates.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAt the same time, blood-based biomarkers and emerging therapies are transforming the care pathway. Objective digital cognitive assessment is increasingly becoming the starting point of this new continuum—guiding risk stratification, informing laboratory and specialty referral, and enabling structured follow-up.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck provides a standardized digital infrastructure designed to support this transformation at a population scale across large health systems and accountable care organizations. By embedding repeatable cognitive measurement directly into clinical workflows, the platform helps practices and ACOs close the diagnosis gap, activate appropriate care pathways, and scale modern cognitive care across large patient populations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Physicians have limited time to address cognitive care,” said Stephen Bekanich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of BrainCheck. “Accountable Care Organizations and value-based care models are increasingly responsible for identifying cognitive impairment earlier and managing it longitudinally across large patient populations. We are seeing the emergence of collaborative care structures designed to support that accountability. BrainCheck provides the standardized, scalable infrastructure that enables these models to operate effectively.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more information, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.braincheck.com%2F&amp;esheet=54434446&amp;newsitemid=20260226481557&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.braincheck.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=0fa0a821028d5b164dfcc03c53d67fbf\" tabindex=\"0\">www.braincheck.com</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About BrainCheck</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck is a clinically validated digital platform for cognitive assessment and care, anchored by BrainCheck Assess™—its flagship FDA Class II digital cognitive assessment.

That's because of Zimbabwe's share of global lithium mine production, the commodities analyst says. At approximately 10%, Zimbabwe's share of production is high enough to make it difficult to replace in the lithium value chain, but not so high that export restrictions significantly inflate prices and trigger demand destruction downstream, as in the case of the DRC's 75% share of global cobalt mine production. \"In any case, processing facilities for lithium are already being built in Zimbabwe by Chinese companies, and lithium faces significantly lower substitution risks in the battery market compared to cobalt,\" Brooks says.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Britney Nguyen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Blockbuster earnings were anticipated as Nvidia's big customers have already indicated how much they've hiked their spending on hardware </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's stock fell after it reported a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Nvidia earns $43 billion in a quarter, does it make a sound? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Perhaps a whimper. Nvidia's stock (NVDA) is down more than 4% after Thursday's open, despite what Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore said was a historic beat-and-raise performance for a chip company. Nvidia's revenue exceeded estimates by about $3 billion, and its guidance came in roughly $5 billion above what analysts had been modeling. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That sort of beat might have been anticipated, as Nvidia's hyperscaler customers recently lifted their capital-expense forecasts, signaling a continued flood of spending on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Moore said that while the muted stock reaction is surprising, the debates hanging over Nvidia's stock \"are longer term in nature.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite the boosts to capital-expenditures forecasts, investors have been worried about the sustainability of artificial-intelligence spending, and Moore said hyperscalers' free-cash generation looks to be \"under significant pressure\" from all the investments so far. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's not so worried. Hyperscalers are asking for more compute power, he said. While the costs are a challenge, the demand is coming from a shift to inference, or running AI models, which eventually translates to revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The long term \"looks pretty good,\" Moore said in his Thursday note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Nvidia's earnings report is just a prelude to what should really matter for investors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger catalysts for Nvidia's stock may be Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming keynote at Morgan Stanley's technology conference and the chip maker's annual GTC in March, according to Moore. Investors will be looking for more details on the company's product road map, including updates on its Vera Rubin chip platform and following Feynman architecture. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said he isn't \"sure what else investors want to hear at this point,\" but buy-side expectations for Nvidia looking into 2027 seem \"very plausible\" as demand for its products shows \"zero signs of slowing.\" Specifically, he pointed to a buy-side view that $12 or more of earnings per share may be possible for Nvidia next calendar year. The FactSet consensus was for more like $10. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Nvidia has also been swept up by concerns over rising memory prices due to supply shortages. Nvidia's chips need a lot of memory, though the heavy demand for memory has helped drive industry prices higher against a tight supply backdrop. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's \"confident-but-conservative messaging on\" its 75% gross margin should be good news to investors, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said in a Wednesday note. The company likely locked in its memory supply and pricing ahead of the supply crunch, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buchalter is a bit confounded by the sluggishness of Nvidia's stock recently, as software stocks have slumped. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"To highlight just one oddity - it's odd to us that software stocks seem to be pricing existential declines while the hardware infrastructure that would enable such a future outcome is pricing a rapid decline in demand,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Nvidia is 'highly motivated' to keep investing in OpenAI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Britney Nguyen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
