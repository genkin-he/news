(Nasdaq: UCTT) today announced the pricing of its offering of $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the \"notes\") in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on March 3, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. Ultra Clean also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $75.0 million principal amount of notes.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Ultra Clean estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $511.1 million (or approximately $584.2 million if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Ultra Clean intends to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">approximately $21.9 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below;</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase 672,608 shares of its common stock; and</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">the remainder for working capital, prepayment of a portion of the company's outstanding term loan under its amended and restated credit agreement or other general corporate purposes.</li></ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Ultra Clean intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions, as described below, and the remainder for the purposes described above.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Ultra Clean. The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete. The notes will mature on March 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before December 16, 2030, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after December 16, 2030, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Ultra Clean will settle conversions in cash and, if applicable, shares of its common stock. The initial conversion rate is 11.8001 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $84.75 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 42.5% over the last reported sale price of $59.47 per share of Ultra Clean's common stock on February 26, 2026. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If a \"make-whole fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then Ultra Clean will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time for holders who convert their notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Ultra Clean's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2029 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Ultra Clean calls any or all notes for redemption, then holders of notes called for redemption may convert their notes during the related redemption conversion period, and such conversions will also constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to the notes so converted.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">If a \"fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Ultra Clean to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In connection with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\"). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Ultra Clean's common stock initially underlying the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Ultra Clean expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $104.0725 per share, which represents a premium of 75.0% over the last reported sale price of Ultra Clean's common stock of $59.47 per share on February 26, 2026, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Ultra Clean's common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Ultra Clean is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the market price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Ultra Clean has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes at that time.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Ultra Clean's common stock or other securities of Ultra Clean in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions and (y) are likely to do so following any early conversion or repurchase of the notes by Ultra Clean, if Ultra Clean elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such early conversion or repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Concurrently with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers of the notes in this offering to use approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds from the notes offering to repurchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock at a purchase price of $59.47 per share. These share repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. The offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of any common stock.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This press release includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the completion of the offering and the share repurchases, the expected amount and intended use of the net proceeds and the effects of entering into the capped call transactions described above. Forward-looking statements represent Ultra Clean's current expectations regarding future events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements.

The Commission also reversed the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)'s prior finding of infringement as to the '052 patent relating to distortion and found additional non-infringement as to the '840 patent relating to stabilization.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In addition, the ALJ's determination that Insta360's updated product designs fall outside the scope of GoPro's asserted design patent stands and is now final.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As a result of the Commission's ruling, Insta360 will continue to import and sell its existing product lineup in the United States without restriction.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"The ITC's decision reaffirms what the industry has long recognized: Insta360's technology is built on true innovation. The facts spoke for themselves,\" said JK Liu, Founder of Insta360. \"True innovators compete by building better tools. The ITC's decision allows us to continue doing what we do best: empowering users with bold, boundary-pushing technology.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"The future of this industry should be shaped by better products, not legal tactics that protect market share at the expense of consumers. Too often, successful companies are targeted by patent litigation from competitors looking to reclaim lost ground. What the industry needs is an environment where the best ideas prevail, not legal maneuvering. Only when innovation can compete freely will the entire ecosystem move forward.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The ITC's final determination is a total rebuke of Insta360's competitors' efforts to use meritless patent assertions to improperly block lawful competition. The evidentiary record developed during the investigation demonstrated that Insta360 independently developed its technology and that GoPro's allegations lacked merit. The Commission's final determination represents a complete resolution of the investigation in Insta360's favor.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Insta360</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">With a \"Think bold\" mindset, Insta360 empowers people to capture and share their lives in extraordinary ways.

It has also been courting foreign companies, seeking to bring their expertise into the domestic ecosystem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. finalized an agreement to produce 3-nanometer chips at its second Japanese facility in Kumamoto, an upgrade from previous plans for more mature nodes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That was a major leap for Japan, which doesn't yet have capacity to mass produce advanced chips essential for artificial intelligence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The government has been pushing to change that, backing projects like the Kumamoto expansion, which provides a high-volume manufacturing baseline for the country. Rapidus meanwhile is focused on the even more ambitious goal of making 2-nanometer logic chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  To further safeguard its investment in the state-backed venture, the government will hold a so-called \"golden share\" in Rapidus, granting it veto power over board decisions to protect against economic security risks and foreign influence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A combined $1.07 billion investment pledge in Rapidus from 32 companies reflects renewed interest from the private sector too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The investment pool, which includes contributions from a broad range of domestic industry leaders, surpassed the government's initial projections for private funding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The capital commitment \"exceeds the initial target of 130 billion yen,\" a sign that \"expectations for the project are clearly mounting\", Akazawa said. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 23:25 ET (04:25 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 6, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided investors with material information concerning their expected results for the Phase 3 Orbit and COSMIC studies for setrusumab in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in setrusumab's ability to ultimately reduce the annualized fracture rates of the tested patients and in the study itself to put setrusumab in an opportunity to succeed in reaching statistical significance of this key endpoint.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The defendants, the lawsuit claims, provided these positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating false and materially misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of the Phase 3 ORBIT and COSMIC programs; neither of which hit their primary endpoints of reducing annualized clinical fracture rate compared to the placebo or bisphosphonate control groups, respectively. Such statements absent these material facts caused investors to purchase Mereo's ADSs at artificially inflated prices. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Mereo class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=3988179742&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D52452&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D52452\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=52452</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=2473771113&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm</a>, on Twitter: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=2836826685&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://twitter.com/rosen_firm</a> or on Facebook: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=1496023824&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/</a>.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Attorney Advertising.

The restructuring will bring Block's (XYZ) employee count below 6,000 versus more than 10,000 today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Block soared 23.5% in after-hours action on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The layoffs at Block come just days after Citrini Research rattled markets with the publication of a blog post detailing a fictional scenario in which AI productivity tools were so powerful that they forced widespread shifts in the U.S. labor market. These particularly impacted knowledge workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" CEO Jack Dorsey said in a shareholder letter. \"We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By \"intelligence tools,\" the company is referring to AI and automation. CFO Amrita Ahuja said that Block has seen sizable productivity gains recently, not just among programmers but also within the broader company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within a year, Dorsey expects other companies to follow suit with \"similar structural changes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,\"  he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev also wondered whether the move would set a precedent for other technology companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block's \"deliberate and bold\" decision to dramatically reduce its workforce comes \"from a position of strength,\" according to Ahuja, as the company just exceeded expectations with various financial metrics and lifted its outlook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In its fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday, Block reported earnings per share of 65 cents, down from 71 cents a year before but ahead of the FactSet consensus by a penny. Gross profit, which is seen by Wall Street as a reasonably clean barometer for Block's top-line performance, was up 24% from a year before to $2.87 billion. Analysts were looking for $2.74 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block now expects 18% growth in gross profit for the full year, above the 17% target it set at an investor day late last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That new outlook reflects a \"recognition of our ability to continue to drive against our roadmap\" with a \"smaller, more nimble, flatter organizational structure,\" Ahuja said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
