When she was married, she had just a cursory participation in their married finances, but had to assume it all upon the husband's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     She said that it was easier for her to budget and not lose track of what she had spent. As long as her current cash balance was a certain level, she didn't care how much she spent above that level. I saw her transfer $150 after we were done shopping. Then she transferred $35 after her dinner bill. I'm sure after she got home by taxi she transferred the cab fare. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Have you heard of anyone who does this? It's only at most a 30-day difference so I'm not sure there is much advantage, but maybe I'm missing something besides her comfort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Credit-Card User </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm a little fazed by the scrutiny she is being subjected to for such seemingly diligent practice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Credit-Card User, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your interest in your girlfriend's credit-card habits is intriguing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm torn. On the one hand, it's good that you're taking an interest in her financial behavior and habits and want to help her. On other hand, I'm a little fazed by the scrutiny she is being subjected to for such seemingly diligent practice (but only a little). It would be a lot worse if she was spending recklessly, racking up debt on her credit cards and not paying them off every month. Paying off her cards on an almost daily basis is unusual, granted, but not of immediate cause for concern. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a possible downside to your girlfriend's regular and meticulous credit-card payments: By paying off her balance every day, she is reducing her credit-utilization ratio to virtually zero. Having a low but healthy credit-utilization ratio - say, 10%, but below 30% - shows the credit bureaus that you are using your credit card responsibly. Your girlfriend may be showing up with a 1% or 0% credit-utiltization ratio, and thereby depriving the credit bureau of seeing her regular spending habits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some people wash dishes as they cook; others pay off their credit cards after every transaction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The other snag: If you're paying off your credit card every day, you may risk losing track of how much you spend. All of your transactions will, of course, show up, but your statement balance will likely be a big fat zero. How many times would you have to go through your bank balance to get an accurate sense of how much you have spent every month, if you did not have a starting and ending balance every month or quarter? Credit cards earn points and boost your credit score, if used correctly. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some people wash dishes as they cook; others pay off their credit cards after every transaction. She's not alone. As one member of the Moneyist Facebook group writes: \"I choose to get an alert from my credit cards whenever the balance is over $X and make a payment then. I also have a calendar reminder to make a payment just before the due date. Typically, I end up making two payments a month. As a backup/failsafe, I have an automatic payment set up for the statement balance on the due date.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I'm stumped': I put $3,000 on my credit card during a vacation and my credit score plunged. Why is it so volatile? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The main credit bureaus - Equifax (EFX), Transunion (TRU) and Experian (UK:EXPN) (EXPGY)) - don't calculate their scores in exactly the same way, so people's scores are typically dinged at different times and for slightly different reasons depending on the bureau. For instance, a FICO (FICO) score has five categories: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and credit mix (10%). In other words, FICO values consumers who stay on top of their finances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For anyone with several credit cards, there are ways to cancel them in order to limit the temporary hit to your credit score.You should close cards with the shortest credit history and get rid of cards with high annual fees, unless you're planning to get rid of a card that, say, gives you extremely generous travel rewards. Also, cancel cards with points that overlap, and close cards that are costing you an annual fee. In most cases, it's wise to axe store cards, which frequently have punitive interest rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By paying off her balance every day, she is reducing her credit-utilization ratio to virtually zero. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is never a good time to rack up credit-card debt. This is not an ideal time, given the uncertainty around the labor market; the government shutdown; the Federal Reserve's caution about cutting interest rates as deeply as the White House, among others, might like; President Donald Trump's ongoing negotiations with other major economies over tariffs, and the impact increased tariffs will have on inflation; and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and Russia's war in Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ultimately, your 40-something girlfriend is displaying white-flag behavior. It's hard to wave a red flag over someone who keeps on top of their credit-card debt. Speaking of which, credit-card balances rose by $27 billion during the second quarter of 2025 and now top $1.21 trillion; that's almost a 6% increase over a year ago. Does your girlfriend have an emergency fund, a well-paid and secure job, a 401(k) or IRA, high-yield savings accounts, and a road map to retirement? Do you? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sometimes, the best financial advice starts at home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My son's credit-card company will write off $10K on a $25K debt.

However, he has early-onset dementia, which has turned our lives upside down. I am in my mid-60s, at retirement age now, but I plan to work much longer. The property can make income too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is our second marriage. Luckily, I did not mix our finances. He was self-employed and had this 10-acre home for 30 years. We almost lost everything when he got sick. He was $20,000 behind in the mortgage. We have to refinance next year and pay his business debts off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I increased my income. I got caught up on the mortgage and I am making all the household bills. I have gotten our living expenses as low as I can, and I have dental and healthcare insurance for both of us. I plan on working for many more years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The cheapest route is to keep the property and refinance next year. There is a lot of equity. Do I ask for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage when we refinance? We plan on keeping the property in the family with help from them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We do have a will and are securing everything to protect us. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Second Wife </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My boyfriend, 69, moved in. He refuses to pay more than $1,300 in rent and won't do yard work. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Wife, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You've faced up to this situation like a champ. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rather than get caught with an endless loop of questions like \"Why us?\" you just got on with it. You increased your income, and you are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. You are using the one asset he has to pay off his debts, and you're doing so with the cooperation and assistance of his family. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether or not you decide to go for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage depends a) on the interest rate and b) on your husband and his estate's ability to pay off this loan. There may come a time where you will need to sell this house to pay for care when his dementia progresses, but you can only ever do one thing, one day at a time. He is fortunate to have you at his side. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other long-term plans you can make. Your husband would do well to sign a power-of-attorney document while he is of sound mind and has the legal capacity to do so, if he has not done so already. The power of attorney should be \"durable\" and should specify that you will make decisions on his behalf when he is incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He can also assign you to hold power of attorney for healthcare decisions. This will ensure that he has someone to act on his behalf in a medical context. If he does not wish to be on life support, for example, this advanced healthcare directive would say so. A living will and/or living trust can also provide additional instructions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My husband has dementia and will need care. Will Medicaid go after my money if I use it to pay off our mortgage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Importantly, setting up a trust would help your husband's executor - that is, you - to avoid probate. Making sure you have these documents in place before he enters mid- or late-stage dementia will prevent complications later on, like having to apply to be his guardian or conservator, which can be a lengthy and complicated process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is also the time to look into Social Security benefits for your husband. \"Someone with early-onset Alzheimer's who is younger than 65 can qualify for fast-track eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits,\" according to AARP. \"After two years of receiving SSDI benefits, they can qualify for Medicare before age 65.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your husband could also purchase a private supplemental policy, Medigap, or look into a Medicare Advantage plan. \"Medicare will cover hospice care, which provides as much comfort as possible to terminally ill patients in the last days or months of life,\" AARP notes. \"A doctor must certify that they have a life expectancy of six months or less.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, what you have created for yourselves after this diagnosis is something that was taken from you at that time: certainty. You may not know exactly how much time it will take for your husband's dementia to progress to the stage where he will need full-time care, but you have put in place enough financial safeguards to protect you both when you get there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am highly alarmed by the proposed changes to retirement accounts': I don't want bitcoin or private equity in my 401(k).

Changes to the Fed's balance sheet impact the plumbing of the financial system in a way that most investors aren't likely to notice unless something breaks down. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The decision to bring the program to an end came ahead of the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding announcement next week. That matters to investors for a number of reasons. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One reason is that it could prompt market participants to shift into areas of the financial market such as stocks and short-term funding markets, helping to ease liquidity strains in the latter, according to FHN Financial macro strategist Will Compernolle in Chicago. Another reason is that it gives the U.S. Treasury a greater ability to build up the cash balance in its general account and to fund operations, he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All that ideally helps the federal government and the plumbing of the financial system run more smoothly, without throwing a wrench in markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the Fed no longer reducing its aggregate securities holdings as of Dec. 1, it stops draining liquidity from the financial system and instead reinvests proceeds from maturing securities, effectively injecting them back into the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of note, the central bank said on Wednesday that it would be reinvesting all principal payments from its holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills, as well as rolling over at auction all principal payments from its holdings of Treasurys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed buying bills </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"When the Fed's balance-sheet shrinkage is happening, securities are maturing that need to be absorbed by the private market. When the Fed stops that process, the market doesn't have to absorb securities at the same pace, and private-market investments can go to other areas such as risk assets and short-term overnight funding markets,\" Compernolle said via phone on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wrapped up in all of this is the Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement next week. \"The Treasury forms estimates for how much cash it wants in its general account, and it now has more wiggle room to build up its cash balance since it will no longer be competing with the Fed for investors' funds as of the end of the year, especially in Treasury bills,\" the strategist said. In addition, the Fed is going to become a \"willing buyer, soaking up some of the demand for T-bills.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed's balance sheet grew to a nearly $9 trillion pandemic-era peak as of mid-2022, after the central bank bought big chunks of long-duration mortgage-backed securities and Treasurys to help lower long-term interest rates, make it cheaper to borrow and stimulate demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The central bank then began shrinking its gargantuan balance sheet in June 2022 through a process known as quantitative tightening to combat high inflation and tighten financial conditions. The Fed's QT efforts were a significant factor that contributed to a decline in U.S. stock prices that year and significant losses in the bond market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While 2022 was a historically bad year for both stocks and bonds, this year is different, with the U.S. equity market repeatedly reaching fresh record highs and Treasury-market volatility falling to the lowest levels since late 2021. The end of QT in December should theoretically create an environment that supports equities, by improving overall market liquidity and lowering long-term Treasury yields. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For every dollar of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities that the Fed rolled off its balance sheet, that was a dollar of government-backed bonds that private investors would have had to purchase,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"So now that the Fed is no longer reducing its bond holdings, more of that private investment flow will go into assets that fuel the economy.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The end of QT could \"translate into more liquidity for financial markets and more private investment funds going into risky assets over a period of time,\" Adams added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yields are rising, not falling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, long-term Treasury yields keep climbing despite the Fed's quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday, after Powell pointed to \"strongly differing views\" among policymakers about what they will do in December. That may not be music to the ears of the White House, which has been vocal about wanting to see lower mortgage rates to help boost the stalled housing market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: This long-shot move could get the 30-year mortgage rate to 5% next year, says BofA Global </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equity markets ended October's final trading session on a solid note, with investors appearing to be encouraged by the latest corporate earnings results. All three major stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP closed higher for the day, the week and the month. Treasury yields finished little changed on Friday; for the week, however, 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y rose by 10.4 basis points and 8.3 basis points, respectively, to three-week highs of 4.1% and almost 4.7%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     De facto rate cut? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even if the Fed skips a December rate cut, the end of QT ahead of 2026 could give investors what is essentially the equivalent of a quarter-point rate cut anyway, according to John Luke Tyner, a portfolio manager at Alabama-based Aptus Capital Advisors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It certainly should help alleviate some of the plumbing pressures with bank reserves, as well as continue to manage the supply and, more importantly, the duration of the Treasury issuance,\" Tyner said in an email to MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not everyone agrees with such a direct comparison, however. Economist Derek Tang of Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington sees things differently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The end of QT compounds the impact of any rate cut by \"reinforcing a lot of the risk appetite in equities,\" Tang said via phone. \"Now that the end of QT is guaranteed, we have certainty.\" But he regards the Fed's decision as more of an \"incremental change\" in the Fed's balance-sheet policy, since it simply moved the plan forward by about three to six months, relative to what market participants had expected in September. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the end of QT will likely have an impact on the Treasury Department's Nov. 5 quarterly refunding announcement because it could influence how much the government thinks it can issue in short-term T-bills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tang said the Treasury \"will probably take into account what the Fed is thinking and start asking questions like, 'Can we issue more bills because the Fed is willing to absorb more of them?'\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Separately, T-bill-hungry money-market funds reached a record $7.42 trillion in assets for the week that ended on Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute. This record is a reflection of the demand that exists for Treasury bills, and supports the idea that the Treasury Department has more \"wiggle room\" to build up its cash balance by borrowing from investors, Compernolle said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
