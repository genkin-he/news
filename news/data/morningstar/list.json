As part of CTP's investment, a building with an area of 74,995 sqm has been completed so far and there are also plans to build a second warehouse with an area of 12,837 sqm.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nCTPark Sulechów is the second investment by CTP in Poland's Lubuskie Province, in addition to CTPark Iłowa which is located directly on the A18 motorway leading to the German border and where CTP has developed two buildings with a total area of 99,148 sqm so far.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Piotr Flugel, Managing Director of CTP Poland, commented: </strong><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">“Today, warehouses are much more than just space - they are a key link driving contract logistics and e-commerce.

Assay results range from 200 to 4,750 ppm and 203 ppm to 6,700 ppm, for copper and zinc, respectively, indicating strong potential for elevated base metal (Cu-Zn) concentrations across the property, specifically at the A and RJ zones. Property wide geology at N2 features volcanic and sedimentary rocks formed in regional anticlinal and synclinal flexures. Three principal deformation structures (Figure 1), oriented along the known NW-SE to WNW-ESE structural trends typical of VMS deposits in the Matagami region, function as critical geologic controls for mineralization on the property.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For the 2025 exploration season, Formation plans to concentrate its efforts on the northern part of N2, targeting gold deposit expansion and discovery along identified zones and fault systems associated with the main deformation features (specifically WNW-ESE trend), with IP surveys and drilling planned to model mineralized zones that will hopefully contribute to an updated NI-43 101 compliant resource.

Analysts had expected 287.50 billion won for the quarter, according to a FactSet-compiled consensus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Revenue fell 1.4% to 21.874 trillion won, and operating profit dropped 8.4% to 688.90 billion won, in line with the company's preliminary estimates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Growth at the company's home-appliance and auto-parts segments stayed resilient despite challenges from higher tariffs and soft demand in major global markets, with revenue rising 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The sluggishness in its media and entertainment segment, which includes televisions, continued, with revenue slumping 9.5%. Costs associated with marketing and early retirement programs for employees in the segment weighed on operating profit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Shares of LG Electronics were flat after the results. The stock has underperformed the broader market this year, gaining by around 5% compared with the benchmark Kospi's roughly 70% gain. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 01:47 ET (05:47 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

Commerce is going to be rocky for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve to Reduce Bank Supervision Staff by 30% </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve officials are planning to reduce the staff of its banking supervision arm by 30% by the end of next year, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The reductions would leave the Fed's supervision and regulation division with about 350 people, down from a previously authorized head count of 500, according to the memo. The cuts were announced by the Fed's new top regulatory official, Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, during a morning meeting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The ECB and Fed Are Going in Different Directions. Can It Last? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as investors question whether the institution's most aggressive easing campaign since the financial crisis is really done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The ECB held its key interest rate at 2%, where it has been since June. The central bank cut rates by 2 percentage points in a year before hitting pause over the summer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney Channels Go Dark on YouTube TV </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney channels including ESPN, ABC and FX vanished from Google's YouTube TV platform after the two sides failed to come to terms on a new distribution agreement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The channels went dark in roughly 10 million homes shortly before midnight Eastern time. Disney and YouTube TV had held contentious negotiations leading up to the channels being removed. The deadline to reach a deal was 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech Is Spending More Than Ever on AI and It's Still Not Enough </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Silicon Valley's biggest companies are already planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year. They all say it's nowhere near enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta Platforms says it is still running up against capacity constraints as it tries to train new AI models and power its existing products at the same time. Microsoft says it is seeing so much customer demand for its data-center-driven services that it plans to double its data-center footprint in the next two years.
