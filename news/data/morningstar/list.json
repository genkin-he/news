Our uranium revenue is ramping up, and we signed two new long-term contracts with major utilities that are expected to increase our portfolio pricing in the coming years. In addition, we are investing significantly in our industry-leading U.S. assets, as we expect to remain the country's uranium leader for many years to come.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Equally impressive has been our progress in rare earth processing and production. Energy Fuels' rare earth products have been confirmed, qualified, and used by manufacturers for EVs and hybrid EVs. In 2025, we made considerable investments in our rare earth segment. We strongly believe now is the time to capture opportunities, as vertical integration and access to low-cost 'molecules' are the key to higher margins, increased market share, and overall competitiveness in the space. In years past, we invested 'upstream' by securing low-cost rare earth feedstock at our Donald joint venture in Australia, Vara Mada project in Madagascar, and Bahia project in Brazil. Now, we are investing 'downstream', including our recently announced proposed acquisition of Australian Strategic Materials (\"<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">ASM</strong>\"), which upon completion, will expand our reach into highly coveted rare earth metals and alloys. The proposed acquisition of ASM will also bring another potential material source of feedstock from the Dubbo project located in NSW, Australia.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Ross Bhappu, President of Energy Fuels, added \"We recently released feasibility studies for several of our development projects, including the proposed Phase 2 Circuit expansion of our rare earth processing at the White Mesa Mill in Utah and our Vara Mada project in Madagascar, demonstrating impressive net present values and future cashflows. The combined NPV of the Phase 2 Circuit and the Vara Mada project is $3.7 billion, or $15.26 per share (based on current shares outstanding), with expected EBITDA of $765 million for the first 15 years when the Phase 2 Circuit is combined with the expected EBITDA from the Vara Mada project over those years. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"With an estimated capital cost of $410 million for the Phase 2 Circuit and an estimated all-in production cost of $29.39/kg NdPr equivalent produced from our Vara Mada project, <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">we believe our REE oxide production ranks among the lowest capital and operating costs globally.</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mr. Bhappu continued, \"We believe interest in Energy Fuels is accelerating as customers, governments, and investors favor companies like us that deliver on promises.

The increase was primarily due to higher ongoing costs as expected following the acquisition of Base Resources Limited in Q4 2024, including approximately $15.0 million increased ongoing selling, general and administrative costs associated with an expanded workforce to effectively progress the Company's global operations. Exploration and development costs were approximately $9.0 million higher to progress our projects, including: further exploration and development activities relating to the Juniper Zone at the Pinyon Plain Project, development at the La Sal Project, exploration at the Bahia Project and delineation drilling at Nichols Ranch.

These enhancements are expected to be made, and the Phase 1 Circuit operational to accept MREC and similar intermediary REE products in 2027.

By design, ivonescimab displays unique cooperative binding to each of its intended targets with multifold higher affinity to PD-1 when in the presence of VEGF.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThis is intended to differentiate ivonescimab as there is potentially higher expression (presence) of both PD-1 and VEGF in tumor tissue and the tumor microenvironment (TME) as compared to normal tissue in the body. We believe ivonescimab’s specifically engineered tetravalent structure (four binding sites) enables higher avidity (accumulated strength of multiple binding interactions) in the TME (Zhong, et al, <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">iScience</em>, 2025). This tetravalent structure, the intentional novel design of the molecule, and bringing these two targets into a single bispecific antibody with cooperative binding qualities have the potential to direct ivonescimab to the tumor tissue versus healthy tissue. The intent of this design, together with a half-life of 6 to 7 days after the first dose (Zhong, et al, <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">iScience</em>, 2025) increasing to approximately 10 days at steady state dosing, is to improve upon previously established efficacy thresholds, side effects, and safety profiles associated with prior approved drugs to these targets.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIvonescimab was engineered by Akeso Inc. (HKEX Code: 9926.HK) and is currently utilized in multiple Phase III clinical trials. Over 4,000 patients have been treated with ivonescimab in clinical studies globally, and over 60,000 patients when considering those treated in a commercial setting in China, as noted by Akeso.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThere are currently 15 Phase III clinical studies that are either announced, ongoing, or have been completed studying ivonescimab, four of which are Summit-sponsored global studies, one of which is a multiregional study sponsored by a cooperative group, and ten of which are being or have been conducted in China by Akeso. Summit began its clinical development of ivonescimab in NSCLC, commencing enrollment in 2023 in two multiregional Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi and HARMONi-3. In 2025, the Company began enrolling patients in HARMONi-7. Summit expanded its Phase III clinical development program into CRC in the fourth quarter of 2025 by initiating enrollment in HARMONi-GI3.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi is a Phase III clinical trial which intends to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who were previously treated with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI (e.g., osimertinib). Detailed results of the study were provided in September 2025, and a Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing authorization, which the FDA accepted for filing in January 2026; the goal Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is November 14, 2026.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi-3 is a Phase III clinical trial, which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic, squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi-7 is a Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi-GI3 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with first-line unresectable metastatic CRC.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAlso including Summit’s license territories, a Phase III study is planned to be conducted by GORTEC, a cooperative group dedicated to Head and Neck Oncology, in recurrent / metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (r/m HNSCC). ILLUMINE is a three-arm Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy, as well as ivonescimab in combination with ligufalimab, Akeso’s proprietary anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, compared to monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive r/m HNSCC.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIn addition, Akeso has recently had positive read-outs in three single-region (China), randomized Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi-A, HARMONi-2, and HARMONi-6, for ivonescimab in NSCLC, including a statistically significant overall survival benefit in HARMONi-A with a manageable safety profile in each study.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi-A was a Phase III clinical trial which evaluated ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with an EGFR TKI.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi-2 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating monotherapy ivonescimab against monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have positive PD-L1 expression.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHARMONi-6 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating ivonescimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAkeso is actively conducting multiple Phase III clinical studies in settings outside of NSCLC, including biliary-tract cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIvonescimab is an investigational therapy that is not approved by any regulatory authority in Summit’s license territories, including the United States and Europe. Ivonescimab was initially approved for marketing authorization in China in May 2024. Ivonescimab was granted Fast Track designation by the US FDA for the HARMONi clinical trial setting.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Summit Therapeutics</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSummit Therapeutics Inc. is a biopharmaceutical oncology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of patient-, physician-, caregiver- and societal-friendly medicinal therapies intended to improve quality of life, increase potential duration of life, and resolve serious unmet medical needs.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSummit was founded in 2003 and our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (symbol \"SMMT\").

Management now seems to be acknowledging that it needs to make changes in a rapidly evolving landscape. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company announced some of those Thursday afternoon, alongside fiscal-fourth quarter earnings results. Duolingo's management disclosed that the transition could weigh on financials in the near term but expressed confidence in a long-term payoff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some investors may not be waiting to see how things play out, however, with Duolingo shares off more than 20% in Thursday's extended session. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Duolingo has been trying to integrate AI into its own product offerings, including by letting customers video-chat with an AI-powered animated character and engage in more voice-based AI experiences to test their progress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company announced it will move its core AI product, \"Video Call with Lily,\" to be part of the company's \"Super Duolingo tier\" subscription, down from its more exclusive \"Duolingo Max\" tier. It also announced new AI-powered lesson plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Further, Duolingo will try to respond to a growth slowdown in daily active users by increasing the value proposition of its free tier. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Software stocks bounce as Nvidia shares falter. Is a new rotation trade in store? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Up until now, the main way we've increased bookings per user is by adding small amounts of friction to encourage more people to subscribe, for example by increasing ad load or subscription upsells,\" Duolingo said in a shareholder letter. \"Unfortunately, we believe that this extra friction is part of the reason our DAU growth has slowed, so we've decided to prioritize user growth over monetization.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The moves are expected to come with several financial tradeoffs. For one, the company said in the letter that it expects revenue growth will \"step down sequentially\" in the second and third quarters, before \"stabilizing\" in the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bookings, meanwhile, are expected to grow just 11% this fiscal year, versus an almost 20% growth rate the company said it expected it would see \"if we operated like we have in past years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Profits will also come under pressure as the new moves require heavy investment. Duolingo expects a 25% margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the current fiscal year, versus the 29.5% margin it posted for its just-completed fiscal year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEO Luis von Ahn said in a video message that \"this may seem a little strange if you just look at the next quarter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But here we're trying to build a company for a very long time,\" he added, and that in the long term, the company's goal is to educate \"billions\" of people. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Salesforce's record $50 billion stock-buyback plan is proving controversial on Wall Street </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Hannah Pedone </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Further, it said it would establish direct points of contact with Canadian law-enforcement officials, help direct users in distress to relevant local support agencies, and toughen its detection system to prevent attempts to evade safeguards. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"These immediate commitments are only the first step in the work we must do in partnership with the Canadian government to improve AI safety,\" said Ann O'Leary, vice-president of global policy at OpenAI. \"With the benefit of our continued learnings, under our enhanced law enforcement referral protocol, we would refer the account banned in June 2025 to law enforcement if it were discovered today.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The pledges come after OpenAI executives met with senior Canadian officials this week. Police have identified Jesse Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a fatal shooting at a school in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia this month that killed eight people and left dozens injured. Police said Van Rootselaar was found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury at the school scene. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last week that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT.

Those results arrived just two days after Sweetgreen launched new wrap sandwiches, priced a bit lower than some of its bowls and salads, after more expensive fare kept some customers away last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Sweetgreen (SG) were down 4.9% after hours on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The drop in Sweetgreen's stock price came after shares of rival Cava (CAVA) rocketed higher on Wednesday, following a forecast for a same-store sales gain this year. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain's CEO said customers could be getting tired of chasing discounts. However, other chains, like McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG), have been more tempered in their expectations for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Cava were down 0.6% after hours Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen's management on Thursday said it would move ahead with more urgency to strengthen service standards, introduce new menu items and speed up checkout times. It also plans to improve marketing around things like high-quality ingredients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEO Jonathan Neman said that the company was currently testing new wrap sandwiches, which it introduced on Tuesday in parts of New York, the Midwest and California. If those items do well, he said Sweetgreen plans to expand the offerings beyond that trial run in the middle of the year. The prices for those wraps start at $10.95. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen said fourth-quarter sales fell 3.5% to $155.2 million, with a per-share loss of 42 cents. Both figures were worse than analysts expected. Same-stores sales were down 11.5%, which weren't as bad as anticipated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The chain said it expects same-store sales to fall 2% to 4% this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the past year, fast-casual restaurants - which try to offer the quality of a sit-down chain at the speed of fast food - have been squeezed by value offerings from rivals like Chili's and McDonald's. Against that backdrop, Sweetgreen's stock is down 73.5% over the past 12 months. Over recent months, consumers have showed signs of waning interest in often-pricey salad and bowl offerings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ahead of the results, UBS analysts said Sweetgreen faced concerns over spending among younger consumers, who make up about a third of the people who visit the chain. They also noted that the chain has struggled in cities like Los Angeles and areas in the Northeast. During an earnings call in November, Sweetgreen said New York was its \"most challenged market.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many restaurants, after raising prices to cover for the past several years of supply shocks, are now trying to find ways to cut them after scaring customers away. But the discount war has weighed on margins and, in some cases, stock prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The company's fourth-quarter revenue reached $1.57 billion, growing 110% year over year and exceeding the $1.55 billion FactSet consensus. But the company posted a net loss of $452 million, far steeper than the $342 million anticipated by analysts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"2025 was a defining year for CoreWeave as we became the fastest cloud in history to reach $5 billion in annual revenue,\" chair and CEO Michael Intrator said in a statement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Demand for CoreWeave's products is strong. The company's backlog grew to $66.8 billion in the fourth quarter - quadrupling from the beginning of 2025 - and CoreWeave is building aggressively to turn the backlog into revenue. The company added 260 megawatts of active power capacity in the fourth quarter alone, bringing its total to over 850 megawatts. More important for future scaling, CoreWeave has contracted for 3.1 gigawatts of total power, securing access to address a critical artificial-intelligence bottleneck. The company has resolved the data-center delays that impeded revenue growth in the the third quarter, Intrator said on the earnings call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the cost of building the massive data centers required to house Nvidia's (NVDA) high-end chips continues to weigh on the bottom line, especially as CoreWeave takes on debt to fund its expansion. While CoreWeave is growing revenues at a rapid clip, the company's interest expenses are increasing at a similar pace. Net interest expenses for the fourth quarter were $388 million, a 160% year-over-year increase. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adjusted operating income was $88 million for the fourth quarter, \"lower than expected as a result of deploying infrastructure ahead of our expectations,\" CFO Nitin Agrawal said on the call. The adjusted operating margin was 6%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One part of CoreWeave's solution to growing interest expenses appears to be expansion into higher-margin revenue streams. On the call, Intrator emphasized new avenues of monetization for CoreWeave such as CPU, storage, software and development tools. \"The opportunity to add additional value to these customers as their AI workloads mature is substantial and represents meaningful upside over time,\" Intrator said, adding that the revenue would be \"higher margin\" and is not currently factored into guidance estimates at this time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Capital expenditures in 2026 are anticipated to be $30 billion to $35 billion, more than twice the levels in 2025 and higher than analysts' expectations of $26.9 billion. Management emphasized that the capex spending is tied to already signed customer contracts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CoreWeave guided for current-quarter revenues between $1.9 billion and $2 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $2.3 billion. CoreWeave anticipates exiting 2026 with $17 billion to $19 billion of annual recurring revenue, and reaching $30 billion of ARR by 2027. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts on the call were curious about how capex levels could drive revenue growth and improve margins going forward. While CoreWeave will incur upfront costs to bring capacity online, Agrawal signaled that the first quarter of 2026 will represent the \"trough\" for margins. He also highlighted high-margin \"accretive\" services like AI storage - which now boasts an 80% attach rate among large customers - as a force that could eventually drive long-term margins to the 25% to 30% range. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: CoreWeave's stock drops.

WBD informed Netflix that it had four days to counter with a new proposal or abandon the deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If the board determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, that, after considering any revisions to the terms of the Netflix merger agreement proposed by Netflix, the [Paramount] proposal continues to constitute a 'company superior proposal,' WBD would be entitled to terminate the Netflix merger agreement,\" Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The reversal represented a stunning change in fortune for Paramount, which had launched a hostile offer following WBD's acceptance of the Netflix bid in early December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After repeated attempts to get the WBD board to reconsider, Paramount finally managed to punch through on Monday when it raised its offer by $1 per share, from its previous bid of $30 a share. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Paramount also offered to pay a 25-cents-a-share \"ticking fee\" for every quarter the deal doesn't close after Sept. 30 of this year, as well as a $7 billion termination fee if the merger does not clear regulatory hurdles and a $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would be required to pay Netflix. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We are pleased WBD's board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing,\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The significantly sweetened bid from Paramount put the onus on Netflix to either raise its bid of $27.75 per share for Warner's studio and streaming businesses or drop out of the bidding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Paramount had previously offered $108 billion to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its declining television business, which includes cable channels like CNN, Discovery and Cartoon Network. Netflix's bid of $82.7 billion was just for its streaming and studio divisions, leaving Warner Bros.' television unit to be spun off into a separate company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A key part of Paramount's pitch was that its offer is more likely to pass muster with regulators. Ellison and his father, Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, enjoy a good relationship with President Donald Trump. Netflix had argued that Paramount is on no better footing with regulators, and that claiming otherwise was an attempt to mislead shareholders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration has signaled that it intends to scrutinize the deal. Trump at one point said he had no plan to involve himself in the transaction - then, over the weekend, demanded that Netflix fire board member Susan Rice, a former Obama administration official, or else \"pay the consequences.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Regulators in Europe will also have to sign off on any deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many in Hollywood also raised concerns regarding a sale to Netflix, pointing to the company's history of moving away from industry-accepted norms regarding theatrical releases and exclusivity agreements. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sarandos said Netflix intended to run Warner Bros. independently from the rest of the company and maintain its studio's existing practices in regards to theatrical releases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Additionally, Netflix had argued that the amount of debt Paramount would need to finance the deal would result in broad layoffs in order to make it financially sustainable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Lukas I.
