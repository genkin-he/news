This milestone positions Canoly as one of the fastest-growing players in the US$200 juicer segment, a category that has seen renewed interest as consumers prioritize at-ho<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">me wellness. </span></p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922064/canoly_c16_cold_press_juicer_in_kitchen_setting_celebrating_100000_sales_milestone.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922064/canoly_c16_cold_press_juicer_in_kitchen_setting_celebrating_100000_sales_milestone.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The market segment of 3-in-1 cold press juicers around the price range of USD 200 had long been overlooked. In 2025, Canoly identified the gap and seized the opportunity with the launch of the <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://canoly.com/products/c16-cold-press-juicer\" tabindex=\"0\">C16 cold press juicer</a>, which combines the functionalities of cold press juicing, making plant-based milk, and preparing sorbet, and it quickly became the brand's best-selling model.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"In an era of rising health consciousness, the rapid expansion of the global juicer market reflects people's pursuit of a higher quality of life. Since its inception, Canoly has been committed to leveraging technology to lower the barriers to healthy living, making it easy for every household to enjoy fresh, nutritious food,\" said James Collins, CEO of Canoly. \"This sales milestone affirms our belief that the juicing category, which is long overlooked because it was seen as complicated and hard to maintain, can be transformed with the right technology. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in innovations that reduce barriers for households and bring fresh, nutritious food into everyday routines.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Cold pressing uses slow, controlled pressure rather than high-speed blades to crush and press ingredients. This low-speed process reduces heat and oxidation, preserving nutrients, enzymes, and flavor. The result is juice with higher nutrient stability and better absorption.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The C16 features hands-free juicing, ideal for frequent use or large batches. It comes with a powerful 250W brushless AC motor and a large 90-oz hopper with a built-in pre-cutting blade, allowing users to simply place whole fruits, such as an entire apple, into the hopper and effortlessly produce a cup of richly nutritious juice. It delivers up to 96% juice yield with the help of a 0.1 mm fine filter, and all parts are made from BPA‑free plastic. Cleanup is also quick and easy, taking just about one minute. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In addition, Canoly's expanded product portfolio also includes the C09 3-in-1 model, which meets varied capacity needs.  It is engineered for unparalleled performance and convenience. Meanwhile, the C03 is a more compact edition, ideal for small kitchens or light-duty uses. The slow-turning auger gently presses to minimize heat and protect nutrients, while the fine mesh strainer ensures a pure, smooth texture in every glass.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Founded in 2019, Canoly is a kitchen appliance brand dedicated to making healthy living accessible through innovative, multifunctional products. Its cold press juicers are now sold in 12 countries, with a 4.2/5 rating on Trustpilot. Canoly cold press juicers have been widely praised for their performance, quiet operation, and value for money, steadily building the brand's reputation within the healthy living community.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Looking forward, Canoly will further strengthen its presence in the cold press juicer category through continuous innovation while expanding its portfolio of multifunctional kitchen solutions, bringing everyday wellness within reach for more households around the world. <span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To celebrate the brand's continued growth, Canoly will launch an International Women's Day promotion with an exclusive discount of USD 38.</span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"http://canoly.com\" tabindex=\"0\"><span>Canoly's official website &gt; canoly.com</span></a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Media Contact:<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Canoly Official<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Email: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:support@canoly.com\" tabindex=\"0\">support@canoly.com</a> <br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Phone: +1 (347) 470-6888<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>WhatsApp: +1 (213) 773-5416</span></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN97631&amp;sd=2026-02-27\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canolys-c16-cold-press-juicer-hits-100-000-sales-milestone-within-six-months-of-launch-302699654.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canolys-c16-cold-press-juicer-hits-100-000-sales-milestone-within-six-months-of-launch-302699654.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Canoly</p></span>\n</div>",

Specifically, the press release revealed the number of portfolio companies on non-accrual status had more than doubled, and as a result, debt investments on non-accrual status at cost increased by 289% (from 3.7% to 14.4% of the portfolio).

Total losses, both realized and unrealized, were revealed to have ballooned to $194,895,042 for the fiscal year, a 186% increase year over year, in large part due to a newly added $72.3 million net unrealized loss within the fourth quarter.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stock sinks toward lowest price in nearly four years after profit and sales missed expectations, and average user growth slowed </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of FanDuel's parent were pointing down after disappointing earnings. Its users lost too many bets and left for competitors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment were pointing down toward the lowest prices seen in years in early Friday trading, a day after the online sports-betting and iGaming platform's fourth-quarter results disappointed investors in more ways than one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The big problem with the latest quarter seemed to be that FanDuel won too many bets, leaving its users tapped out and unable to bet more. And because the company mistimed offers for free bets, those users went to competitors offering betting deals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For a management team historically viewed as operationally disciplined, allowing margin optimization to run to the point of impairing customer activity represents a notable lapse in execution,\" Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey wrote in a note to clients. \"This is not simply a sports results issue; it reflects a breakdown in customer lifecycle management during a period of elevated competitive intensity.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the previous quarter, the company reported disappointing sportsbook results due to \"customer-friendly\" sports results for the first two months of the quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The stock (FLUT) dropped 12.8% in premarket trading, putting it on track to open around the lowest prices seen since October 2022. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Separately, CEO Peter Jackson tried to assuage concerns that the prediction-market platform the company launched in December would cannibalize its sports-betting offering, writing in a shareholder letter that, after a comprehensive review, \"we have not identified any evidence of any meaningful impact.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the latest quarter, the company said that revenue rose 24.9% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, but that missed the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of $4.93 billion. In the U.S., sportsbook revenue jumped 35.4% to $1.5 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Average monthly players in the U.S. increased 5.3% to 4.8 million, while growth in wagers was slower, up 3% to $16.86 billion. The growth in average players was down from 8% in the previous quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Our standard generosity playbook proved less effective in [the fourth quarter] as our investment phasing did not sufficiently align with the pattern of sports results during this period,\" Jackson said, according to an AlphaSense transcript of the postearnings call with analysts. \"As a result, we saw a higher churn within our customer base as a result of loss of market share.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's his way of saying the company should've provided more betting deals after their users had lost their money, so they didn't have to leave for other betting platforms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, fell to $1.74 from $2.94 a year ago, and fell short of the FactSet EPS consensus of $1.85. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Flutter's stock has fallen 54.7% over the past 12 months through Thursday, while shares of rival DraftKings (DKNG) have shed 45% and the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has advanced 17.9%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
