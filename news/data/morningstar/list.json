The money is not currently in a bank account and it is not part of an estate - let's assume it's just cash in an envelope - and I live in a state with no inheritance tax. I assume I can make this deposit legally and that there are no tax consequences. Am I correct? If so, must I provide a recent death certificate? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lone Ranger </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 2025 has been one hell of a year. Consumers should expect more 'silent pain' in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how it was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope rather than an electronic transfer - and I'm not sure I need or want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect any alleged money laundering; it does not mean that you have done anything wrong, as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong. In other words, there should be a paper trail if/when you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? That's \"structuring\" and it's illegal. This occurs if you deliberately break up financial transactions to avoid triggering mandatory reports required by law. Authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a fine-tooth comb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor and/or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of the death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax vs. estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As you note, only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source, and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent might the bank request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.

The two-year Treasury yield fell 0.8 basis points to 3.462%, while the 10-year yield declined 0.6 basis points to 4.041%, according to Tradeweb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Yields on U.K. government bonds were steady as investors await the outcome of Thursday's special election. Ten-year gilt yields were little changed at 4.319%, Tradeweb data show. Eurozone government bond investors will focus on Italy's auction of up to 9 billion euros in 2031- and 2036-dated fixed-rate government bonds, or BTPs, and 2035-dated floating rate notes, or CCTeu, with results due shortly after 1000 GMT. Italy's auction will round off government bond sales in the eurozone for February. The 10-year German Bund yield was up 0.3 basis points at 2.711%. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Bitcoin fell as U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open after Nvidia's earnings. The drop in cryptocurrencies since October has come alongside a similar fall in tech stocks, Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar said in a note. \"We believe that the linkage between crypto and tech stocks will persist over the coming months.\" Bitcoin dropped 1.5% to $67,904 after reaching a one-week high of $69,847 Wednesday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Oil prices edged higher ahead of a third round of nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran later on Thursday.

Lorenze will walk away with slightly less, however, having bought her abode for $2.4 million in summer 2024, while Paul purchased his in 2023 for $2.5 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Paul has not commented on his decision to sell his Sunshine State home, his fiancee revealed in a recent YouTube video that she was preparing to part ways with her Fairfield, Conn., dwelling-telling her followers that she had \"stumbled upon\" the perfect property for the happy couple. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I was actually not looking to move,\" she revealed in December. \"[But I] stumbled upon this listing and it had everything that I could ever imagine.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Describing it as her \"dream forever home,\" Lorenze went on to reveal that she and Paul went to see the property in person soon after Thanksgiving, joking that they were convinced the property couldn't ever be as \"perfect\" in real life as it appeared in listing photos. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Much to their surprise however, it was even better than they'd imagined. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I was like, 'Oh s-t,'\" Lorenze recalled of her reaction to seeing it for the first time. \"I thought about it, and I thought about what my life is going to look like in the next three years, and how I'm getting married, how I want to have kids in the future. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"More privacy is really important to me, more land is important to me, and this property has so many of the things that Tommy and I love.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Among the many amenities that stuck out to the couple were the property's \"big barn,\" as well as an on-site tennis court and a large yard, which Lorenze notes would allow her partner to train at home, while also enabling her to have her horses at home, rather than in a stable nearby. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The house is older, but restored, it has a beautiful guesthouse ... it's just beyond,\" she went on. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tommy Paul and Paige Lorenze at London Fashion Week in September 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lorenze's former dwelling, which she purchased via an LLC named for the address, sits on a pretty 2.14-acre parcel and offers four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the dwelling is in close proximity to the road-something that doesn't necessarily afford the online star much privacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In its listing, the home is described as an \"exceptional\" abode that offers a \"perfect blend of weekend retreat and everyday living,\" thanks to its plum location just 60 miles outside of Manhattan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The 5,000-square-foot home, which was built in 2000, features several impressive upgrades, including \"newly added wooden beams and fireplace\" in the living room, as well as top-of-the-line appliances in the enormous gourmet kitchen. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: I'm

the main floor, including a bright blue living room, a cozy breakfast nook, a formal dining room, and a den with large French doors to the garden and the glittering pool. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many of the spaces will be familiar to followers of Lorenze, who regularly features the property in the background of her social media posts, including her expansive walk-in closet and dressing room, where she regularly tapes chatty update videos for her fans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Paul's home boasts a much more modern aesthetic, having been completed in 2023-the same year he bought it-as well an array of its own very impressive amenities, including impact glass to ward against inclement weather, designer LED lighting, and a detached casita. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Oversized sliders spanning nearly 30 feet, frame views of the resort-style pool and spa, fill the home with natural light and seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor living,\" notes the listing, which is held by Alex Rybakov and Jonathan Phillips, of JM Phillips Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Home Prices Expected To Fall in Many Cities in 2026, Top Homebuilder Economist Says </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Paul's property is much smaller than his fiancee's, however, offering just over 3,000 square feet of living space on a 0.23-acre plot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The five-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom property also features a gourmet kitchen as well as an additional guesthouse that is described as being the ideal spot for a home office or \"state-of-the-art fitness studio.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This is a rare opportunity to own a meticulously crafted, high-end contemporary home in one of East Boca's most desirable settings, where design, comfort, and lifestyle come together seamlessly,\" the listing concludes. </p>\n<p

data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lorenze-who runs a local farm stand in Weston, Conn., via her lifestyle brand, Dairy Boy-noted that she and Paul would not be moving into the property until February, allowing them time to try to find buyers for their respective abodes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The happy couple, who began dating in 2022, announced their engagement in July 2025, with Lorenze revealing that Paul had popped the question on the beach during a getaway in Nantucket, weeks before he took part in that year's U.S. Open. </p>\n<p

surprise proposal, admitting: \"I did not think it was going to happen on Nantucket, or when it did. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"My friends and family were

Their favorable solvency properties, global regulatory acceptance, and compatibility with continuous manufacturing systems reinforce market leadership. Alcohols are especially critical in biologics manufacturing, where strict residual solvent limits apply.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Application: API Synthesis Anchors Demand (~35% Share)</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) synthesis represents the largest application segment. Solvents serve as reaction media, extraction agents, crystallization aids, and purification carriers, making them indispensable in multi-step synthesis workflows.
