Seoul will invest $350 billion in the U.S.--including $200 billion of cash installments, capped at $20 billion annually to minimize financial-market risks. In return, the Trump administration will lower tariffs on a swath of items, including vehicles, to 15% from 25%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The lower U.S. duty is welcome news for Hyundai, which has been subject to a 25% levy since April due to the protracted negotiations.

(LSE:GENF)(OTCQB:GENFF), a biotechnology company headquartered in the UK with R&amp;D facilities in Belgium, is pioneering gene therapies to decelerate the aging process, with the goal of promoting longer and healthier lives while mitigating the financial, emotional, and social impacts of a fast-growing aging global population. Genflow's lead compound, GF-1002, works through the delivery of a centenarian variant of the SIRT6 gene which has yielded promising results. Genflow's 12-month proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating their SIRT6-centenarian gene therapy in aged dogs began in March 2025. Other programs planned include a clinical trial that will explore the potential benefits of GF-1002 in treating MASH (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis), the most prevalent chronic liver disease for which there are no effective treatments.
