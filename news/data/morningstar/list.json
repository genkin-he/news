The dollar and U.S. Treasurys were flat. Gold and oil futures were lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equities: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European equity futures were lower after post-earnings slumps in Meta Platforms and Microsoft shares weighed on major stock indexes on Wall Street. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors gave a thumbs down to Meta's plans to spend even more to stay in the artificial-intelligence race, marking the stock's biggest one-day decline in more than three years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yields on Meta's bonds jumped after the company said it was looking to raise at least $25 billion from a jumbo debt sale. Increased spending plans also cast a shadow over an otherwise-stellar Microsoft earnings report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"None of these companies can keep up this huge spending on AI forever,\" said David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs, an investment-research firm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Forex: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The European Central Bank is seen by some analysts as needing to do more to support growth and offset the impact of a strong euro. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The currency's rise has revived concerns about too-low inflation in the eurozone, because it makes imports cheaper. If the Fed keeps cutting rates, as widely expected by investors, it could amplify the pressure, by boosting the relative appeal of the euro. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Even if the ECB still tries to make us believe that it's done cutting rates, I am convinced that the Fed's rate cuts, a strengthening euro, and the delayed impact from U.S. tariffs could still force the ECB to cut rates in December or early next year,\" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING in Frankfurt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bonds: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. Treasury yields held steady as traders pared bets on an interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said one was far from a done deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Powell's statement \"caught the market a little off-guard as it reduced visibility into future rate cuts and highlighted a growing divide among policymakers,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, wrote to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Energy: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil fell in the early trading session. \"The market is now watching this weekend's OPEC+ meeting and discussions of its output policy,\" said ANZ Research analysts in a research report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies significantly lift risks to supply,\" the analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This could prompt OPEC+ to approve another increase of 137,000 barrels per day in supply for December, the analysts added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Metals: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gold edged lower, paring some of the overnight gains seen amid prospects of continued central-bank demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Central-bank purchases of the precious metal climbed 28% on quarter to an estimated net 220 tons in 3Q, the World Gold Council said in a report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Central banks are likely to continue their buying spree,\" it said, adding that \"demand has broadened, with hitherto dormant banks becoming active.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     - </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iron ore fell as prices face near-term downward pressure as supply has been strong, with port inventories accumulating quickly, said Nanhua Futures analysts in a research note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, demand has been weighed amid a lack of policy support. Downward pressure may persist unless steel mills achieve large-scale production cuts, they noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China Factory Activity Gauge Signals Deepening Manufacturing Gloom </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China's economic momentum continued to weaken, with a manufacturing gauge signaling mounting headwinds for the world's second-largest economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The official manufacturing purchasing managers index saw a sharp drop to 49.0 in October, from 49.8 in September, putting it below the 50 threshold that separates an expansion in activity from a contraction for seven straight months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S.-China Truce Brings Little Peace for Businesses Caught in Superpower Standoff </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After a face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Trump said the meeting wasn't just nice, it was a 12 on a scale of one to 10. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But for businesses caught between the two superpowers, the ugly reality remains: The U.S. and China haven't addressed their underlying conflicts. Commerce is going to be rocky for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve to Reduce Bank Supervision Staff by 30% </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve officials are planning to reduce the staff of its banking supervision arm by 30% by the end of next year, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The reductions would leave the Fed's supervision and regulation division with about 350 people, down from a previously authorized head count of 500, according to the memo. The cuts were announced by the Fed's new top regulatory official, Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, during a morning meeting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The ECB and Fed Are Going in Different Directions. Can It Last? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as investors question whether the institution's most aggressive easing campaign since the financial crisis is really done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The ECB held its key interest rate at 2%, where it has been since June. The central bank cut rates by 2 percentage points in a year before hitting pause over the summer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney Channels Go Dark on YouTube TV </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney channels including ESPN, ABC and FX vanished from Google's YouTube TV platform after the two sides failed to come to terms on a new distribution agreement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The channels went dark in roughly 10 million homes shortly before midnight Eastern time. Disney and YouTube TV had held contentious negotiations leading up to the channels being removed. The deadline to reach a deal was 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech Is Spending More Than Ever on AI and It's Still Not Enough </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Silicon Valley's biggest companies are already planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year. They all say it's nowhere near enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta Platforms says it is still running up against capacity constraints as it tries to train new AI models and power its existing products at the same time. Microsoft says it is seeing so much customer demand for its data-center-driven services that it plans to double its data-center footprint in the next two years. And Amazon.com says it is racing to bring more cloud capacity online as soon as it can. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Write to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Expected Major Events for Friday </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     05:30/NED: Oct Flash Estimate CPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     06:00/FIN: Sep Retail sales </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:00/TUR: Sep Foreign Trade </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:00/GER: Sep Retail Trade </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:00/GER: Sep Foreign trade price indices </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:00/UK: Oct Nationwide House Price Index </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:30/HUN: Sep PPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:30/SWI: Sep Retail Sales </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:45/FRA: Sep PPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     07:45/FRA: Oct Provisional CPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     10:00/ITA: Oct Provisional CPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     10:00/ITA: Oct Cities CPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     10:00/LUX: Sep PPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     10:00/EU: Oct Flash Estimate euro area inflation </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     10:00/GRE: Aug Turnover Index in Retail Trade </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     10:00/CYP: Sep PPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     11:00/POR: Sep Industrial production index </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     15:59/UKR: Sep POSTPONED: Industrial Production </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     16:59/SPN: Sep Budget deficit </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     16:59/BEL: Sep PPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     16:59/SPN: Aug Monthly Balance of Payments </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All times in GMT.

This travel-themed reality show continues iQIYI's legacy of delivering standout seasonal IPs while highlighting authentic and compelling female narratives.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2810051/The_Blooming_Journey_2.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2810051/The_Blooming_Journey_2.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Building on the popularity of season 1, season 2 features five of China's renowned female celebrities alongside two young companions. The format breaks away from task-driven reality competition: each episode is anchored in a meaningful theme, with cast members exploring new challenges that highlight collaboration, self-discovery, and the power of personal stories. This season's journey covers diverse destinations – Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Chongqing, Quanzhou, Hong Kong, and Macao – giving viewers a panoramic look at the broader Chinese culture.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Performance data demonstrates robust anticipation and engagement: Season 2 generated over a thousand trending topics on social media prior to premiere, reflecting the powerful draw of iQIYI's original programming. Season 1 achieved notable success, with iQIYI's content popularity index surpassing 8,000 and leading third-party rankings such as Enlightent, Dengta, Maoyan, Endata, Guduo, and Vlinkage. The show has not only captured young audiences, but also reached lower-tier markets and more senior demographic.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Importantly, \"The Blooming Journey\" makes a real-world impact. The show also helped bring new attention to Lugu Lake in Yunnan Province, where visitor numbers rose 42.93% year-on-year during the 2025 National Day Holiday period. Many travelers were inspired by the show to explore local traditions, including sunrise watching and Mosuo cultural experiences.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"The Blooming Journey\" epitomizes iQIYI's ongoing commitment to premium, IP-driven entertainment. Other long-running variety shows – such as \"The Rap of China,\" \"The King of Stand-Up Comedy,\" and \"Become a Farmer\" – further demonstrate iQIYI's leadership in delivering high-quality, diverse content that shapes consumer preferences and boosts local tourism.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">With its strong portfolio of seasonal IP and cross-border format innovation, iQIYI remains at the forefront of China's entertainment landscape, providing fresh perspectives, championing inclusive storytelling, and connecting audiences to the places and cultures they see on screen.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Contact:<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>iQIYI Press, <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:press@qiyi.com\" tabindex=\"0\">press@qiyi.com</a></p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1802392/iQIYI_New_Logo_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1802392/iQIYI_New_Logo_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN12135&amp;sd=2025-10-31\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqiyi-launches-the-blooming-journey-season-2-cementing-its-leadership-in-seasonal-ips-and-female-centric-storytelling-302600689.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqiyi-launches-the-blooming-journey-season-2-cementing-its-leadership-in-seasonal-ips-and-female-centric-storytelling-302600689.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE iQIYI Inc.</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

The agreement covers more than 100 MW of JA Solar's DeepBlue 4.0 Pro modules for a large-scale solar project in Western Australia, marking the largest collaboration to date between the two companies.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2809997/signing_ceremony.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2809997/signing_ceremony.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Built on years of close technical cooperation, this agreement combines the complementary strengths of JA Solar and 5B to deliver greater value for PV developers. JA Solar's high-efficiency modules, renowned for their reliability, have been rigorously tested and optimized for seamless integration with 5B's Maverick system. The Maverick is a prefabricated, re-deployable solar array designed so that solar farms can be built faster, safer, and at lower cost.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Certified to withstand wind speeds of up to 93 meters per second, the Maverick system provides exceptional durability in extreme weather, a timely advantage as Australia enters its peak storm season. When paired with JA Solar's DeepBlue 4.0 Pro modules, the combined solution enables fast-track installation, reduced balance-of-system costs, and consistent energy output. This synergy results in shorter project timelines, lower operational risks, and stronger returns for customers operating in challenging environments.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The signing ceremony brought together senior leaders from both companies, including Daniel Li (VP, East Asia &amp; South Pacific, JA Solar) and David Griffin (CEO of 5B), alongside key regional and technical heads. Their presence highlighted the strategic depth of the partnership and the alignment across commercial, engineering, and market development teams.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"This agreement is more than a supply contract, it is a blueprint for how global technology and local ingenuity can come together to deliver real-world impact,\" said Daniel Li. \"By combining JA Solar's proven module performance with 5B's advanced deployment technology, we are empowering customers with solutions that are bankable, scalable, and built for Australia's unique conditions.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The partnership between JA Solar and 5B reflects a shared vision of accelerating the transition to renewable energy through technical excellence, operational synergy, and deep local collaboration, delivering greater value for the customers who are building the future.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN12092&amp;sd=2025-10-30\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ja-solar-and-5b-sign-strategic-module-supply-agreement-for-100mw-project-in-western-australia-302600658.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ja-solar-and-5b-sign-strategic-module-supply-agreement-for-100mw-project-in-western-australia-302600658.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE JA Solar Technology Co., Ltd.</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

Adjusting the CPI to narrow the impact of inflation to focus specifically on middle-income families and their purchase patterns, inflation rose to 3.4% year over year. The cost of necessity items as used in the HBI™ metric (food, utilities, gas, auto insurance, and health care) for middle-income Americans is up 3.2% year over year.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index™ metric, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.householdbudgetindex.com%2F&amp;esheet=54348430&amp;newsitemid=20251030964186&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.householdbudgetindex.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=92b88b8368b1fc3f22bc025993a7c879\" tabindex=\"0\">www.householdbudgetindex.com</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Note on Availability of Primerica HBI™ Data</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica’s Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) metric is constructed monthly using current and historical government data including information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the U.S. Census Bureau (Census). As a result of the government shutdown that began October 1, 2025, the BLS published the delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Friday, October 24 and release of economic data and active data collection has ceased. Primerica generated September HBI™ data with an estimated value for the Census data that will be updated once the September data becomes available. However, no data collection by the BLS or Census is expected to occur for the month of October, thus Primerica will be unable to release HBI™ data in November. If these circumstances continue, there may be an impact on the timing or content of future HBI™ data. The HBI™ metric will resume once the data is available again.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) Data</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) data is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">®</span>. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, auto insurance, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica’s HBI™ metric was created to fill an information void around the economy’s impact on middle-income families. Metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure overall inflation but don’t offer a clear picture of how it impacts middle-income Americans. Middle-income households play a key role in driving consumer spending and the overall economy as they account for over 55% of the U.S. population. The purchasing power of middle-income families are a key barometer of real-time economic trends. Understanding middle-income households’ purchasing power is important because it shows whether they are gaining financial ground or falling behind.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe HBI™ data uses January 2019 as its baseline, with the value set to 100% at that point in time.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPeriodically, prior HBI™ values may be modified due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the December 2024 release of the index, the expenditure weights have been updated to the most recent (Q1 2024) data and auto insurance has been added to the group of necessity items.
