Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Lakeland was experiencing significant, sustained issues with its Pacific Helmets and Jolly businesses, including, inter alia, shipping-related delays, production issues, and slower than expected rollout of new products; (2) accordingly, defendants overstated the anticipated and actual positive impact of these businesses on Lakeland's financial results, as well as the overall strength and quality of Pacific Helmets' and Jolly's respective operations; (3) Lakeland's business and financial results were significantly deteriorating because of, inter alia, tariff-related headwinds and timing, certification delays, and material flow issues in its acquired businesses; (4) accordingly, defendants overstated the strength of their tariff mitigation measures and \"small, strategic, and quick\" (\"SSQ\") M&amp;A strategy; (5) as a result of all the foregoing issues, defendants' financial guidance was unreliable; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Lakeland class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629574-1&amp;h=75577555&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50020&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50020\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50020</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. OpenAI shut down Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account after detecting a violation of its policy but didn't notify police. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon said he's also scheduled to speak to OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman next week. A spokeswoman for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Solomon said the timing and location have yet to be determined. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A meeting with Solomon marks the second senior Canadian politician Altman has agreed to speak with. British Columbia Premier David Eby said he's also set to speak to Altman, and Eby added he wants the CEO to be cognizant of the pain that families in Tumbler Ridge are feeling. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Online platforms have long debated how to balance questions of privacy with public safety in their decisions to alert law enforcement about certain users. That debate has now pulled in the AI companies that power the chatbots to which people are confiding the most intimate details of their private thoughts and lives. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In its letter to Solomon, OpenAI divulged that Van Rootselaar had a second ChatGPT account. Among OpenAI's pledges is a commitment to strengthen detection systems to prevent efforts to evade safeguards. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Taylor Owen, a public-policy professor at Montreal's McGill University with a specialty in media and ethics, said OpenAI has now publicly acknowledged its previous safety protocols were inadequate, and that Van Rootselaar's ability to create a second account discloses a previously unknown system error. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"It means the threshold that governed the original decision, the one that resulted in Canadian police not being contacted about violent content flagged by the company's own systems, was one the company itself now considers inadequate,\" Owen said. OpenAI's pledges, he added, follows a pattern among social-media platforms \"where product safety changes come only after an incident forces them.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon said he will press Altman about ensuring the pledges are fully implemented and enforced. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"We will be seeking further clarity on how human review is conducted and whether Canadian context and best practices are appropriately embedded in those decisions,\" the minister said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon added that intends to meet other major digital platforms in the coming weeks to advocate for a consistent approach on protecting youths and the public. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 17:29 ET (22:29 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

He added that the Department of Defense and other U.S. agencies have six months to phase out Anthropic's technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. On Thursday, Anthropic said it would work to enable a \"smooth transition\" to another provider. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's announcement comes after days of public and private back-and-forth negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic that occasionally turned ugly. After Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei defended his company's refusal to budge on Thursday, a Pentagon official accused him of trying to \"personally control the U.S. military.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex,\" the official, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Emil Michael, wrote on X. Michael, a former executive at Uber Technologies (UBER), also accused Anthropic of having a plan to \"impose\" its values on Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conflict stems from Anthropic's contract with the Defense Department, which is worth up to $200 million. Anthropic has drawn a line in the sand over how the agency can use its technology. Specifically, Anthropic doesn't want its products to be used to develop autonomous weapons or for mass surveillance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon has said it has \"no interest\" in using AI for those purposes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,\" Amodei wrote Thursday. \"Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today's technology can safely and reliably do.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But that didn't square with a Jan. 9 memo handed down by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that calls for AI labs to amend their defense contracts to allow \"any lawful use\" of their technology. Hegseth gave the department 180 days to insert that standard into any contract that involves procuring AI services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"DoD does not want a private company's usage policy to function as a veto over lawful military applications,\" Jessica Tillipman, a professor at George Washington University's law school who specializes in government procurement law, told MarketWatch over email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If DoD makes this the default clause across all AI vendors, it eliminates vendor-by-vendor negotiation over acceptable use and signals that firms unwilling to accept that baseline will be replaced,\" Tillipman said. \"It sounds like boring contract boilerplate, but it is really about procurement leverage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this week, the Pentagon had given Anthropic a Friday deadline to agree to its terms. A spokesperson for the Defense Department said the agency had no further comment on the matter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hegseth had earlier threatened to declare Anthropic a \"supply-chain risk\" and force the company to agree to its terms using a Korean War-era law if it didn't capitulate ahead of the Friday deadline. It's unclear whether Anthropic could still be labeled a supply-chain risk, a designation previously applied only to foreign companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before this week, Claude was the only AI model approved for classified use in the Pentagon. Claude was even used, through a Palantir Technologies (PLTR) partnership, to help the U.S. capture Venezuela's then president, Nicolás Maduro, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Elon Musk's xAI signed a deal to allow its controversial Grok model to be used for classified purposes earlier this week. Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns over potential safety issues with Grok, the Journal reports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A senior Pentagon official told MarketWatch that other companies are close to a similar agreement that would allow their AI models to be used for classified work. OpenAI and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have made versions of their AI models, ChatGPT and Gemini, available on the Defense Department's GenAI.mil enterprise platform used by civilian and military personnel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Representatives for Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this month, Anthropic said it had raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation and disclosed $14 billion in annual run-rate revenue, driven mostly by increasing enterprise adoption of products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Amazon, Nvidia and SoftBank pour $110 billion into OpenAI - raising the stakes for AI monetization </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. OpenAI shut down Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account after detecting a violation of its policy but didn't notify police. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon said he's also scheduled to speak to OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman next week. A spokeswoman for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 16:53 ET (21:53 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
