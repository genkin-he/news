            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment, until they are 18.\" (Photo subjects are models.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm thinking of retiring at 65, when my twins will be 15. I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I'm in the home stretch': I'm 80. Do I leave my kids a 'Magnificent Seven' dynasty trust or a brokerage account? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My son's credit-card company will write off $10K on a $25K debt.

The outlook of the FSR is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGolden Tree is a subsidiary of Iris Financial Services Limited (IFS) and is owned ultimately by Springbrook Capital Ltd., a private holding company with diversified operations in insurance and financial services.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Credit Ratings (ratings) reflect Golden Tree’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe revised outlook to positive from stable of the Long-Term ICR reflects AM Best’s expectation that Golden Tree will be able to maintain improvements in its strongest balance sheet assessment driven by further growth in the United States, while sustaining its favorable trend in operating performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGolden Tree was established in 2015, as a segregated portfolio company. In 2019, the company was licensed as a Class 3A insurer under Bermuda laws to provide reinsurance capacity for commercial credit and credit life risks as part of the group’s retrocession cover, with geographic exposure mainly to Colombia’s insurance market, as well as a growing presence in the United States.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings also reflect Golden Tree’s sound operating performance, improving business profile and affiliation to Iris Financial Services, which provides synergies and operating efficiencies, as well as an appropriate ERM framework. Offsetting these positive rating factors are Golden Tree’s historic concentration in one business line and the strong competitive environment in its target geographic market of Colombia. Nevertheless, the company has expanded beyond its core market in other geographies with new specialty lines and by providing coverage to third parties.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGolden Tree’s balance sheet strength level of strongest is underpinned by a capital base reflecting consistent growth according to a 18.4% compound annual growth rate, in conjunction with its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Additionally, the company’s capital base has strengthened over time as a result of its sound underwriting practices. In 2024, the company sustained profitability mainly through underwriting, enabling it to generate a return-on-equity ratio of 24%. AM Best expects Golden Tree to maintain its important role in the group’s strategy. AM Best’s expectation comes amid healthy growth prospects and consistent profitability that is generated by business from the group´s proprietary managing general agent, which also has contributed to improve Golden Tree’s geographic footprint in the United States. Investment income, driven by a diversified strategy, has continued to support Golden Tree’s results further; however, the company is not dependent on this revenue to achieve positive bottom-line results.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFactors that could lead to positive rating actions for Golden Tree include an enhanced balance sheet strength driven by further growth in the United States and increased business diversification. Factors that could lead to negative rating actions include a material loss of capital, either from a substantial decline in profitability, due to new business volatility or execution risk, or an aggressive dividend policy, which reduces risk-adjusted capitalization to a level that no longer supports Golden Tree’s ratings.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

This release contains forward-looking information about, among other topics, Pfizer’s proposed acquisition of Metsera that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks and uncertainties related to the impact of Novo Nordisk’s proposal on the proposed acquisition; risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing the proposed acquisition (including the failure to obtain the requisite vote by Metsera stockholders) in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including the possibility that the proposed acquisition does not close; the possibility that competing offers may be made or accepted; the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated; risks related to the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including Metsera’s ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and other clinical and scientific personals; negative effects of this announcement or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on the market price of Pfizer’s or Metsera’s common stock and/or operating results; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed acquisition or Metsera’s business; other business effects and uncertainties, including the effects of industry, market, business, economic, political or regulatory conditions;

future business combinations or disposals; uncertainties regarding the commercial success of Metsera’s pipeline products or Pfizer’s commercialized and/or pipeline products; risks associated with Metsera conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies outside of the United States;

risks associated with initial, preliminary or interim data; the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from the clinical studies; whether and when drug applications may be filed in any jurisdictions for Pfizer’s or Metsera’s pipeline products for any potential indications; whether and when any such applications may be approved by regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the product's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the product's efficacy and, if approved, whether any such products will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such products; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19;

(Patria Re) (Mexico). AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” (Good) of Patria Re’s ultimate parent, Peña Verde, S.A.B. (Peña Verde) (Mexico). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Per AM Best’s criteria procedure on insurance holding companies, Peña Verde’s rating reflects a standard notching from Patria Re’s Long-Term ICR.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Patria Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe stable outlooks reflect Patria Re’s ability to maintain a stable and profitable operation along with a strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), while implementing its business expansion strategy.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re is Mexico's only locally registered reinsurer, founded in 1953. The company has a strong niche position in Mexico and in other Latin America markets, which allows it to accept profitable business selectively while maintaining a diversified product portfolio tailored to specific markets, where it has developed very strong client relationships. This strategy has resulted in consistently favorable underwriting results over the past few years.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re’s balance sheet strength assessment of strongest is supported by that same assessment on the company’s level of risk-adjusted capitalization, low underwriting leverage, a robust reinsurance program placed among counterparties with a strong security level and strong liquidity metrics. The ratings also reflect its comprehensive ERM infrastructure and expansive knowledge of its core markets in Latin America, which reflects the company’s smooth implementation of its expansion strategy with a stable overseas operation outside its niche market.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDespite limitations posted by catastrophe reserve development, Patria Re reported positive bottom-line results in 2024, mainly driven by favorable underwriting results. The company’s strong underwriting practices allowed Patria Re to report a bottom-line result of MXN 1 billion. The company’s efforts to maintain stable claims and management expenses have resulted in a profitable first six months for 2025, with a bottom-line of MXN 347 million, despite the limitations of catastrophe reserve development.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFactors that could lead to positive rating actions for the company include a consistent upward trend in profitability metrics that compare well with the strong operating performance, while maintaining its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as well as the continued and successful operation of its overseas expansion. Factors that may lead to negative rating actions include a sustained deterioration in risk-adjusted capitalization, driven either by unfavorable results or a significant cash withdrawal.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.
