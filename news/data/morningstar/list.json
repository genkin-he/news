Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were down about 6% each. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV) were down more than 3% even as analysts at Cowen raised their rating on the stock to buy on Friday and praised the industry's backdrop. Such ratings changes usually provide a boost for a company's shares. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil futures jumped on Friday after nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva ended with no concrete agreements. Negotiations are set to resume next week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many airlines shield themselves from volatility in the price of fuel, which makes up a large part of their operational costs, by hedging it, usually using financial derivatives to try to spread their risk. But there has been a clear negative correlation between oil futures prices and airline stocks in recent years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Signs that inflation may persist and broader fears about artificial intelligence and tech stocks were also at play for U.S. equities, with some fearing that March will be another tumultuous month for the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. airlines enjoy broad-based demand and capacity is \"rational,\" the Cowen analysts said in their note about Southwest. The \"rising industry tide\" bodes well for the company, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The airline for years stuck with a one-size-fits-all approach that fell out of sync with competitors, which dove deeper into tiered fares and charging for different services as a way to drum up more profits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amid pressure from activist investors, Southwest announced sweeping changes a couple of years ago, including the end of its hallmark policies of open seating and no fees for checked baggage. It started charging baggage fees earlier this year, while extra-legroom and assigned-seating options went live in January. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -CLAUDIA ASSIS </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, among other things: statements regarding the completion of the offering; the satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the offering; the Company's future operating or financial results; the Company's liquidity; and other factors listed from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent occurring events or circumstances, or changes in its expectations, except as may be required by law. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot assure you that such expectations will turn out to be correct, and the Company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results and encourages investors to review other factors that may affect its future results in the Company's annual report on Form 20-F and its other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Investor Contact</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Sherry Zheng<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>WAVECREST GROUP INC.<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Phone: +1 718-213-7386<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Email: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:sherry@wavecrestipo.com\" tabindex=\"0\">sherry@wavecrestipo.com</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN98018&amp;sd=2026-02-27\"/></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mdjm-ltd-announces-pricing-of-2-5-million-registered-direct-offering-302699864.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mdjm-ltd-announces-pricing-of-2-5-million-registered-direct-offering-302699864.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE MDJM LTD</p></span>\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN98018&amp;Transmission_Id=202602271341PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN98018&amp;DateId=20260227\"/></picture></span>\n</div>",
