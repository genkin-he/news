data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European indexes were lower across the board Friday, with this week's highly anticipated trade agreement between the U.S and China receiving a muted response. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market watchers said China appeared set to maintain the rare-earth curbs introduced in the spring, and businesses could expect more rocky times ahead for U.S.-China commerce. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bucking the trend were Spain's Puig Brands,  Germany's Fuchs , which both rose after earnings and London-listed Fresnillo which bought Probe Gold, gaining a foothold in the Canadian gold sector. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Eurzone inflation slowed in October to just above the ECB's target,  largely due to due to a smaller increase in food prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting, when the eight OPEC+ oil-producing countries were set to decide on any production changes for November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks to Watch </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The relatively calm ECB meeting was still good news for European bank equities , Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We continue to see loan growth and an upward sloping yield curve as important factors helping bank earnings and the gradual improvement in valuations.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     KBW's earnings forecasts for the continent's banks assume that rates stay at current levels until 2028, however, another potential 25 basis point cut wouldn't move estimates much given that, as banks increase the resilience of their net interest income, each 25 basis point parallel shift is worth only around 1% of sector earnings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. Markets: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stock futures climbed after strong earnings from Amazon  and Apple  reassured investors about the trajectory of Big Tech. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Trump urged Senate Republicans to end the filibuster--the longstanding rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation--in order to reopen the government without the support of Democrats. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Forex: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The euro-dollar exchange rate remained driven by dollar moves  following the ECB meeting, ING said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's some speculation in the market that the euro could fall below $1.15 but this looks unlikely given prospects of further weak U.S. jobs data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The eurozone economy is also showing a slight improvement, it added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The dollar remained higher,  supported by reduced bets for another rate cut in December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If the government shutdown continues, it would not be obvious that the Fed will continue with rate cuts,\" Jefferies said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sterling would face elevated volatility if U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves unexpectedly resigned , ING said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bonds: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Eurozone government bond yields rose , absorbing the ECB's policy meeting on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's becoming increasingly clear that the bar for another rate cut has risen higher than markets are currently pricing,\" Fidelity International said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Societe Generale expected the term premium in 10-year Bund yields to increase by between 25 basis points and 55 basis points by the end of 2026 , while volatility remains low. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Admittedly, the perception of euro duration risk remains low, which is curbing the forces driving term premium rebuilding.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury yields edged higher  across the curve, except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small following this week's major central bank policy decisions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Barclays strategists recommended 3.61% as an entry level for the two-year Treasurys  saying it believed two-year yields can fall by 25 basis points. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     TD Securities doesn't expect Treasury auction size increases until at least late 2026,  with the Treasury likely keeping guidance unchanged. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Treasury should continue bringing more supply in bills as coupon auction sizes remain unchanged--especially as QT is coming to an end and reserve management purchases may be in the cards in 2026.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Belgium hasn't yet submitted its draft budget plans to the European Commission , leaving the country with some risks, Citi said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BlueBay Asset Management said Treasury yields were approaching levels attractive enough to buy at. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Energy: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3%  ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, the trade agreement with China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" </p>\n<p

China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December rate cuts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We expect gold prices to remain elevated in the coming weeks, especially as central bank purchases remain high,\" BMI said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, \"risks are slated to the downside as the Fed has downplayed the possibility of another cut in December and the trade deal between the U.S. and China has abated a lot of the uncertainty in the market.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UOB maintained its positive outlook for gold and raised price forecasts  to $4,000 by 4Q 2025, $4,100 by 1Q 2026, $4,200 by 2Q 2026, and $4,300 by 3Q 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     EMEA HEADLINES </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Audi Cuts Profitability Guidance Again </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Audi cut its full-year margin guidance again as U.S. tariffs, restructuring costs and the postponement of an electric-vehicle platform weigh on profitability at the German automaker. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We are responding to the challenging overall economic situation and intensified competition with stringent cost control measures and are continuing to work on our financial performance,\" Audi Chief Financial Officer Juergen Rittersberger said. \"At the same time, we are making our business model future-proof and resilient.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Danske Bank Expects Earnings to Land at Upper End of Guidance Range </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Danske Bank expects to report full-year earnings at the top end of its guidance range as net interest income so far this year has been resilient, while fee income has remained strong and impairments low. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Copenhagen-based bank on Friday posted a third-quarter net profit of 5.52 billion Danish kroner ($855 million), down from 6.17 billion kroner a year earlier, while net interest income fell 1% to 9.07 billion kroner. A company-compiled consensus had expected net profit at 5.42 billion kroner with net interest income of 8.98 billion kroner. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Thyssenkrupp Steel Appoints Marie Jaroni as Chief Executive </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Thyssenkrupp Steel appointed Marie Jaroni as chief executive and reshuffled its executive team, weeks after its parent company received an offer for the business from Jindal Steel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The German steel conglomerate on Friday said it extended Jaroni's contract for a further five years, as well as the contract of Chief Financial Officer Philipp Conze. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     GLOBAL NEWS </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More Home Purchases Are Falling Through in an Uncertain Economy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trish DaCosta saved for more than five years to buy a home in Nashville, Tenn., and was thrilled when her offer on a roughly $400,000, three-bedroom house was accepted. Then, a month before closing earlier this year, she was laid off from her job in public relations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When she learned she lost her job, the first call she made was to her real-estate agent to pull the offer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wall Street Is Punishing Stocks When Earnings Fail to Sparkle </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market isn't far from all-time highs and many experts would argue that stocks are priced for perfection. That is a problem because top companies like Meta Platforms and Chipotle are reporting earnings and issuing outlooks that are a little less than perfect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chipotle illustrates what is happening. The popular Mexican food chain's results, released late Wednesday, weren't bad per se: Earnings and revenue matched Wall Street's forecasts. But the company said same-store sales for the fourth quarter are now likely to decline, a sign of slowing demand that Wall Street wasn't expecting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech Is Spending More Than Ever on AI and It's Still Not Enough </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Silicon Valley's biggest companies are already planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year. They all say it's nowhere near enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta Platforms says it is still running up against capacity constraints as it tries to train new AI models and power its existing products at the same time. Microsoft says it is seeing so much customer demand for its data-center-driven services that it plans to double its data-center footprint in the next two years. And Amazon.com says it is racing to bring more cloud capacity online as soon as it can. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump Pivots Second Term Toward Foreign Policy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BUSAN, South Korea-President Trump wrapped up his six-day swing through Asia by touting trade deals and new investments in the U.S. But as he arrives back in Washington, the gold-plated receptions abroad are giving way to a shuttered government and deepening voter anxiety about the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The split screen sheds light on why Trump has turned much of his second-term attention to foreign policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Long Road to a U.S.-China Trade Pact </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 07:15 ET (11:15 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account. I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I have a considerable amount of unrealized capital gains in this fund and can't decide whether selling some or all of it and paying the taxes makes sense, or if I should wait through the coming decline. I am 78 and retired. My wife and I have an income of $200,000 due to IRA withdrawals.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A word of caution for him and everyone else: If you have $100,000 or $1 million in your tech-heavy mutual fund, you are sitting pretty. It will receive a step-up in basis as an inheritance. With IRA withdrawals and Social Security, this man is enjoying some well-earned gravy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors should not make decisions about their portfolio based on a feared downturn in the S&amp;P 500 SPX. You will see arguments for and against whether there is a big correction ahead. Instead, adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All that tech money won't do you much good sitting in your bank account. Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make the December quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity, the \"seven-year rule\" states that you should only invest money in the market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
