I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Luckily, I did not mix our finances': My husband is 7 years younger and has dementia.

I have $140,000 in savings and about $260,000 in my retirement fund. I take in about $2,200 in monthly rent from four properties and will get about $700 in Social Security. All of my homes and vehicles are paid for and I have no debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If I retire next October, I will get about $3,600 a month in my retirement. If I work an extra year I'll get about $4,600 a month in my retirement. Taxes and insurance for all 4 homes comes out to be around $1,200 a month. I don't want to worry about money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Will it be OK to retire? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hopeful Retiree </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I'm planning to retire at 65 when my twins are 15. How will this impact their healthcare coverage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't have enough money for the kind of travel and leisure activities you would like to pursue in retirement, work for as long as you can. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Hopeful, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wait to retire and sell your rentals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's the short answer. But I have more to say, so buckle up. Your rentals bring in $1,000 a month after expenses and all the hassle of being a landlord on four separate properties. You're giving yourself a lot of work for a modest return. Let's say you sold your properties and made $500,000 and invested that in the S&amp;P 500 SPX; if you earned an average of 7% a year on that investment, you could still withdraw 4% a year ($20,000 annually or $1,667 a month), which would last you the next 30 years or more. It's a better return, although you don't have expenses to write off. But it's also less work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Waiting another year to retire is a no-brainer. You will get another $1,000 a month in your pension. But examine the fine balance between your income and expenses. You don't say what your annual expenses are now and/or will be in retirement, but it's probably safe to say you're close to exceeding them. The average spending for those aged 65 or older is roughly $4,345 monthly, according to RetireGuide.com. This covers housing, food, healthcare and entertainment. In their survey, nearly half spent under $2,000 monthly, a third spent $2,000-$3,999, and almost 20% spent over $3,999. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't have enough money for the kind of travel and leisure activities you would like to pursue in retirement, work for as long as you can, even part time. If you continue to work while receiving Social Security benefits, you will continue to pay Social Security tax. The age at which you \"break even\" - making it worthwhile to forego benefits for a larger sum at a later date - should not be the only basis for what you choose to do; your decision depends on a range of factors, including your longevity, income, marital status, and predictions for your cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Claiming Social Security </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For people like you who were born in 1960 or later, your full retirement age is 67. The earliest you can claim is 62, but you get reduced benefits; at that age, you get 36 months of delayed retirement credit, which increases every month past the full retirement age until you reach 70. (If you were born in 1957, your maximum retirement benefit would be 128% of your full retirement benefit at 70 years of age; this assumes FRA starts at 66 and 6 months. If you were born in 1955 and delay Social Security until age 70, you get 130.7%; your FRA is 66 and 2 months.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security is an insurance policy against living longer than you think. Of course, the best time to start taking Social Security is when you stop working. That's when you will need it the most. Some people will advise you to take your benefits at 67, pointing to all the things that can go wrong over the next 10 years, particularly with your health. If you are more optimistic, you're healthy and have \"good genes\" - that is, your parents lived to a long age - and you don't smoke or drink to excess, you may feel OK waiting until you are 70 and collecting roughly 24% more depending on your tax credits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm taking you at your word, and you say, \"I don't want to worry about money.\" If that is your guiding light, see these next few years as a gift and aim to reduce as much work-related stress as possible. You could, for example, start taking up some retirement-related activities now for a soft launch into retirement and/or ask your boss if you can work from home a couple of days a week (although this can be a controversial topic at some workplaces). The good news is, you can probably afford to retire next year if you really want to, but know that your decision will be hard to reverse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500': Do I sell my tech stocks before it's too late? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I think we've been lied to': Who exactly is considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm a veteran, 57, and on disability benefits.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Quest Insurance Group Limited</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best </strong>has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of B (Fair) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “bb+” (Fair) of Quest Insurance Group Limited (Quest) (New Zealand). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Quest’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as adequate, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings also factor in the neutral impact from the company’s ultimate majority shareholder, Federal Pacific Group Limited.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nQuest’s balance sheet strength assessment is underpinned by its risk-adjusted capitalisation, which was at the very strong level as of fiscal year-end (31 March) 2025, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Prospectively, AM Best expects the company’s risk-adjusted capitalisation to remain at least at the strong level, supported by internal capital generation. AM Best still expects the company’s regulatory solvency position to remain appropriate, supported by prudent capital management. Offsetting balance sheet strength factors include the company’s small absolute capital base of NZD 21.8 million, which increases the sensitivity of the risk-adjusted capitalisation to stress scenarios, such as outsized dividend payments or fluctuations in prospective performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses Quest’s operating performance as adequate, supported by its robust underwriting performance and positive investment returns. In fiscal year 2025, the company reported a combined ratio (net/net, IFRS 17) of 89.5% and a return-on-equity ratio of 23.6%. Quest’s investment income remains a stable contributor to its overall profits, with the company reporting a net investment yield (including gains/losses) of 4.5% in fiscal year 2025. AM Best expects prospective performance to remain supportive of the adequate assessment over the near term, although the company’s rapid business growth and risk profile changes could drive potential volatility.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nQuest’s business profile assessment of limited reflects its small market presence, geographic concentration and relatively niche product offering, largely as a provider of comprehensive vehicle insurance (CVI) and mechanical breakdown insurance (MBI) in New Zealand. The company’s scale of operation has increased significantly over the last five years, driven mostly by its third-party distributor of motor-related insurance. AM Best notes that Quest’s reliance on its third-party distributor has increased in recent years, with the related distribution channel accounting for over two-thirds of the gross premiums in fiscal-year 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses Quest’s ERM as appropriate given the current size and complexity of its operations. Nonetheless, AM Best expects continual development of Quest’s ERM capabilities to support its growing operations and risk profile. Following the conclusion of a recent regulatory investigation, Quest was issued a formal warning letter over potential contraventions of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010, with no penalties imposed. The company has since engaged in a process to strengthen its risk management capabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

            "title": "Otter Tail Power Company Requests Minnesota Rate Increase",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Otter Tail Power Company Requests Minnesota Rate Increase</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOtter Tail Power Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Otter Tail Corporation (Nasdaq: OTTR), filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to increase electric rates for its Minnesota customers. This request initiates an 18- to 24-month review process during which the PUC evaluates the company’s costs for providing electric service and then sets rates in a manner the PUC deems reasonable for both the company providing the service and the customers who depend on it.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our customers, employees, friends, and neighbors see the costs of goods and services going up all around us, and we know that’s not easy,” said Otter Tail Power President Tim Rogelstad. “We’ve taken a hard look at our operations to manage expenses and improve efficiency before asking our customers to pay more. This request reflects what’s necessary to continue delivering the dependable service our communities count on.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs part of the state regulatory process, Otter Tail Power requested PUC permission to increase rates on an interim basis beginning January 1, 2026. If the PUC approves this request, the overall interim bill increase of approximately 12.6% remains in place until the PUC completes its highly structured review designed to balance public interest, utility viability, and legal rigor. During this 18- to 24-month interim period, a typical residential customer’s bill would increase approximately $13.15 a month; a typical business customer’s bill would increase approximately $43.67 a month. Each customer’s interim increase will be different based on the rates they’re on and how much energy they use.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe company anticipates the PUC will make its final rate decision in the first quarter of 2027; final rates likely will not impact customers’ bills until the second or third quarter of 2027.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf the PUC approves Otter Tail Power’s final rate request as filed, the net increase over what customers pay today would be approximately $44.8 million, or 17.7%. A typical residential customer’s bill would increase approximately $18.14 a month; a typical business customer’s bill would increase approximately $73.20 a month. As with interim rates, each customer’s final increase will be different based on the rates they’re on and how much energy they use. If final rates are lower than interim rates, customers will receive refunds with interest. If final rates are higher, the company won’t collect the difference.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">What customers see in return for this rate increase</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAccording to Rogelstad, while inflation is one of the primary drivers behind this request, customers benefit from infrastructure investments that support immediate and long-term reliability; grid resilience efforts that reduce, and potentially prevent, service disruptions; and the transition to renewable resources.\n\n</p><ol class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--ordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Infrastructure investments.</strong> To support immediate and long-term reliability, Otter Tail Power is investing in the infrastructure that moves electricity to homes and businesses. For example, the company is extending the life of aging infrastructure by replacing cross arms, poles, and insulators that have been in place for 50+ years, as well as adding new infrastructure.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Grid resilience.</strong> Grid resilience efforts include expanding underground lines, now covering 28% of the company’s distribution system, to reduce exposure to storms and improve reliability. The company also is increasing vegetation management near power lines to prevent service disruptions.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Energy transition. </strong>Otter Tail Power is transitioning to a larger percentage of renewable energy generation resources for Minnesota customers. These zero-fuel-cost resources, along with tax credits, have helped ease the transition. The company is including in this request the costs associated with no longer serving Minnesota customers with power from its co-owned, coal-fired Coyote Station in North Dakota by the end of 2031.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Inflation. </strong>Otter Tail Power’s last Minnesota rate review was based on the cost of doing business in 2021. Since then, inflation has increased the cost of materials, and the labor and equipment needed to build and maintain the electric grid. According to Rogelstad, the company is managing these impacts through smart planning and efficient operations, but the cost of providing service is more than it can recover through current rates.\n\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“We understand rising electric costs are challenging for our customers,” said Rogelstad. “We also take very seriously our wholehearted commitment, and our regulatory obligation, to reliably serve those customers. This request is not being driven by data centers, despite what some national headlines might suggest. We would not ask for this rate increase if it didn’t reflect the real costs of maintaining and strengthening our electric system.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAccording to Rogelstad, even with this increase Otter Tail Power customers will keep paying less for the energy they need to power their homes and businesses than they would almost anywhere else in the region. “While this is an impressive statement, we aren’t competing against our neighbor’s rates. We’re competing against our own,” said Rogelstad. “Our ability to keep our rates among the lowest in the region demonstrates our tradition of working hard for the economic viability of our customers and communities, and we’ll keep that tradition going.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nExcept for historical information contained here, the statements in this release are forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Claudia Assis and Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The decline in oil prices are hurting earnings for the oil giants, but they are boosting production and generating more cash to return to shareholders </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An Exxon gas station in Miami. Exxon and Chevron are slated to report earnings on Friday, after a string of upbeat quarters for the two integrated giants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling oil prices continued to hurt earnings for both Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp., but both oil giants beat Wall Street's profit expectations on Friday as they boosted production to record levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The companies also pleased investors by generating more cash from operations and increasing shareholder returns, with Exxon Mobil raising its quarterly dividend by 4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon is \"a focused, disciplined machine,\" with its holdings in Guyana and West Texas' Permian basin, plus its liquified natural gas business, its top  growth drivers, Melius Research analyst James West said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon's production increased 2.9% to 4.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, including record quarterly production in both the Permian and Guyana. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company raised its dividend to $1.04 a share, from 99 cents a share. At Thursday's closing price of $114.69, that would lift the implied dividend yield to 3.63%, which is more than triple the implied yield for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX of 1.15%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon's net income fell 12.3% to $7.55 billion, while adjusted EPS fell to $1.88 to $1.92 but beat the FactSet consensus of $1.82. The adjusted EPS has now declined for five straight quarters and beat expectations for six straight.  Revenue declined 5.2% to $85.29 billion, missing expectations of $86.47 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An oil glut looms </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron's third-quarter earnings were \"predictably messy\" given the recent Hess acquisition and consolidation, Citi analyst Alastair Syme said. The company presented a better earnings picture than the market had anticipated, however, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are \"encouraging signs of growth,\" and a financial framework that looks \"reasonably well adjusted to a potentially lower oil macro in 2026,\" Syme said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon and Chevron's results come as U.S. oil futures prices (CL.1) have shed 3.2% so far this month, and have fallen 15.8% year to date. There are plenty of worries that oil prices may be headed to their lowest since the pandemic. A World Bank report this week pointed to an oil-supply glut brewing for next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron's  worldwide production rose 21% from a year ago, with U.S. production up 27% to hit new company records, it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the U.S., net oil-equivalent production increased by 435,000 barrels per day to 2.04 million barrels per day, helped by the Hess acquisition and higher production in the Permian Basin and the Gulf of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron kept its quarterly dividend at $1.71 per share, implying a dividend yield of 4.46%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For earnings, Chevron's net income fell 21.1% to $3.54 billion, while adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, of $1.85 were down from $2.51, but beat the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of $1.71. Revenue dropped 2% to $49.73 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $47.23 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron said adjusted free cash flow increased more than 50% to $7 billion, while Exxon said cash flow from operating activities rose 28% to $14.8 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron increased its shareholder returns to $6 billion from $5.5 billion in the previous quarter, while Exxon lifted shareholder returns to $9.4 billion from $9.2 billion, and raised its quarterly dividend to $1.03 a share from 99 cents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The companies' stocks diverged on Friday, with Exxon shares down nearly 1% and Chevron shares gaining more than 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron's results marked the 10th straight quarter that adjusted EPS saw a year-over-year decline, but the third straight quarter that the company beat expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The integrated giants are not the same companies they were a decade ago, with management that is more disciplined and shying away from boom-and-bust cycles, said Morningstar analyst Allen Good. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They have improved their balance sheet and shown capital discipline,\" he said. \"They are still showing relatively strong returns and balance sheets, and they are not overextended.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Their stock trajectories this year seem to support that distinction. Exxon shares are holding on to a 6.6% gain so far in 2025 through Thursday, while Chevron shares are up 6%. However, they have underperformed the broader equity market, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX gaining 16% so far this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
