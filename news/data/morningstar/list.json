Many Americans may turn to high-deductible plans this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     High-deductible health plans can seem like an attractive option for health-insurance shoppers looking to lower their monthly premium  payments. But consumers should consider their health status and cash savings before making the switch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As open enrollment for 2026 health-insurance plans begins Nov. 1, millions of Americans are bracing for premium hikes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Health insurers that sell policies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare, are charging 26% more on average next year, according to nonprofit research group KFF. Employers are also bracing for higher insurance costs, with the average cost of healthcare per worker expected to jump 6.5%, according to a survey from the human-resource advisory firm Mercer. That would be the biggest surge since 2010.  As a result, employees will likely face higher paycheck deductions or more out-of-pocket spending on deductibles or copays, according to Mercer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With premiums on the rise and changes coming to the ACA marketplace, KFF says more people may opt for high-deductible health plans, trading lower monthly premiums for higher upfront costs and the benefit of a tax-advantaged health savings accounts (known as HSAs) - which are typically offered to people who sign up for high-deductible plans. But, according to experts, holders of these high-deductible policies must be financially prepared to cover unexpected health costs, and the best insurance plan for you can vary based on your health status and tax bracket. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People make their insurance decisions based on how they expect to use their healthcare next year, which is tough because it's impossible to forecast healthcare needs, said Drew Shockley, co-founder of health-insurance-planning firm Move Health. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If someone says, 'I'm thinking about getting pregnant and I'm going to have a baby next year?' OK, we can plan for that,\" Shockley said. \"But no one says, 'I think I'm going to have a heart attack next year.' How do we plan for that?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As the financial stakes rise, here's what you need to know to be a savvy health-insurance shopper as open enrollment begins, from the potential downsides of high-deductible health plans to changes in the ACA marketplace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More ACA plans now come with health savings accounts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, reclassified Bronze and Catastrophic ACA plans as high-deductible plans, making them eligible for an HSA in 2026. Information about different coverage tiers is available on Healthcare.gov. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts for medical expenses that can accumulate funds through contributions. They can be invested after reaching a minimum. These accounts are often seen as retirement vehicles because they can grow over time, and after age 65, that money can be withdrawn for nonmedical expenses without penalty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For your plan to be eligible for an HSA, it must have a deductible of at least $1,700 for individual coverage and $3,400 for families, according to Fidelity. (The deductible is the amount of money you have to pay for healthcare before your insurance starts covering some costs.) The HSA contribution limits in 2026 are $4,400 for an individual and $8,750 for family coverage. Those 55 and older who are not enrolled in Medicare can contribute an additional $1,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ask yourself these questions before getting a high-deductible plan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Determining if a high-deductible plan is right for you is largely dependent on your health status and income. Ask yourself the following questions to avoid a future unexpected medical bill you can't pay off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What are my expected healthcare needs for the year? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is one of the questions Todd Calamita, a Charlotte, N.C.-based certified financial planner, asked himself before he and his wife switched to a high-deductible plan a decade ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you're generally healthy, require only preventive care and don't anticipate frequent doctor visits or medications, the lower premiums of an HDHP (high-deductible health plan) can make sense,\" Calamita said. \"However, if you manage chronic conditions or need ongoing prescriptions, an HDHP may be less cost-effective.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, if you go to therapy or a psychiatrist regularly, those visits must be paid out-of-pocket until you hit the deductible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Are online pharmacies cheaper than your local drugstore? How to decide what's best for your healthcare - and your wallet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're generally healthy, consider pairing a high-deductible plan with going to a direct-primary-care doctor to get your basic primary care, said Dr. Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and financial planner. Direct-primary-care providers charge patients a monthly, quarterly or annual fee in lieu of insurance billing for unlimited visits and clinical and laboratory services, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You'll have to pay a subscription fee, but they can provide a lot of what you need that will be way less than your deductible,\" McClanahan said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do I have enough cash to cover the full deductible if needed? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Be comfortable with the possibility of large upfront medical bills because of out-of-pocket costs until the deductible is met. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I quietly chuckle when a doctor's office tells me, 'Don't worry, it's covered by insurance,'\" Calamita said. \"Because I know that I first have to hit $8,300 out-of-pocket cost.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Does it make sense for someone in my tax bracket to use an HSA? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSAs come with a \"triple tax benefit\" - contributions are tax-deductible, funds grow tax-free and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax-free. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because of these benefits, the higher a person's marginal tax bracket is, the more they save up front. For example, a person in the 35% tax bracket - who earns between $256,225 and $640,600 in 2026 - saves 35 cents on every dollar contributed, making the tax deduction more valuable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The new IRS tax brackets for 2026 are here. See where you fit in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Low-income earners can still use HSAs as a vehicle for paying current medical bills with pretax dollars, but it's less valuable as a long-term wealth-building account. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Participating in a health savings account is a lower priority for someone in a lower tax bracket,\" Shockley said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How to be a savvy HSA user </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For those looking at a HSA as a retirement account, Houston, Texas-based certified financial planner Crystal McKeon recommended prioritizing 401(k) contributions if the plan involves an employer match. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You want to get all of that match because you're doubling your money almost, depending on what your employer's match is,\" McKeon said. \"So for me, that's almost always the first place you go for savings.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After contributing up to the employer match, she said, prioritizing the 401(k) versus the HSA depends on which investments are more beneficial. If they're generally the same, McKeon recommended prioritizing making contributions to the HSA because of the triple-tax benefits. Traditional 401(k) withdrawals are generally taxed as ordinary income. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Most Americans are falling behind in saving for retirement. Here's how they can make up the difference. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond saving in the long term, a savvy way to use an HSA is by paying out of pocket for qualified expenses and reimbursing yourself later from the HSA account. This can be particularly effective when you don't have your HSA debit card on you or if you received a medical bill larger than your HSA balance and you want to reimburse yourself over time as your balance grows, according to Fidelity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You might also prefer to use a rewards credit card on qualified expenses to rack up points and then reimburse yourself with HSA funds later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSA-qualified expenses include over-the-counter medications, menstrual products, postpartum care, healthcare-related travel, family planning and substance-abuse treatments, according to MetLife (MET). The One Big Beautiful Bill Act also made direct-primary-care fees qualified HSA medical expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Health insurance is just that. It's insurance against bad things happening,\" McKeon said. \"Whereas if you're able to combine it with a savings feature ... it's not just a safeguard against an emergency; it's actually planning for the long term as well, which I think is a great combination.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's who is facing the biggest jump in ACA premiums </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The biggest ACA-related issue tied up in the current budget fight is whether Congress will extend the enhanced premium tax credits first expanded under the American Rescue Plan and set to expire at the end of 2025. Without an extension, those expanded subsidies - which currently help Americans earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level afford marketplace coverage - would lapse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is barreling toward a terrible record. These financial pain points could end it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An individual earning $62,600 a year, or a family of four making $128,600, represents 400% of the federal poverty level in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. About 1 to 2 million people could lose eligibility for the enhanced subsidies at the end of the year, Shockley said - a relatively small slice of the roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees who now receive financial help. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People making below 400% of the federal poverty level will still qualify for tax credits, but anyone earning even a small amount over the income cap would have to pay the full cost of a marketplace plan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're literally just going back to the original regulations that the Obama administration put in place in 2014,\" Shockley said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  11-01-25 1023ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

Navy Federal Credit Union said it has seen substantially higher uptake in its Paycheck Assistance Program, which offers zero-interest loans for customers impacted by paycheck disruptions, than it did during the 2018-'19 government shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond organizations for federal employees and military members, several large U.S. banks - including Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citibank (C) - are publicizing new offerings for federal employees or encouraging those impacted by the government shutdown to reach out and inquire about available financial assistance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several major banks said they have had a significant increase in customers reaching out to request relief. One bank told MarketWatch it has seen a 10% to 15% uptick in mortgage-forbearance requests this month, though it could not say how many were from federal workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is barreling toward a terrible record.

But consumers seeking relief should ask up front about any strings attached and take steps to protect their credit, experts warn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Take the assistance if you need it, but be aware of what the risks are before you do,\" said Alys Cohen, director of federal housing advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. \"Keep really good records and try to get things in writing from the lender and put things in writing yourself, even to confirm a phone call.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here are four tips to consider before accepting this kind of assistance from your bank or credit union: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read the fine print </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dozens of banks and credit unions are offering assistance for people impacted by the federal shutdown - but the terms of these programs differ widely depending on the financial institution, said Adam Rust, the director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They're providing relief in different types of scenarios, and it's important to understand exactly what you're signing up for when you take one of these arrangements,\" Rust said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, it's crucial to understand the distinction between zero-interest and accrued-interest programs. A zero-interest program means no interest is charged at all during the relief period, while an accrued-interest program pauses payments but continues adding interest in the background, which you'll still owe later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's essential to get details about the hardship program in writing, as well as contact information for a person at the financial institution who can answer questions. A misunderstanding or violation of the terms can wind up harming a person's credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Avoid the danger of a balloon repayment at the end of a forbearance period </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When money gets tight, many prioritize mortgage payments over credit cards, student loans or personal loans, said Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Homes right now are a big asset with a lot of home equity for a lot of people,\" said Kates, who is also a certified financial planner. \"That is a huge asset for them to hold on to.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Inflation is quietly chipping away at most Americans' main source of wealth </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers generally can get a full or partial forbearance, a temporary arrangement with a lender that allows them to pause or reduce their mortgage payments due to a financial hardship. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For those making partial payments, the amount will not count as a full, on-time monthly payment until the total collected equals the full required amount. It can also fall on the consumer to figure out if late fees will be waived during this time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A big danger that comes with mortgage forbearance is a potential balloon payment - when a lump sum of missed payments is owed at the end of a forbearance period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you have to pay a balloon payment at the end of the forbearance and you can't afford that, that could put you in a much more difficult situation,\" Cohen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Luckily, the current standard for many government-backed loans is to extend the term of the mortgage for the number of months missed. For instance, if you missed seven payments during forbearance, the loan is extended by seven months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: A government shutdown would hurt home-buying deals just as buyers are coming off the sidelines </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Keep in mind that interest payments are not paused during the forbearance period, \"but if you're trying to keep your home and stay in your mortgage and you could afford to resume the payments, it's a modest price to pay for getting the forgiveness.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Homeowners also need to stay on top of the forbearance timeline. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"People should find out if they're going to be notified when the forbearance ends or when they have to call to extend it and whether that's on them,\" Cohen said. \"They should have a whole calendar set up so they understand what the timeline is for their arrangement with their lender.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prioritize the roof over your head - but keep in mind these credit risks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lenders reporting payments to credit-reporting bureaus typically mark deferred payments for consumers enrolled in hardship programs with a special code indicating \"no information\" or \"deferral,\" which does not hurt their credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, this is an industry standard rather than legally binding law, so lenders can ignore it, resulting in negative marks for consumers, said Chi Chi Wu, the director of consumer reporting and data advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: This government shutdown could be the longest ever - maybe running until Thanksgiving. What might the economic damage be? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because the guidance isn't enforceable, a consumer's ability to fix the inaccurate negative credit reporting is limited and difficult.

It weighs just over 101 kilograms. With gold now $4,017 an ounce, the value of the item's gold content alone is $10 million - not counting the extra value for artistic merit. Sotheby's says the gold price on the day of auction will determine where the bidding starts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A working gold toilet seems a much better use of bullion than, say, making it into bars and then just having it sit, useless, in vaults in Fort Knox. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fully-functioning solid gold toilet was exhibited and put into public use at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016, with a guard stationed outside the bathroom to protect the work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. government owns 8,133.46 metric tons (8.1 million kilograms) of gold bullion in its national reserves, supposedly held at Fort Knox but subject to the usual conspiracy theories. Based on Cattelan's masterpiece, if melted down that bullion would be enough to make 107,000 of these golden toilets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What could make America greater? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bullion could also usefully be melted down and used for decoration elsewhere in the official White House, or, say, in the \"southern White House\" in Mar-A-Lago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At current, near-record gold prices the reserves are worth just over $1 trillion. They have tripled in value since November 2016 and doubled since the start of last year. At the federal government's current rate of spending, all that gold would be enough to cover less than three months' worth of federal deficits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Which may help explain why gold is at $4,000 an ounce in the first place. The last time the federal government actually balanced its books, in 2000, gold changed hands at less than $300 an ounce. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read next: Why I'm buying more gold </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Taneja was an early investor in companies including Stripe, Snap (SNAP), Grammarly and Anduril, with a focus on applied AI, healthcare transformation and responsible innovation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His new book, \"The Transformation Principles: How to Create Enduring Change\" (co-authored with Kevin Maney), outlines nine principles for companies and managers to create sustainable change. Under Taneja's leadership, General Catalyst has raised billions of dollars while emphasizing ethical AI deployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In this recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Taneja discusses how individuals and companies can transform themselves, notes AI stocks with growth potential, and explains AI's huge risk and major opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What's the central message of your new book, and why is it timely now? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: We are entering a technology cycle where AI is going to be a transformative force, and it's going to transform many industries. There is an opportunity to actually make capitalism work for everybody if we make the right intentional choices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What does a company need to do to have a successful transformation through AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: For an organization to be transformative, it needs to have a culture of curiosity and generosity. They need to transform, but not disrupt. Disruption is the alternative to transformation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Should an individual begin transforming themselves today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: You have to. Steve Jobs said that first we have to change ourselves, then we change our industry, and then we change the world. We have to transform ourselves to deliver greater value and then gain the ability to transform the industries that we work in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Is AI going to be more transformative than the internet? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: It will be bigger. When the internet came, it was all about making things more efficient, but humans were still doing the work and software was making them more efficient. With AI, you're basically saying it will do the same job as a human for the most part. When ChatGPT first arrived, every CEO in every industry and in every country was thinking about what to do with it. It was the first time a technology hit the zeitgeist across the entire world at the same time (i.e., it became a global cultural phenomenon). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Many employees fear that AI means job loss. How can leaders introduce it in a way that builds trust and gets people on board? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: Change is scary for a lot of people, which is why trust matters. If AI people came into your company and said to your employees, \"We are going to transform your business,\" the natural response is that you're going to kill their jobs. That's because you didn't take the time to build trust. Instead, tell them, \"We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.\" They would embrace it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Which companies are getting AI adoption right today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: In my book I talked about companies such as Applied Intuition, Hippocratic AI, Stripe and Commure. Some of the AI model companies are obviously doing very well. If you look at the consensus, it would be OpenAI and Anthropic. There are also open-source companies, such as Mistral, that are building AI models that are quite interesting. There are also companies that are imagining modern call centers, the evolution of the legal department, how accounting is being done with AI, how marketing and sales are going to be done using AI, and how to empower sales reps. Those types of companies are going to be very, very interesting over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest risks of AI adoption? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja:  We are going to transition from a culture of solving problems to a culture of asking questions, which will be a big transition. We want to make sure we're not losing our cognitive capabilities, our ability to think, and our ability to solve problems. How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? There is a trap you can fall into, whereas these technologies get better and better, and you stop thinking. Think about how to get from point A to point B today. People turn on the map program and lose all touch of how things are laid out physically. You don't want that to happen to all concepts in your brain. It is a downside if we become too reliant and give up sharpening our own cognitive skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What are the key steps leaders must take to successfully integrate AI into their organizations? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There are four steps leaders must take to make AI work: First, they have to change their data infrastructure and their IT (information technology) department so they can adopt AI. Then they must train them with the data. Next, they have to change their workforce because they now have humans and AI working together. What a lot of CEOs got wrong is they didn't realize that the only way a profound change will happen in their company is if they demonstrate courage and conviction. They have to encourage their people to take risks and show them how it will make them more successful. Otherwise, people get scared, and they won't use it. That's how a lot of organizations get stuck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What is the biggest cautionary lesson leaders should keep in mind as they adopt AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There will always be those who use AI for societal harm. We have to trust the system to build the right guardrails. Over time, this technology will be properly regulated in terms of who gets access to it and how it gets applied. Like any new technology, it could be bumpy. I have an optimistic view that human beings will find a way to leverage these profound technologies for good in the aggregate, such as what happened with nuclear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: With AI reshaping so many industries, how can employees protect their careers and make sure they thrive in an AI-driven workplace? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: The most concrete and useful advice I can give is to learn how to adopt AI to do your job more effectively. That's really what you should be doing. This means asking the right questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and being more strategic in your own work. It's a huge opportunity for employees. In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What guidance would you give recent graduates entering today's fast-changing job market? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: To understand that the world is going to change a lot in the next few years. When kids used to graduate 10 years ago, they would list all the software they knew how to use on their resume. Now we're in a world where that software is changing every three months, and you're constantly having to learn and keep up to be effective at your job. Being a lifelong learner is important. The world is an empty canvas. Let's have AI shape the world to be what we want it to be. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Looking ahead, how do you see AI reshaping society and business in the years to come? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: AI is a transformative force, and we have an amazing opportunity in front of us to transform society, to transform nations, to transform industries, and to transform our own business with AI with this mindset of abundance, of building companies that are truly focused on purpose and profit. We need to find the ingredients required to be able to build companies that can be agents of such transformations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Sincere is the author of several books, including \"Understanding Stocks,\" \"Understanding Options,\" and \"Help Your Child Build Wealth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: The AI boom is over - here's your bubble survival guide </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Michael Sincere </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The government shut down, which is barreling towards a record, has forced federal workers to miss paychecks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The government shutdown is poised to mark a major milestone next week in the absence of a deal, as the partial closure heads towards the longest on record. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From workers skipping paychecks to missing economic data causing the Federal Reserve to fly partially blind in its decision making, the effects of the shutdown are being increasingly felt throughout the U.S. economy. And as of Saturday morning, there's no end in sight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The pressure is only likely to grow. Food-stamp benefits were scheduled to expire Saturday, yet on Friday afternoon, federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay them. Meanwhile,  millions of Americans who buy plans under the Affordable Care Act may start enrolling in their health insurance Saturday. But without the subsidies at the heart of the shutdown battle, many are in for sticker shock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown would become the country's most prolonged on Tuesday night, eclipsing the 35-day shutdown that stretched from December 2018 to January 2019. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's a closer look at some of the key issues around the shutdown, and what could force its end. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The coming air travel 'disaster' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Holiday air travel is rapidly approaching, and with Thanksgiving flights in sight, some see a \"disaster\" in the making if the shutdown doesn't end. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That was the word choice of Vice President JD Vance, who met on Thursday with U.S. airline executives. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Invoking the paychecks missed by federal workers like air-traffic controllers, Vance said: \"How many of them are not going to show up for work?\" after missing multiple checks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Airlines themselves chimed in, with United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL) and Delta Airlines Inc. (DAL) urging lawmakers to end the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read on: Air-traffic controllers miss their first paycheck. The shutdown's effects on airports are getting worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Food-stamp stress </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Funding for Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, was set to lapse Saturday before the judges' order to tap emergency accounts to pay for them. Around 40 million people receive food stamps, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and without the aid, Americans would need to turn to programs like community food pantries. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The judges gave the White House leeway on whether to fund SNAP partially or in full for November, according to the Associated Press. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a social-media post late Friday, President Donald Trump suggested the government would comply with the rulings, but said more clarity was needed from the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,\" he said in a post on Truth Social. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not just consumers and families that would be affected by an interruption in SNAP benefits. There's a potential hit to the U.S. economy as well, in the form of depleted spending. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The $8 billion paid in monthly SNAP benefits represents around 10% of retail grocery sales, though the impact won't be limited to groceries as households are more likely to substitute away from other retail categories to find cash to allocate to food spending,\" said analysts at RBC Economics in a note on Thursday. \"This represents a sizable risk that retail sales and broader consumption will slow in Q4 as a result.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Department of Agriculture said ahead of the shutdown it would pay the SNAP benefits using emergency funding, then later said such funding wasn't \"legally available.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now read: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Obamacare could force action </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The threat of sharply rising health insurance premiums may serve to end the shutdown, though to date the parties remain far apart. The end of subsidies for plans bought under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will become more apparent as open enrollment begins for those plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Higher premiums won't kick in until after Dec. 31. Americans also have already been getting letters from their insurers revealing their higher rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But some see Obamacare as forcing a deal, along with the expiration of SNAP benefits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Given the Nov. 1 action-forcing catalysts of SNAP benefit delays &amp; ACA Open Enrollment, we believe resolution on the shutdown is likely by Nov. 14,\" said Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, in a note on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He predicted a one-year Obamacare subsidy extension is likely and added that reforms could be made for the following year for involving things like income caps. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Banks like Chase, Capital One are offering financial help to customers affected by the shutdown. Here are the potential downsides. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Election aftermath </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown's length milestone and Election Day could collide on Tuesday, thrusting the federal closure into the spotlight anew and perhaps provoking a fresh push to end it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Voters in New Jersey and Virginia will choose governors, in some of the more closely watched races. Wins by Democrats could give them \"an opportunity to claim victory by proclaiming that support for their healthcare messaging and shutdown tactics helped fuel the party's victories at the ballot box,\" Christopher Niebuhr of Beacon Policy Advisors recently wrote. That would \"cushion the blow of folding in the government shutdown fight.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But it's \"also possible that resounding victories in the November 4th elections and the launch of the ACA's open-enrollment period will only strengthen the party's resolve,\" said Niebuhr. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Victor Reklaitis contributed . </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Robert Schroeder </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

I went over the options with the major financial group holding the IRA. I made a choice based on the information given, but I admit published IRA rules and the Secure Act 2.0 left me confused about which was the best choice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative told me that I would be able to change my choice if I was not satisfied. After mulling things over, I felt I wanted to change my choice but when I called back I was told by another representative presumably higher up the food chain that this was not so. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given that all conversations were on a recorded line, I requested a copy of the pertinent conversations regarding this matter. I was told they did not provide copies of these conversations. Is this another thing in life we need to get a lawyer for? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your thoughts please. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bamboozled Beneficiary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: I'm in my 70s. Should I take the tax hit and withdraw all of my inherited IRA to avoid required minimum distributions? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Bamboozled, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As if a personal loss leading to an inherited account wasn't enough, financial headaches make the situation all the more stressful. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're right in that inherited account options, as well as many other retirement plan decisions, are complicated, and the published rules or changes under any new law do not always make them easier to understand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, let's review the options for a spouse who inherits an IRA. The two main avenues are rolling the money over into an IRA in the inheritor's own name or transferring the assets to an inherited IRA, though someone could also either take a lump-sum distribution or disclaim the assets if they so wished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spouses get to do the option to roll over the money into an IRA under their own name. They can use a new or existing IRA. This option can be quite tax-advantageous, especially if you don't need the money anytime soon and are not close to the current RMD age, which is 73 years old. For instance, if your spouse had already reached 73 but you haven't, you don't have to take those required minimum distributions even if your spouse had taken them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about retirement, Social Security, where to live or how to afford it at all? We want to hear from you. Join the conversation in our Facebook community: Retire Better with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are caveats, however. If your wife was taking RMDs before but hadn't in the year of her death, you would have to do so now. \"This RMD is calculated based on the longer of the remaining life expectancy or your spouse's single-life expectancy,\" according to Fidelity Investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another caveat: If you're under 59 1/2 years old and you do end up needing to draw down some of that money, you'd be hit with a 10% penalty if the money is in an account under your name before you reach that age for penalty-free distributions. However, you could convert the money to a Roth account after rolling it into an account under your name. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The second avenue is to transfer the money into an inherited IRA, which would avoid that 10% penalty for distributions for those under 59 1/2 years old. With this option, you either can begin RMDs in the year after the year of death or you can wait until the year in which your wife would have turned 73. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The starting date depends on whether your wife was of RMD age. If she was taking her RMDs, you would have to take the RMD for the year if she hadn't done so yet, and then you can begin taking RMDs based on your life expectancy in the year after the year of her death, and thereafter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If your wife had not yet reached her RMD age, then you can either take the RMD by Dec. 31 of the year after the year of death or, if later, by the end of the year that your wife would have reached her RMD age. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can always decide to go from an inherited spouse IRA to your own IRA down the road,\" Stephen Maggard, a certified financial planner at Abacus Planning Group. The reverse, however, is not possible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lawyering up </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Getting attorneys involved can bring along its own stresses, as well as costs, so you should only do so if you're sure that you have suffered financial damage and you believe you could get something out of the whole process. Before doing so, try sending the firm a written request for the recorded call. Alternatively, an attorney might be able to get a hold of that recorded call with a subpoena. However, many businesses do not provide copies of recorded conversations unless they receive a subpoena, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to HG.org, an online legal resource. \"A subpoena is a request for certain documents to be produced, usually made by an attorney who is representing a client in a pending case who believes that the information requested will prove or disprove a component of the case.\" If a business fails to comply when it does not have a defense, it adds, the party can be subject to civil or criminal penalties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide not to use an attorney, but you still want to try and get a hold of that recording, you can file a complaint with regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or your state regulator.
