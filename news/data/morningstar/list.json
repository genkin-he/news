Other major events were the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision in 2014 to keep oil (CL.1) (BRN00) output steady despite worries about a global supply glut. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disruptions also swept up U.S. crude and oil-product supply when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017, while the Trump administration's previous \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran, including rounds of new sanctions, led to a rally in oil prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the new conflict, there's still a \"very cloudy outlook\" in terms of what level of retaliation Iran may pursue and what that may mean for global supply and demand balances, said De Haan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Iran conflict raises talk of a return to $100-a-barrel oil </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans will be very anxious about what the conflict could mean for oil prices, given how President Trump made low oil prices his \"signature policy,\" he said. This certainly has potential to \"offset lower energy prices for some time, and motorists are going to feel a \"bit more a pinch\" in prices, which typically already happens in the springtime as demand and prices edge higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $2.957 early evening on Saturday, according to GasBuddy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prices were already seeing a \"slow, steady uptick\" with spring break travel right around the corner, said De Haan, and as temperatures warm up, fuel demand increases from now to mid- to late-July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The attacks on Iran will exacerbate that increase, he said, though it's not likely to be on the level of the \"superspike\" seen in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when retail gas prices briefly topped $5 in June of that year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The national average could climb between 25 cents to 50 cents a gallon between now and April or May to the mid-$3 range, said De Haan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And if things go \"bad at every turn,\" he said, consumers could potentially see prices rising by even more than 50 cents a gallon. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.

Andreas shared the authentic TU1260MS footage captured live on site during IWA and also the pre-release testing footages of new products, providing undeniable proof of the ApexVision advantage. Attendees witnessed the innovation's ability to maintain optimal detail, clearly highlight targets from the background, and high dynamic range in demanding, pitch-black scenarios. Andreas's real-world clips showcased the ApexCore S1 detector's ultra-high sensitivity of NETD＜15mK, demonstrating how the technology preserves contrast and edge clarity.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Professionals and enthusiasts were particularly struck by the \"see-it-to-believe-it\" clarity of the ApexVision technology on our flagship of TU1260MS.
