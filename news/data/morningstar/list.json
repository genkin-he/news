But some argue that the real story is a bit more complicated than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One big question in the wake of Block's (XYZ) job-cuts announcement is whether AI really is the cause of such widespread reductions in head count. For instance, Block's employee count swelled in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, going from under 4,000 at the end of 2019 to a recent figure over 10,000. The company, which houses Square and Cash App, will pare its workforce to below 6,000 employees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"How much of this is using AI as a justification to unwind over-hiringduring the COVID-era?\" Deutsche Bank analyst Nate Svensson asked in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The debate became so pronounced on X that Block CEO Jack Dorsey responded to one online critic who slammed his \"managerial incompetence.\" Dorsey argued that he was wrong to hire too many people who ended up serving in redundant roles, but he also said he already \"corrected\" those mistakes more than a year ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dorsey also argued that Block is already being run efficiently. The company has been trying to get more serious about profitability for several years, including streamlining organizational structures and focusing more on respected financial metrics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CFO Amrita Ahuja told MarketWatch on Thursday that Block's management thinks the decision would enable it to serve customers better and with a greater emphasis on product velocity. \"We would not do this\" if it weren't for the company's customer focus, she said. \"If we're delivering for customers, we're also delivering for shareholders.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Why did AI 'science fiction' spur market panic? We asked a behavioral-finance expert to find out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat acknowledged the various puts and takes of Block's \"audacious\" move. On one hand, \"someone can argue that Block is not exactly a poster child of an efficiently run company,\" noting \"duplicate cost functions across Block\" on a historical basis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Rawat didn't exactly get into these matter, the company has also made polarizing acquisitions and drawn criticism for other elements of its spending. For one, Block acquired buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay in an all-stock deal valued at $29 billion that closed in 2022, but now Block itself is only worth $33 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Last year, the company's third-quarter \"in-person company event\" for employees was so costly that the company had to disclose it as one of the reasons behind a $68 million increase in general and administrative expenses for that period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But for all the criticism of Block's inefficiencies, the \"head count actions cannot be explained by 'bloat'\" as \"that problem was somewhat solved from 2023-2025,\" Rawat added. After some adjustments, Block's gross profit per employee was $800,000 at the end of 2025, she said, above what peers like PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Adyen (NL:ADYEN) showed. The company's guidance implies that the ratio could work out to $1.5 million in 2026, \"exceeding the levels seen at large tech giants.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elsewhere, analysts saw merit in the AI explanation. \"Block is a tech-forward company that has invested meaningfully in internal AI tools, which is allowing them to take such a drastic action,\" Matthew Coad of Truist Securities said in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Additional investors are expected to join the fundraising round down the road, OpenAI said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The new valuation marks a dramatic increase from the $500 billion that OpenAI was valued at about four months ago. And less than a year ago, in March 2025, OpenAI was worth $300 billion, less than half its current valuation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The important thing now will be for OpenAI to improve monetization. The company disclosed in January that it had more than $20 billion in annual recurring revenue during 2025, up from $6 billion in 2024. But the latest performance pales in comparison to similarly sized public peers. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), with an $802 billion market capitalization, had $182 billion in revenue in 2025, while Exxon Mobil (XOM), which is valued at $614 billion, had $324 billion in annual sales, without including items like income from equity affiliates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More than 9 million business customers now pay to use ChatGPT, while more than 50 million consumers have enrolled in a subscription plan, according to OpenAI. The company said some 900 million consumers actively use ChatGPT each week. Codex, a coding agent, has 1.6 million weekly users, according to OpenAI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,\" OpenAI said in a statement. \"Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     OpenAI said it would expand its relationship with Nvidia to include using 3 gigawatts \"of dedicated inference capacity and 2 GW of training on Vera Rubin systems.\" This will help the company train and deploy AI models and thus attract more business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fundraise also deepens Amazon's relationship with OpenAI, which in November committed $38 billion to gain access to Amazon Web Services' infrastructure. The companies said Friday they would extend that deal by $100 billion over an eight-year period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AWS will also become the exclusive third-party cloud distributer for OpenAI Frontier, an enterprise platform, while OpenAI will help develop custom models for Amazon. Only $15 billion of Amazon's announced investment will be provided immediately. The rest will be invested once \"certain conditions\" are met, according to the release. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Why Nvidia is 'highly motivated' to keep investing in OpenAI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     OpenAI seemingly expected investors to be concerned that its deal with Amazon hinted at tensions with Microsoft (MSFT), which has been a major partner. The companies published a lengthy joint statement on Friday reiterating that their relationship \"remains unchanged.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Collaborations like the partnership between OpenAI and Amazon were always contemplated under our agreements and Microsoft is excited to see what they build together,\" the companies said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: OpenAI reportedly eyeing an IPO by year's end, ahead of Anthropic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The chatbot race remains heated. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) said recently that its Gemini chatbot had surpassed 750 million monthly active users. Elon Musk's xAI said in January that it reaches 600 monthly active users with its Grok, while Meta Platforms (META) has 1 billion monthly active users for Meta AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     OpenAI's fundraise comes just a few weeks after rival artificial-intelligence lab Anthropic announced a $380 billion post-money valuation after raising $30 billion from investors, including Microsoft and Nvidia. In January, xAI said it raised $20 billion from investors. It was recently officially acquired by SpaceX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     OpenAI, Anthropic and SpaceX are each reportedly considering plans for a public listing that could come as soon as this year.
