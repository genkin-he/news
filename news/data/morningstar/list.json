He added that the Department of Defense and other U.S. agencies have six months to phase out Anthropic's technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. On Thursday, Anthropic said it would work to enable a \"smooth transition\" to another provider. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's announcement comes after days of public and private back-and-forth negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic that occasionally turned ugly. After Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei defended his company's refusal to budge on Thursday, a Pentagon official accused him of trying to \"personally control the U.S. military.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex,\" the official, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Emil Michael, wrote on X. Michael, a former executive at Uber Technologies (UBER), also accused Anthropic of having a plan to \"impose\" its values on Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conflict stems from Anthropic's contract with the Defense Department, which is worth up to $200 million. Anthropic has drawn a line in the sand over how the agency can use its technology. Specifically, Anthropic doesn't want its products to be used to develop autonomous weapons or for mass surveillance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon has said it has \"no interest\" in using AI for those purposes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,\" Amodei wrote Thursday. \"Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today's technology can safely and reliably do.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But that didn't square with a Jan. 9 memo handed down by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that calls for AI labs to amend their defense contracts to allow \"any lawful use\" of their technology. Hegseth gave the department 180 days to insert that standard into any contract that involves procuring AI services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"DoD does not want a private company's usage policy to function as a veto over lawful military applications,\" Jessica Tillipman, a professor at George Washington University's law school who specializes in government procurement law, told MarketWatch over email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If DoD makes this the default clause across all AI vendors, it eliminates vendor-by-vendor negotiation over acceptable use and signals that firms unwilling to accept that baseline will be replaced,\" Tillipman said. \"It sounds like boring contract boilerplate, but it is really about procurement leverage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this week, the Pentagon had given Anthropic a Friday deadline to agree to its terms. A spokesperson for the Defense Department said the agency had no further comment on the matter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hegseth had earlier threatened to declare Anthropic a \"supply-chain risk\" and force the company to agree to its terms using a Korean War-era law if it didn't capitulate ahead of the Friday deadline. It's unclear whether Anthropic could still be labeled a supply-chain risk, a designation previously applied only to foreign companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before this week, Claude was the only AI model approved for classified use in the Pentagon. Claude was even used, through a Palantir Technologies (PLTR) partnership, to help the U.S. capture Venezuela's then president, Nicolás Maduro, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Elon Musk's xAI signed a deal to allow its controversial Grok model to be used for classified purposes earlier this week. Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns over potential safety issues with Grok, the Journal reports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A senior Pentagon official told MarketWatch that other companies are close to a similar agreement that would allow their AI models to be used for classified work. OpenAI and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have made versions of their AI models, ChatGPT and Gemini, available on the Defense Department's GenAI.mil enterprise platform used by civilian and military personnel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Representatives for Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this month, Anthropic said it had raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation and disclosed $14 billion in annual run-rate revenue, driven mostly by increasing enterprise adoption of products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Amazon, Nvidia and SoftBank pour $110 billion into OpenAI - raising the stakes for AI monetization </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, an exchange-traded fund that tracks software stocks, closed down roughly 1%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns have been brewing among investors that AI could do away with the need for workers across sectors, from insurance to wealth management to real estate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors not only worry that AI efficiencies will drive companies to cut costs and head counts; they also fear that fewer employees will directly translate to shrinking demand for traditional software licenses. Many business-software companies sell their products based on customer head count, or on a per-seat basis, and investors are looking carefully at whether software companies will be hit by a decline in these subscriptions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So when Block (XYZ) announced on Thursday that it is cutting more than 40% of its employees, some analysts interpreted the news as a prequel to a future where AI will replace the workforce. And those fears hit software stocks that were trying to recover after weeks of negative sentiment driven by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Block job cuts are the latest blow to investor confidence in the software sector's ability to withstand the ongoing threat that AI will dramatically shift the future of work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Monday, software stocks lost over $200 billion in market capitalization after Citrini Research released a blog post depicting a hypothetical future where AI leads to mass layoffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Did a blog post just cause software stocks to lose more than $200 billion in market cap? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Truist Securities analyst Matthew Coad said in a note that Block may be a   \"case study\" for how companies' investments in AI could \"adversely impact employment rates.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     J.P. Morgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a note that a new \"world of work\" is \"impending,\" and that Block is \"proactively restructuring\" the company to adapt to that reality. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: The stock market is reflecting fears of an AI apocalypse for white-collar jobs </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat said in a note that she wonders if Block's move could lend credence to the \"unemployment fears\" that have \"gripped markets\" recently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Block may create a playbook for others,\" she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some of the biggest software-sector declines on Friday seemed largely unrelated to the AI hysteria around Block's layoffs. Shares of Zscaler (ZS) and Elastic NV (ESTC) lost 12% and 15%, respectively, on Friday, while PAR Technology's stock (PAR) ended the day down 27%. All three companies reported earnings on Thursday afternoon that were poorly received by the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite all the drama, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF eked out a 1% gain for the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Friday note to clients that he expects the software space to see a \"major comeback\" in the coming months, as investors will recognize that the \"disconnected doomsday software trade\" is \"mispriced.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Hannah Pedone </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The outlook assigned to the FSR is stable, while the outlook assigned to the Long-Term ICR is positive. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” (Good) of Redbridge Insurance Company Limited (RICL) (St. James, Barbados). The outlook of the FSR is stable, while the outlook of the Long-Term ICR is positive.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Credit Ratings (ratings) assigned to RIC reflect its reinsurance agreement with RICL. These ratings also reflect RICL’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe positive outlook of RICL’s Long-Term ICR reflects AM Best’s expectation that RICL will be able to maintain its sound business strategy of consistent global expansion, driven by geographic, product, and distribution channel diversification, while at the same time sustaining its favorable trend in operating performance. The positive Long-Term ICR outlooks also reflect expectations of a reinforced capital position supportive of an assessed risk-adjusted capitalization level of strongest, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRICL is an insurance and reinsurance company founded in December 2010, and is part of Redbridge Holding, LLC (Redbridge Holding), a company specialized in the management of insurance and reinsurance. Most members of RICL’s management team have worked together for many years in developing and expanding the company; consequently, the company has achieved significant growth in recent years. Companies incorporated into RICL’s organizational structure in more-recent years continue to provide services primarily to RICL, bolstering management’s commitment to expanding RICL. RIC plays a key role in facilitating the group’s stated strategy to operate directly in Puerto Rico with travelers’ insurance. Parental support is reflected in a 95% quota-share agreement. RICL’s main line of business is health insurance, with a complete network of operations that has enabled growth mainly in the Latin America and Caribbean markets. As of December 2024, health insurance constituted 52.6% of RICL’s portfolio, followed by property/casualty insurance with 31%, travel insurance with 6.9%, and the remaining in liabilities and life. The company is diversified geographically among 128 countries, with a focus in Latin America, and its largest concentration in Mexico (14.3%).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRICL’s balance sheet was reinforced through a USD 7 million capital infusion in 2025; nonetheless, it is still subject to volatility derived from the company’s net business portfolio distribution and growth, as well as from pressures stemming from changes in its asset structure and cession profile.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRICL’s loss ratio remains contained, driven by consistent improvements in its underwriting portfolio management. Moreover, after the incorporation of the new entities into the organization, the company’s cost-revenue structure shifted, increasing profitability. The company has maintained its retention, with an underwriting portfolio reflecting the business expansion initiatives. As of year-end 2024, RICL reflected sound underwriting and profitability metrics characterized by a 91.3% combined ratio, and a return-on-equity ratio of 32.6%. RICL continued to reflect profitable bottom-line results through October 2025, with a combined ratio within its five-year average, according to preliminary financial results.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPositive ratings actions could take place if the RICL sustains its favorable business strategy while generating a sound underwriting performance, in conjunction with a reinforced capital base that supports the strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization. Negative rating actions could occur if underwriting results deteriorate and erode the company's capital base and reduce risk-adjusted capitalization to a level that no longer supports the ratings. Negative rating actions could also occur if financial leverage at RICL's holding company deteriorates.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.
