In the third quarter of last year, the company reported revenue of C$14.2 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In its U.S. refining segment, crude throughput came to 605,300 barrels a day. Upstream production reached 832,900 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from 771,300 a day a year ago, of which about 642,800 a day were from the oil sand segment. Analysts were expecting total production of about 830,500 barrels a day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Cenovus Energy recently reached a deal to acquire MEG Energy in a strategic move to expand its oil sands portfolio. The agreement included the divestiture of certain assets to Strathcona Resources, which was also in the running to acquire MEG. This proposed transaction, which will finally be voted on by MEG shareholders on Nov. 7, aims to consolidate Cenovus's position in thermal oil production in the competitive landscape of Canadian oil patch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  For the full year, Cenovus lowered its output guidance to reflect the disposal of its 50% stake in WRB Refining LP, a joint venture with Phillips 66. It now expects downstream throughput of 510,000 barrels a day to 515,000 barrels a day, which represents a decrease of 52,500 barrels a day at the midpoint. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Downstream turnaround expenses are now pegged at of $360 million to $380 million, lowered by $65 million at the midpoint. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 06:52 ET (10:52 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account. I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I have a considerable amount of unrealized capital gains in this fund and can't decide whether selling some or all of it and paying the taxes makes sense, or if I should wait through the coming decline. I am 78 and retired. My wife and I have an income of $200,000 due to IRA withdrawals.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A word of caution for him and everyone else: If you have $100,000 or $1 million in your tech-heavy mutual fund, you are sitting pretty. It will receive a step-up in basis as an inheritance. With IRA withdrawals and Social Security, this man is enjoying some well-earned gravy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors should not make decisions about their portfolio based on a feared downturn in the S&amp;P 500 SPX. You will see arguments for and against whether there is a big correction ahead. Instead, adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All that tech money won't do you much good sitting in your bank account. Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make the December quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity, the \"seven-year rule\" states that you should only invest money in the market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

aircraft under President Trump's Golden Dome project, people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The funding was included in the tax-and-spending bill that Trump signed in July, but wasn't publicly linked to a contractor. The planned \"air moving target indicator\" system could eventually field as many as 600 satellites, some of the people said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Samsung Electronics, Nvidia to Build AI Factory in New Chip Deal </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia has struck a spate of deals with some of South Korea's biggest companies that will see more than a quarter-million of its chips deployed across the country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The tie-ups with Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor Group and other Korean industrial giants were announced Friday as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited South Korea to attend a summit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Audi Cuts Profitability Guidance Again </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Audi cut its full-year margin guidance again as U.S. tariffs, restructuring costs and the postponement of an electric-vehicle platform weigh on profitability at the German automaker. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We are responding to the challenging overall economic situation and intensified competition with stringent cost control measures and are continuing to work on our financial performance,\" Audi Chief Financial Officer Juergen Rittersberger said. \"At the same time, we are making our business model future-proof and resilient.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     French Inflation Eases After ECB Holds Rates </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     French inflation cooled a little in October despite an unexpectedly strong upswing in the economy, likely helping keep European Central Bank policymakers on course to hold interest rates well into next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumer prices were 0.9% higher than the same month of last year, down from 1.1% in September, EU-harmonized figures published by statistics agency Insee showed Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More Home Purchases Are Falling Through in an Uncertain Economy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trish DaCosta saved for more than five years to buy a home in Nashville, Tenn., and was thrilled when her offer on a roughly $400,000, three-bedroom house was accepted. Then, a month before closing earlier this year, she was laid off from her job in public relations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When she learned she lost her job, the first call she made was to her real-estate agent to pull the offer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wall Street Is Punishing Stocks When Earnings Fail to Sparkle </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market isn't far from all-time highs and many experts would argue that stocks are priced for perfection. That is a problem because top companies like Meta Platforms and Chipotle are reporting earnings and issuing outlooks that are a little less than perfect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chipotle illustrates what is happening. The popular Mexican food chain's results, released late Wednesday, weren't bad per se: Earnings and revenue matched Wall Street's forecasts. But the company said same-store sales for the fourth quarter are now likely to decline, a sign of slowing demand that Wall Street wasn't expecting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump Pivots Second Term Toward Foreign Policy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BUSAN, South Korea-President Trump wrapped up his six-day swing through Asia by touting trade deals and new investments in the U.S. But as he arrives back in Washington, the gold-plated receptions abroad are giving way to a shuttered government and deepening voter anxiety about the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The split screen sheds light on why Trump has turned much of his second-term attention to foreign policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's Vow to Resume Nuclear Tests Leaves Experts Puzzled </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     WASHINGTON-A day after President Trump vowed to resume testing of nuclear weapons, the White House wasn't answering questions about the details, leaving members of Congress, experts and even the administration's nominee to command U.S. nuclear forces uncertain what he meant. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I don't have insights into the president's intent,\" Vice Adm.

Exxon and Chevron are slated to report earnings on Friday, after a string of upbeat quarters for the two integrated giants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are slated to report quarterly earnings before the bell Friday. They've posted better profits and revenues in the past several quarters, but today's financial snapshots could be different. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron (CVX) has beaten per-share profit estimates for the past two quarters. Exxon (XOM) has done the same for the past five quarters. Both of them beat on revenue in the last quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But earnings are likely to be weaker this time around, given commodities prices, Morningstar analyst Allen Good said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. oil futures prices (CL.1) are down nearly 3% so far this month, and have fallen nearly 16% year to date. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's because of a slowdown in demand amid concerns about further economic pain, which would lessen the need for oil, and rising production quotas from the world's top oil-producing countries since this spring. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are plenty of worries that oil prices may be headed to their lowest since the pandemic. A World Bank report this week pointed to an oil supply glut brewing for next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts polled by FactSet expect Chevron to report adjusted earnings of $1.71 a share on sales of $47.3 billion. That would compare with third-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.51 on sales of $50.7 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For Exxon, the analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.82 on sales of $86.5 billion. That would be down from the year-ago results of $1.92 in adjusted EPS on sales of $90 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The integrated giants are not the same companies they were a decade ago, with management that is more disciplined and shying away from boom-and-bust cycles, Allen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They have improved their balance sheet and shown capital discipline,\" he said. \"They are still showing relatively strong returns and balance sheets, and they are not overextended.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Their stock trajectories this year seem to support that distinction. Exxon shares are holding on to a 7% gain so far in 2025, while Chevron shares are flat. However, they have underperformed the broader equity market, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX gaining about 16% so far this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
