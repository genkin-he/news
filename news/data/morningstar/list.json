            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Kenneth Rapoza </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. and China reach a truce, but America's national security depends on its self-sufficiency </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neodymium stone, part of the rare earth group, is the world's strongest magnetic ore. U.S. rare-earths companies need to decouple from dependence on China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump's whirlwind Asia tour was a headwind for critical U.S.-based rare-earths miners, including MP Materials (MP), USA Rare Earth (USAR) and Energy Fuels (UUUU). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bull case for these companies remains now that the dust is settling. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to postpone export controls on rare earths at their meeting in South Korea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the push for U.S. rare-earths companies to decouple from dependence on China still matters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The main concern I had about these companies during Trump's Asia visit was that the president was focusing on the short-term supply of critical minerals - of which rare earths are a part. Rare-earth elements are mostly used to make high-powered magnets - those needed to manufacture a gyroscope for a fighter jet, for example. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China owns this supply chain and has consistently threatened to withhold supply. Critical mineral pacts with Australia, Malaysia and Thailand are a short-term solution, and  signaled to investors that these are the countries to invest in - not the U.S.  Energy Fuels, for example, imports materials from these producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the U.S.-Australia critical-minerals framework, for example, the Export-Import Bank of the United States issued seven Letters of Interest totaling more than $2.2 billion to Australian-owned projects, including Arafura Rare Earths (AU:ARU), Northern Minerals (AU:NTU), Graphex Group (GRFXY) and others. Those mined goods will be exported to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's deal with Japan, in contrast, is an \"America First\" arrangement that provides funding for U.S. mining operations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Japanese are investing in U.S. smelting of copper, a critical mineral, and a lithium-ion-phosphate processing plant. Much of this investment will support critical mineral supply chains and energy infrastructure. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When you are facing a behemoth nonmarket economy like China that is mostly only interested in full employment, you don't have a lot of options </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump is thinking in the short term with these recent deals in order to get supply into the U.S. and avoid China. The Trump administration is also thinking in the long term, with local miners in mind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Remember, there is an ongoing Section 232 tariff investigation into critical minerals. Miners are convinced this will lead to tariffs that protect industry investment. The market should not be too spooked by that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently announced that the government would create a strategic minerals reserve, not just for defense, but for national economic security - something the private sector can dip into. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The administration also implemented price floors. If China decides to overproduce a commodity to collapse prices globally and destroy margins of American miners, the U.S. government will make up the difference. Bessent said the goal is to build a deep, domestic critical-minerals industry. He said the tactic was \"the equivalent of Operation Warp Speed\" in the COVID-19 vaccine era. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some argue this all sounds like Chinese-style industrial policy. The problem is, when you are facing a behemoth nonmarket economy like China that is mostly only interested in full employment, you don't have a lot of options to compete.  You are never going to beat China on price or labor. China has surpassed every other market economy to become No. 2. The U.S. is the last man standing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump remade the narrative on China starting in 2017. There is now a rethinking occurring among American corporations about the so-called Asia pivot. Supply chains are getting closer to home. Others are actually coming home. This holds true for mined goods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Demand in the U.S. seems apparent. Apple (AAPL) partnered with MP Materials in July to expand domestic magnet manufacturing. GM (GM) did the same with MP in 2021 and this year entered into a joint venture with Lithium Americas' (LAC) Thacker Pass mine in Nevada to gain access to the lithium it will use in EV batteries. USA Rare Earth signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with PolarStar Innovations for neodymium magnets in May. And Energy Fuels signed an MOU with POSCO Holdings (KR:005490) of South Korea in March. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration is not Asia-focused, even if Trump's visit there makes it look that way. The administration is doing what has to be done to give U.S. miners and their investors long-term certainty. This includes the government taking an equity stake in MP Materials, price floors and rolling out grants and loans in an effort to create some level of certainty. There's more than enough money for that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Kenneth Rapoza is an analyst for the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which represents U.S. producers and workers. He is a former journalist who has reported from Brazil and covered the BRIC economies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's how to lower your risk when selecting rare-earth stocks to buy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Plus: Space is the next frontier for the U.S. and China to fight over.

This week also marks the first missed paycheck for the nation's air-traffic controllers, while Transportation Security Administration employees, including airport screeners, are also going without pay. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That increases the risk of further flight cancellations mere weeks away from the air-travel Super Bowl: Thanksgiving week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If we are still going [with the shutdown] by Thanksgiving, it'll be a disaster in the air\" in terms of delays, said Ernest Arvai, president of AirInsight Group, who noted that Thanksgiving also usually brings weather delays on top of the crowds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Roughly 14,000 air-traffic controllers and some 60,000 TSA agents are considered essential workers, and are thus expected to continue working during the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They may increasingly be calling out of work, however. \"Staffing triggers,\" indicating a shortage of controllers, drove some flight cancellations and delays in recent days, in addition to the more usual halts triggered by bad weather or construction at major airports this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Staffing triggers are expected to increase throughout the rest of the week as paychecks remain held up, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, on its website, urges air-traffic controllers to \"rise to the occasion.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our union or our professions,\" the Union said on its webpage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AirInsight's Arvai said air-traffic controllers have done a great public service during the shutdown. \"But all it takes is a couple of guys being out\" for delays, as the system is already operating under long-running shortages, he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It takes three to five years of experience for an air-traffic controller to work in high-density areas. Only about a third of the people vying to become a controller complete training, and of those, \"the stress gets to about half\" in their first few months on the job, Arvai said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"To get one controller, you probably have had to train five. It's not a job for everybody, let me put it that way,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In several interviews this week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned of even more air-travel disruption as the shutdown grinds on. Duffy said at an event that \"this year, on average, the delays that are associated with staffing triggers, with air-traffic controllers, is 5%,\" but that they were 44% on Sunday and 24% on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So far in 2025, which is considered a normal year, around 20% of flights have been delayed for a variety of reasons, aviation analytics company Cirium said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Major travel groups have yet to issue their predictions for Thanksgiving-week travel, which broke records last year. Travel and leisure group AAA said last year that nearly 6 million people were expected to fly during the holiday week, or 2% more than the previous year. Executives at major U.S. airlines recently expressed optimism about holiday travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If travelers feel the shutdown pain at airports, airlines feel it on their operations beyond the cancellations and delays. Among personnel furloughed are aviation-safety professionals, including aircraft-certification engineers and aerospace engineers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown also threatens to halt the progress U.S. airlines have seen in getting planes in and out of airports on time. Before the shutdown, U.S. delays and cancellations were trending down this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite several well-publicized problems in the spring, including a deadly air crash in Washington, D.C., and long delays at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, 2025 had been essentially tied with last year as far as the number of flights canceled or delayed for more than 15 minutes, the industry's on-time marker. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Rich fliers are making United and Delta billions by buying premium perks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Robert Schroeder in Washington contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Research from Harvard University professor Rebecca Diamond has shown that without high-skilled immigration, the U.S. would be one-third less innovative. Human capital is not the only key factor in U.S. innovation prowess, but by narrowing access to high-skilled talent from around the world, the U.S. could see slower productivity growth in the years ahead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other countries could gain major ground in the global battle for high-skilled talent thanks to the U.S.'s changing policies. America attracts the best and brightest workers from around the world, but now other countries are moving to open more doors for superstar talent, just as the U.S. tightens its pathways. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Source: Haver Analytics; author calculations </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Changes and challenges </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration imposed a $100,000 H-1B application fee in September. Prior to the proclamation, H-1B fees to the government ranged from $2,000 to $5,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The H-1B is a temporary work visa that requires at least a bachelor's degree and allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, healthcare and finance. The new fee would not apply to other visas - including, for example, student visas. Important questions remain about how and to whom the new fee will apply, but as written, its impact is certain, and designed to drastically increase the cost of using the H-1B program. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has since released guidance clarifying that the new fee will not apply to currently valid H-1B visas or to petitions requesting a change of status, amendment, or extension of stay for a beneficiary inside the United States. But the impact of the change is certain, with the cost of using the H-1B program set to rise drastically. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Supporters of the new policy say that the H-1B program reduces opportunities for American workers seeking highly paid jobs. However, this new fee is a blow to certain industries that now will face much higher costs to sponsor prospective hires, and it might deter overseas talent from coming to the U.S. For example, some tech companies have tens of thousands of staff on H-1B visas. Even if only a fraction of these companies' new hires require sponsorship, a $100,000 fee per petition adds up to many millions of dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The new fee will certainly have major impacts on the use of the H-1B program as a way to fill critical high-skilled workforce gaps,\" said Bo Cooper, executive director of the Fragomen Center for Strategy and Applied Insights. \"The United States is certainly still open for business for top international students and professionals, but employers will be monitoring carefully the aggregated impacts of these changes and the possible effects on their global talent strategies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The cost to U.S. innovation </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the U.S. at around 700,000, although there is no official data. That amounts to less than 0.5% of U.S. employees. Congress has limited the number of new H-1B visas to 85,000 per year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While H-1B workers are a small share of the U.S. workforce, policies aimed at reducing high-skilled immigration into the country could have outsize economic impacts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The study by Diamond and her co-authors found that immigrants account for 16% of inventors and authored 23% of patents, indicating that immigrants contribute an outsize share to innovation. (Diamond is an Andersen Institute advisory board member.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not only did immigrants author more patents, but Diamond's study also found that immigrants improved innovation for U.S.-born collaborators, pushing them to be more creative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In total, Diamond's study found that immigrants account for 32% of aggregate innovation, about half of which comes from improving the human capital of their native-born collaborators. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Source: Bernstein, Diamond, McQuade, and Pousada (2021) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Already, there are signs that the U.S. policy change is a golden opportunity for other countries to repatriate or attract superstar talent. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, in response to the hike in price for U.S. H-1B visas, the U.K. is said to be exploring proposals to abolish visa fees for skilled foreign workers, including scientists, academics and digital experts, in a bid to drive growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country would introduce new proposals to welcome skilled foreign workers. \"This is an opportunity for Canada,\" he said. In British Columbia, Jobs Minister Ravi Kahlon responded to Trump's policy by calling on workers in the U.S. to move north. \"We're inviting tech talent, innovators and scientists to come to B.C. and be part of building the economic engine of Canada's new economy!\" he wrote on the social-media platform X. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Considering the vital role that high-skilled immigrants play in driving innovation, if other countries can capitalize on this moment and attract a larger share of high-skilled talent from around the world, the implications could be profound. U.S. innovation exceptionalism, economic outperformance, and even the faster earnings growth of U.S. public companies compared to overseas peers, could all be threatened. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Khia Kurtenbach is chief of staff at the Andersen Institute for Finance and Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: I've got an H-1B work visa and I'm worried about my job status.

However, he has early-onset dementia, which has turned our lives upside down. I am in my mid-60s, at retirement age now, but I plan to work much longer. The property can make income too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is our second marriage. Luckily, I did not mix our finances. He was self-employed and had this 10-acre home for 30 years. We almost lost everything when he got sick. He was $20,000 behind in the mortgage. We have to refinance next year and pay his business debts off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I increased my income. I got caught up on the mortgage and I am making all the household bills. I have gotten our living expenses as low as I can, and I have dental and healthcare insurance for both of us. I plan on working for many more years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The cheapest route is to keep the property and refinance next year. There is a lot of equity. Do I ask for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage when we refinance? We plan on keeping the property in the family with help from them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We do have a will and are securing everything to protect us. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Second Wife </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My boyfriend, 69, moved in. He refuses to pay more than $1,300 in rent and won't do yard work. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Wife, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're faced up to this situation like a champ. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rather than get caught with an endless loop of questions like \"Why us?\" you just got on with it. You increased your income, and you are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. You are using the one asset he has to pay off his debts, and you're doing so with the cooperation and assistance of his family. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether or not you decide to go for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage depends a) on the interest rate and b) on your husband and his estate's ability to pay off this loan. There may come a time where you will need to sell this house to pay for care when his dementia progresses, but you can only ever do one thing, one day at a time. He is fortunate to have you at his side. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other long-term plans you can make. Your husband would do well to sign a power-of-attorney document while he is of sound mind and has the legal capacity to do so, if he has not done so already. The power of attorney should be \"durable\" and should specify that you will make decisions on his behalf when he is incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He can also assign you to hold power of attorney for healthcare decisions. This will ensure that he has someone to act on his behalf in a medical context. If he does not wish to be on life support, for example, this advanced healthcare directive would say so. A living will and/or living trust can also provide additional instructions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My husband has dementia and will need care. Will Medicaid go after my money if I use it to pay off our mortgage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Importantly, setting up a trust would help your husband's executor - that is, you - to avoid probate. Making sure you have these documents in place before he enters mid- or late-stage dementia will prevent complications later on, like having to apply to be his guardian or conservator, which can be a lengthy and complicated process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is also the time to look into Social Security benefits for your husband. \"Someone with early-onset Alzheimer's who is younger than 65 can qualify for fast-track eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits,\" according to AARP. \"After two years of receiving SSDI benefits, they can qualify for Medicare before age 65.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your husband could also purchase a private supplemental policy, Medigap, or look into a Medicare Advantage plan. \"Medicare will cover hospice care, which provides as much comfort as possible to terminally ill patients in the last days or months of life,\" AARP notes. \"A doctor must certify that they have a life expectancy of six months or less.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, what you have created for yourselves after this diagnosis is something that was taken from you at that time: certainty. You may not know exactly how much time it will take for your husband's dementia to progress to the stage where he will need full-time care, but you have put in place enough financial safeguards to protect you both when you get there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am highly alarmed by the proposed changes to retirement accounts': I don't want bitcoin or private equity in my 401(k). What can I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm 67.
