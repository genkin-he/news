            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jamie Chisholm </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about stock market exuberance build as AI tech spending sees shift to debt </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Burry was quoting the famous line from the movie Wargames, presumably about his willingness to participate in the AI-fueled bull market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's getting choppy. The heavy weighting afforded the megacap tech stocks meant the reception given to their third-quarter earnings was very likely to determine the stock market's short-term direction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And so, poorly-received reports from Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw the wider market retreat sharply on Thursday, while positivity over Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) results are pushing indices back up on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The volatility speaks to investors' sensitivity to any sign of cracks in the bullish AI narrative that is currently delivering stock market exuberance. And we can consider Michael Burry of hedge fund Scion Asset Management in the cautious camp. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a new message on X, Burry - who rose to fame after being featured in the Michael Lewis book \"The Big Short\" and was played by Christian Bale (below) in the movie  - delivered a poetic warning: \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" the latter a reference to the nuclear-showdown assessment from the movie Wargames. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because he is mainly known for his bets against esoteric credit assets ahead of the 2007-08 financial crisis, Burry is wrongly labelled as a perennial bear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that at the end of last year SAM held only long positions, with his top three bets on China's Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the end of the first quarter of 2025 he had tuned more cautious buying put options - a bet share prices will fall - on the three China tech companies. His biggest position was a put trade on Nvidia (NVDA), which did trend lower for the first four months of this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burry's next filing for the end of June shows that negative Nvidia position gone - though we don't know exactly when he closed it - which is just as well, because the chipmaker's stock has more than doubled since its April lows. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Instead, the portfolio was replete with bullish bets, including call options - the right to buy a stock - on Alibaba, Meta, ASML (ASML), UnitedHealth (UNH), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and lululemon athletica (LULU). Scion has held shares of Estee Lauder (EL) all year, the only constant. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burry's next 13-F for his holdings up to the end of September is due in about two weeks. It's still possible that it contains mainly long positions - after all the end of the third quarter was a month ago. But his latest social media message suggests he is nervous about the stock market's rally, and he's now adopting a much more defensive stance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One reason why observers like Burry may be getting more anxious is evidence of a shift in the funding of big tech capex. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Traders have been happy to see hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for AI-related investment, particularly as most of the money was sourced from company cashflow. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But Meta's recent deal to construct its Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, included a $30 billion financing package comprising mostly of debt held via a special purpose vehicle. The structure means Meta does not hold the debt on its balance sheet, helping to protect its credit rating. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The concern among some investors is that as companies look for ever more funding to deploy, they may use the Meta deal as a template. Spending cash from the kitty is clean, clear and less dangerous if things go wrong. Financial engineering using what could be called quantum debt, which can be two things at once - not debt according to the rating agencies, but Meta-backed debt according to the buyers - is more opaque and potentially more risky. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Financial Times and Bloomberg report that Meta is also looking at another $25 billion bond sale. Right now there's a prospectus filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission without a specified amount. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock-indices SPX DJIA COMP are higher at the opening bell as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y nudge up.

And it was something that Kelly Ripa, co-host of TV's \"Live with Kelly and Mark,\" addressed recently in a rant that has gotten attention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You know, we give good candy. Full-size candy. You think they'd take the win and say, 'Thank you.' But they go, 'I don't like Hershey's, can I get a Snickers bar? I want Skittles,'\" Ripa said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Her solution? \"I am tired of dealing with this. So, now I'm getting opaque bags and putting the candy in the bags and you get what you get. Bye-bye. See you later.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Ripa was speaking about the situation in New York City, there are no shortage of people complaining about the Halloween greed factor wherever they live. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One commenter on Reddit took note of kids who \"would grab a handful [of candy] when I would say 'grab 2 or 3.'\" Another commenter observed: \"It's not even little kids that are raiding the sweets, it's the older ones from 10-12 and teenagers and college kids that keep on taking the sweets.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Others describe scenarios even worse than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jan Norris, a resident of Riviera Beach, Fla., had to leave her home for a few minutes during one recent Halloween. So she put up a sign asking trick-or-treaters to take a limited amount of candy. But when she returned, she found everything was gone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I couldn't get over the audacity,\" she told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neither could Enid, a New Jersey resident who declined to give her last name. Not only did trick-or-treaters take all her candy one year after she, too, left her treats unattended, but they also swiped her porcelain Halloween bowl. Even more disturbing: Someone played a prank and damaged her electric doorbell, necessitating a repair that cost several hundred dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Enid told MarketWatch that she's given up on taking part in the Halloween ritual as a result. \"We're lights off,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Halloween is more expensive this year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, there are plenty of folks who continue to embrace the holiday - so much so that Halloween sales are projected to reach a record $13.1 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Candy sales account for $3.9 billion of that total. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There do appear to be growing expectations of full-size candy bars being doled out instead of the mini or \"fun size\" versions that were long the Halloween norm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But consumers may be feeling especially pinched this year when it comes to candy. Prices for the sweet treats are higher, particularly because of the rising cost of chocolate. Wells Fargo recently reported that cocoa prices have more than doubled since the beginning of 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tariffs have also had an impact on Halloween costs - most notably for decorations and costumes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Combine the greed factor with the price hikes and you have a recipe for misery, some say. In certain cases, people are reporting that their candy budgets are now $200 or more. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Moneyist (2024): This Halloween, I'm not buying candy for trick or treaters. I have better things to spend my money on. Am I a bad person? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not that you can't find ways to save. Some consumers say they find deals by shopping at warehouse clubs like Costco (COST), or through Amazon (AMZN). They can even find full-size bars at a decent price at those places. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Even with concerns about price increases due to tariffs, Halloween continues to resonate with consumers of all ages,\" said Katherine Cullen, vice president of industry and consumer insights at the NRF. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But as the NRF data suggest, it doesn't look like folks are giving up on the idea of spending big for Halloween - just the opposite, in fact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for problematic and demanding trick-or-treaters, Darby Fox, a child and family therapist based in the New York metropolitan area, says that's symptomatic of the times. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We don't teach manners anymore,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fox added that Halloween provides a good opportunity for parents to teach their children to be polite and graciously accept any treats they're offered. If anything, she suggests the holiday should be celebrated more as a fun, community event rather than a sugary free-for-all. \"It shouldn't be about the candy,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some also suggest that people should put the greed factor into perspective. That's the view of Lizzie LeBontemps, an artist who has made a specialty of Halloween songs. She notes there are still plenty of grateful trick-or-treaters out there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I get rude, greedy kids every single year - and also every single year, I get polite, delightful ones who compliment my decorations and exclaim with a delighted 'Thank you!' when I hand them treats,\" LeBontemps said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The Fund's distribution policy is subject to modification, suspension or termination by the Board of Directors at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada's economy remains weak but looks to have avoided back-to-back quarterly contractions, with a modest recovery in industry-level activity as the country comes to grips with the uncertainty of U.S. trade policy and tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Data from the national statistics agency shows gross domestic product unexpectedly fell in August, the fourth decline in five months and after upwardly revised growth the month before. Its advance estimate indicates a modest rise in output in September. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That suggests the economy grew 0.4% on an annualized basis in the latest quarter, a recovery after shrinking in the second quarter and close to the Bank of Canada's forecast for modest growth of 0.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Amid U.S. protectionism and the Trump administration's changing levies on imported goods, businesses in Canada have been forced to adapt to weakened demand and higher costs. The fallout has been particularly hard on trade-exposed sectors like manufacturing, though there have been signs the impact of the trade conflict is widening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canadian GDP, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy, declined 0.3% from the month before in August, Statistics Canada said Friday. Economists had been expecting flat activity, and the data agency's earlier flash estimate pointed to essentially unchanged industry-level activity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  GDP for July was revised upward to growth of 0.3%, the first expansion in four months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The agency's early estimate indicates GDP in September edged up 0.1% on-month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of Canada earlier this week cut its policy interest rate a second time in a row but signaled there was a bigger hurdle to any further easing as it balances risks to inflation against a recovery in the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central bank expects sluggish growth in the second half of 2025, held back by weak export volumes, uncertainty and Ottawa's efforts to slow immigration. Still, that would mean the country escapes a recession, marked by consecutive quarterly contractions, after GDP fell 1.6% annualized in the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Statistics Canada's early look at September indicates increases in finance and insurance, mining and oil and gas extraction, and manufacturing. These were partially offset by declines in wholesale and retail trade. The estimate is set to be updated Nov. 28, when official quarterly GDP figures will be released. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Industry accounts for August showed goods producing industries in particular struggled, with a fifth contraction since the beginning of the year. Services-producing sectors edged down, for the first decline in six months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Mining activity weakened, driven by falls in metal ore and coal, and rigging and drilling activity fell sharply. Oil and gas extraction tempered the decline, growing for a third month straight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canada's utilities sector weakened for the month, as a worsening drought continued to hamper hydroelectric power generation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Manufacturing in August faced broad declines, including in food production, machinery manufacturing and fabricated metal product making. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A strike by roughly 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants that began mid-month and led to flight cancellations dented air travel in August, and meant transportation activity overall fell for the first time in six months. Pipeline transportation also was lower, driven by lower natural gas activity that coincided with a drop in exports to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Wholesale trade in August declined for the first month in four, but retail trade saw widespread expansion, including increases at motor vehicle and parts dealers and at clothing and accessories stores. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Statistics Canada recently estimated retail sales, which have choppy for months, fell in September, while lower sales of machinery equipment and supplies likely meant wholesale sales were down slightly. An advance tally of factory trade indicated manufacturing sales climbed 2.8% month-over-month to reverse weakness in August. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"The weakness we are seeing in the Canadian economy is more than a cyclical downturn. It is also a structural transition,\" Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said this week, adding it was now harder to do business with the U.S., which has destroyed some of Canada's capacity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sector-specific U.S. tariffs continue to weigh on exports of motor vehicles, steel and aluminum, and more recent levies are expected to affect Canada's copper, furniture and softwood lumber. They also add to challenges for Canadian agriculture from Chinese tariffs on canola, peas, pork and seafood. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  President Trump last Thursday said he was cutting off trade talks with Canada and followed with a threatened additional 10% tariff on the country in response to an ad campaign that he said misrepresented comments by former President Ronald Reagan. American tariffs on Canada currently stand at 35%, with energy products at 10%, though goods that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement are carved-out of the duties. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of KB Insurance Co., Ltd.</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best</strong> has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a” (Excellent) of KB Insurance Co., Ltd. (KBI) (South Korea). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect KBI’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. The ratings also reflect the support that the company receives from its parent, KB Financial Group Inc. (KB Group) and its strategic importance to the parent.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nKBI’s risk-adjusted capitalisation is assessed at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s local solvency ratio remains largely in line with the industry average amid an unfavourable business environment, such as a decline in market interest rates and discount rate cuts by the local regulator. KBI exhibited good accessibility to the capital market underpinned by its recent and past successful issuances of subordinated debts, and maintains low debt leverage and healthy coverage ratios. The company’s investment strategy remains conservative, with a focus on asset liability management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses KBI’s operating performance as adequate, with its return-on-equity and combined ratios being largely in line with its domestic industry peers. The company’s major business line of long-term insurance is expected to be supported by the release of its large contractual service margin base, albeit facing headwinds in its profitability from an industry-wide increase in medical claims during 2025. While the auto line experiences some negative underwriting pressure, due to the cumulative effect of prior base rate cuts and inflation on repair costs, KBI remains focused on growing its online channel to improve its auto line profitability. This KBI hopes to achieve by economies of scale, despite the potential increase in expenses over the short term amid strong market competition. Interest income remains a major source of the company’s investment profits.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of KB Group, one of the largest financial holding companies in South Korea, KBI remains the fourth-largest non-life insurer in the country with a stable market share of approximately 13% based on gross insurance service revenue in 2024. Strategically, KBI is important to the parent in terms of business diversification, since it is the only non-life insurer within the group. Since its affiliation into KB Group in 2015, KBI has a track record of receiving explicit support including direct capital support and a no-dividend policy between 2019 and 2022, to bolster its capitalisation. Implicit support includes shared distribution channels and group-wide marketing activities under the KB Group brand in both domestic and overseas markets.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nNegative rating actions could occur if there is a significant deterioration in KBI’s balance sheet strength fundamentals or if support from KB Group is reduced to a degree that no longer supports the current level of enhancement. Positive rating actions could occur if KBI’s operating performance demonstrates strong and consistent results to positively distinguish itself from industry peers.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

Analyzing 5,873 safety liability accidents in China over 20 years, the researchers found that doubling PM<span data-v-479a2324=\"\">2.5 </span>concentrations led to a 2.6-fold increase in accident probability, 37% more deaths, and 51% more casualties. The findings highlight a critical but overlooked dimension of air pollution's social and economic burden.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Air pollution is widely recognized as a public health hazard, but its role in workplace safety is often underestimated. A new study reveals that polluted air can make industrial accidents both more likely and more severe, adding a hidden layer to their human and economic costs.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The research—led by Dr. Ning Zhang of Yonsei University in South Korea, in collaboration with Dr. Zaikun Hou of Shandong University and Dr. Huan Chen of the University of Cambridge—was published in <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4546215-1&amp;h=3706667197&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2FS0140988325007212%3Fvia%253Dihub&amp;a=Energy+Economics\" tabindex=\"0\">Energy Economics</a></em> on September 18, 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Using two decades of accident records from 2000 to 2020, the team matched each incident with local air pollution and weather data. By exploiting thermal inversions—meteorological events that trap pollutants—as an instrumental variable, they established a causal link between fine particulate pollution (PM<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2.5</span>) and safety liability accidents.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Their results show that doubling PM<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2.5</span> concentrations is associated with a 2.6-fold increase in accident risk, 37% more fatalities, and 51% more total casualties, with the strongest effects seen in coal mining and construction. These pollution-related accidents were estimated to cost society between USD 4.9 billion and 10.1 billion.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Our study shows that air pollution can significantly increase the occurrence and severity of safety liability accidents across industries</em>,\" said Dr. Zhang. \"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">This finding extends the social cost estimation of air pollution beyond traditional health and productivity losses, revealing a new dimension of its economic burden</em>.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">He added that the results echo a broader trend in research, noting that, \"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">the growing importance of this topic is reflected in recent work—for example, a 2025 Journal of Public Economics article by Victor Lavy and colleagues also finds that air pollution raises workplace accident risks. Together, these studies show that the safety impacts of air pollution are gaining increasing policy attention</em>.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The study also points to practical steps that companies and governments can take during pollution spikes, such as providing masks and air purifiers, improving ventilation, issuing early safety warnings, rescheduling high-risk work, or temporarily adjusting shifts. The researchers emphasize that greater defensive measures should be implemented during periods of severe air pollution or haze to minimize workplace risks and protect employee health.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Looking ahead, the researchers believe their findings could guide integrated environmental and occupational safety policies. \"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Over the next five to ten years, our findings could inform policies linking environmental regulation with workplace safety standards—encouraging industries to include air-quality indicators in their risk management and insurance systems</em>,\" Dr. Zhang noted. \"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">For ordinary people, such changes would mean safer workplaces, cleaner air, and more resilient communities</em>.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">While acknowledging potential limitations—such as underreported accidents and the focus on short-term exposure—the authors emphasize that their causal evidence, drawn from two decades of data, underscores an urgent need to address air pollution as a workplace safety issue, not just a health problem.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Media Contact:<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Jin Young Choi<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>82-2-2123-2079<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:403554@email4pr.com\" tabindex=\"0\">403554@email4pr.com</a> </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Reference<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>Title of original paper: Devil particles: Air pollution and safety liability accidents<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Journal: <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Energy Economics<br data-v-370fea16=\"\"/></em>DOI: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4546215-1&amp;h=3924934857&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.eneco.2025.108894&amp;a=10.1016%2Fj.eneco.2025.108894\" tabindex=\"0\">10.1016/j.eneco.2025.108894</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH11907&amp;sd=2025-10-31\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yonsei-university-study-finds-air-pollution-sharply-raises-workplace-accident-risk-302600680.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yonsei-university-study-finds-air-pollution-sharply-raises-workplace-accident-risk-302600680.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Yonsei University</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Things in 2025 turned out quite different than how investors feared after the election a year ago </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given the challenges AI is generating in the job market, Gen Z feels like it can only sustain its standard of living by investing in risk assets like stocks and crypto. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One year ago, as America was preparing for its hugely consequential presidential election, Bank of America's fund-management survey identified the three risks that troubled investors most for 2025. These were fears of a disorderly increase in U.S. government bond yields, the prospect of a trade war between the world's two military and economic superpowers, and the Fed tightening monetary policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The world looked like a very different place at the end of 2024 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fast forward one year, and Michael Hartnett's weekly Flow Show report notes mark that U.S. Treasury volatility is at its lowest level since 2021 with 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y recently dipping below 4%. Additionally, the U.S and China have struck a trade agreement featuring a 12-month truce on of tariffs, and, with the stock market setting record highs, the Fed has cut rates twice, with consensus still favoring further cuts into 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury volatility falls to its lowest level since 2021. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As investors enter the home stretch of 2025, the mindset is still skewed toward risk-on, buttressed by three unofficial \"puts\" that they believe establish a floor for risk-asset prices. Chief strategist Hartnett argued that those supporting struts are provided by the Fed (the promise of lower rates if the economy weakens); President Donald Trump (who feels it incumbent upon him to keep the stock market up to maintain his popularity ahead of midterm elections); and what Hartnett labeled the \"Gen Z put.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hartnett said this generation can only sustain its standard of living - in the face of AI-induced job losses - by sticking with its bid for risk, such as stocks and crypto. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hartnett emphasized that the stock market and crypto are terribly important for Gen Z to maintain their standard of living. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What could derail this seemingly impregnable positivity? Hartnett and his team said that inflation rising toward 4% would represent the biggest threat, because it would imperil the 81 separate rate cuts from a range of central banks, which Bank of America anticipates in 2026. By comparison, central banks have cut rates 129 times so far this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For now, the recommended strategy is that \"AI equity leadership ain't budging for the time being.\" Hartnett maintained gold (GC00)and China stocks MCHI as his preferred \"boom/ bubble hedges.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The contrarian trade at this juncture, Hartnett suggested, is to bet on a surprise tightening of financial conditions in the fourth quarter. He also remarked that investors should short hyperscaler bonds in 2026 because their spreads over U.S Treasurys are probably the tightest they will ever be, and AI capex - as illustrated by Meta's (META) bumper $30 billion bond deal this week - will be paid for not just out of revenues and cash flow, but also increasingly by debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
