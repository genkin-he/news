            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors are likely to refocus on potential 'AI winners,' according to UBS analysts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir Technologies' shares have been pressured by valuation concerns and broader market fears of artificial-intelligence-fueled disruption of software companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir Technologies' stock has been a fan favorite among retail investors. Now, Wall Street analysts are warming to the software company's story. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS analysts led by Karl Keirstead upgraded Palantir's stock (PLTR) to a buy rating, from neutral, on Thursday. The analysts wrote that it's now less of a \"struggle\" to justify the stock's valuation, as Palantir shares have come down 35% from their recent peak. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir's stock is currently trading at about $135. Keirstead has a $180 price target, implying upside of about 33%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir's most recent quarter was a record-setting one for the company, bringing both a beat on revenue and earnings expectations. But investors have gotten more nervous about the stock's high valuation and whether artificial intelligence will disrupt software companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When UBS began covering Palantir in December 2024, the stock was trading at 124 times estimates for fiscal 2025 free cash flow, Keirstead noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, as the stock has declined while estimates have still moved higher, Palantir's stock is trading at a comparably easier-to-swallow multiple of 50-times 2027 free-cash-flow estimates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS cast a hypothetical scenario where Palantir can grow at a roughly 50% compound annual rate over the next three years. In that scenario, the 2027 free-cash-flow multiple would be decreased to just one times its projected rate of growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This we believe is finally at a level that many investors can make a strong valuation case for the stock,\"  Keirstead said in a Thursday note, predicting that that investors will return to \"AI winner\" stocks like Palantir this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's not the only analyst showing more confidence in Palantir. About 60% of analysts covering the company now rate it at the equivalent of a buy, up from 25% in December, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mizuho's Greg Moskowitz last week upgraded the stock to outperform, from neutral. Like Keirstead, he cited the recent selloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Palantir is in a category of one, delivering total revenue growth, acceleration and margin expansion at scale that is unlike anything else in software,\" Moskowitz wrote in a note to investors. \"We believe the derating has occurred and that the risk/reward is now attractive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Palantir's stock looks less 'frothy' and is now worth buying, this analyst says </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, not everyone is bullish on Palantir. Two of the 31 analysts covering the stock have sell ratings, while 10 others have hold ratings, according to FactSet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Burry - the former hedge-fund manager featured in \"The Big Short\" for his bets against the housing market in the run-up to the global financial crisis - is shorting the stock. Recently, he highlighted that Palantir's accounts receivable have been growing faster than revenue for nine of the last 12 quarters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's \"a persistent pattern generally attached to nefarious tricks such as channel stuffing, aggressive revenue recognition or extended payment terms used as sales concessions,\" Burry said in a recent Substack post. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: They bet everything on Palantir and became millionaires. Inside the market's ultimate cult stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Part of it has to do with droughts and wildfires in the U.S. Midwest, as well as a deterioration in crop health in France. An attack by Russia on Ukrainian infrastructure in the port city of Odesa, and tensions between the U.S. and Iran that has traders across markets adjusting their positions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Taking Cues: Corn futures rose to the highest their level this year. The grain received support from higher crude oil futures as U.S.-Iran tensions remain unresolved heading into the weekend. \"The two sides will resume more technical discussions next week in Vienna,\" StoneX's said Arlan Suderman in a note. \"A bulked-up U.S. military presence in the Middle East remains.\" Corn's price is tied to oil due to ethanol, which is a major consumer of commodity that is an ingredient blended into American motor fuel. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Overseas Interest: The USDA reported a flash sale of U.S. corn exports for the second consecutive day, this time in a notice that said 257,000 metric tons were headed to \"unknown destinations\" for delivery in the 2025/26 marketing year. That phrase when included in USDA statements is often--but not always--used in connection with China. Grain traders continue to look for confirmation of China buying more U.S. soybeans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sticking Around: The latest U.S. inflation gauge showed price increases are likely to remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for a while.

Saefong and Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. government on Friday urged nonemergency government workers to leave Israel </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. State Department on Friday urged nonemergency U.S. workers to leave Israel after talks over Tehran's nuclear program ended Thursday without a deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices finished Friday at their highest level in roughly seven months, as President Donald Trump reportedly suggested that a U.S. military strike on Iran is still being considered following a failed attempt this week to reach a deal to end Tehran's nuclear ambitions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump told reporters outside the White House Friday that he would \"love not to use\" the U.S. military to attack Iran, but \"sometimes you have to,\" according to a report from CNBC. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The report also said that a final decision on whether to attack Iran has not yet been made. An emailed request to the White House from MarketWatch for further comment on Iran wasn't immediately answered. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices finished higher Friday in the wake of Trump's reported remarks. April West Texas Intermediate crude (CLJ26) (CL.1) rose 2.8% to settle at $67.02 a barrel - its highest finish since Aug. 1. The contract gained 0.8% for the week and rose 2.8% for the month of February, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     April Brent crude (BRNJ26) climbed 2.5% to settle at $72.48 a barrel, the highest since July 31. The contract gained 1% for the week and 2.5% for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The oil market is providing a reminder that until \"documents are signed and money changes hands, there is no deal,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Oman-mediated talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva ended on Thursday with \"significant progress,\" Badr Albusaidi, Oman's foreign minister, said in a post on X Thursday. He said talks would resume after \"consultation in the respective capitals,\" with the two sides holding \"technical level\" discussions next week in Vienna. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Talks are extending into another week, but ironically, the longer they go on, the higher oil prices seem to go. This is because the markets are sensing that the Iranians could be stringing [President] Trump along and at one point, Mr. Trump may lose his patience and tell his negotiators to come home,\" Edward Meir, an analyst at Marex, said in comments emailed Friday morning. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"At the end of the day, it should not take weeks and weeks to come to an agreement and the markets are getting nervous waiting,\" Meir added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: U.S.-Iran nuclear talks end, but with hope that negotiations continue. That still leaves the oil market in limbo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Congressional Democrats are expected to force a vote on a war powers resolution linked to Iran next week, in a bid to prevent Trump from taking military action against Iran without the prior approval of Congress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Friday saw the U.S. State Department authorize nonemergency U.S. government personnel and their family members to leave Israel \"due to safety risks,\" which weren't specified. The order also warned of potential restrictions on travel to areas of Israel, the Old City of Jerusalem and the West Bank, while suggesting \"persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump has said the U.S. military has assembled an armada of warships and fighter jets near Iran. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said markets are also focused on the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Sunday. There has been speculation that members may resume production increases starting in April, he said, after the group decided to leave output quotas unchanged for the first quarter of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"While OPEC+ estimates that supply and demand will be in balance throughout this year, the International Energy Agency maintains its forecast of an oversupply of 3.7 million barrels per day throughout 2026,\" Morrison said in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, an exchange-traded fund that tracks software stocks, was almost 2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns have been brewing among investors that AI could do away with the need for workers across sectors, from insurance to wealth management to real estate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors not only worry that AI efficiencies will drive companies to cut costs and head counts; they also fear that fewer employees will directly translate to shrinking demand for traditional software licenses. Many business-software companies sell their products based on customer head count, or on a per-seat basis, and investors are looking carefully at whether software companies will be hit by a decline in these subscriptions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So when Block (XYZ) announced on Thursday that it is cutting more than 40% of its employees, some analysts interpreted the news as a prequel to a future where AI will replace the workforce. And those fears hit software stocks that were trying to recover after weeks of negative sentiment driven by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Block job cuts are the latest blow to investor confidence in the software sector's ability to withstand the ongoing threat that AI will dramatically shift the future of work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Monday, software stocks lost over $200 billion in market capitalization after Citrini Research released a blog post depicting a hypothetical future where AI leads to mass layoffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Did a blog post just cause software stocks to lose more than $200 billion in market cap? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Truist Securities analyst Matthew Coad said in a note that Block may be a   \"case study\" for how companies' investments in AI could \"adversely impact employment rates.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     J.P. Morgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a note that a new \"world of work\" is \"impending,\" and that Block is \"proactively restructuring\" the company to adapt to that reality. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: The stock market is reflecting fears of an AI apocalypse for white-collar jobs </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat said in a note that she wonders if Block's move could lend credence to the \"unemployment fears\" that have \"gripped markets\" recently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Block may create a playbook for others,\" she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That said, some analysts believe that software stocks have been caught in an AI-driven downward spiral that won't last. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF looked poised to eke out a small gain for the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And some of the biggest software-sector declines on Friday seemed largely unrelated to the AI hysteria around Block's layoffs. Shares of Zscaler (ZS) and Elastic NV (ESTC) were losing more than 13% and 15%, respectively, as of midday, while PAR Technology's stock (PAR) was off nearly 30%. All three companies reported earnings on Thursday afternoon that were being poorly received by the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That said, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Friday note to clients that he expects the software space to see a \"major comeback\" in the coming months, as investors will recognize that the \"disconnected doomsday software trade\" is \"mispriced.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Hannah Pedone </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Such ratings changes usually provide a boost for a company's shares. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil futures jumped on Friday after nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva ended with no concrete agreements. Negotiations are set to resume next week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many airlines shield themselves from volatility in the price of fuel, which makes up a large part of their operational costs, by hedging it, usually using financial derivatives to try to spread their risk. But there has been a clear negative correlation between oil futures prices and airline stocks in recent years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Signs that inflation may persist and broader fears about artificial intelligence and tech stocks were also at play for U.S. equities, with some fearing that March will be another tumultuous month for the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. airlines enjoy broad-based demand and capacity is \"rational,\" the Cowen analysts said in their note about Southwest. The \"rising industry tide\" bodes well for the company, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The airline for years stuck with a one-size-fits-all approach that fell out of sync with competitors, which dove deeper into tiered fares and charging for different services as a way to drum up more profits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amid pressure from activist investors, Southwest announced sweeping changes a couple of years ago, including the end of its hallmark policies of open seating and no fees for checked baggage.
