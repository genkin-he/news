I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I'm in the home stretch': I'm 80.

So they're switching to hundreds of cheaper satellites you can replace fast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, China is practicing close-in orbital maneuvers. Russia is perfecting ways to blind satellites. I'm told these are defensive measures. Right. Like calling a $900 billion spending bill \"infrastructure.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is an investment theme, which means people are going to make money while the rest of us worry about whether GPS will work during the next international incident. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Terms you need to know so you don't sound stupid </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Space Force officers now use the phrase \"dogfighting in space\" to describe what China's been practicing. \"Top Gun\" in orbit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Responsive launch means ?America's Space Force can call on a Tuesday and ??launch on Wednesday. The U.S. proved this with Firefly Aerospace (FLY) in an exercise called VICTUS NOX. Firefly got the final orbital parameters with basically no warning and launched 27 hours later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Orbital combat is mostly non-kinetic these days, which is military-speak for \"We're screwing with each other but nobody's shooting yet.\" We're talking jamming, cyberattacks, sensor \"dazzling\" - which sounds like something from a Broadway show, but is actually blinding satellites and \"rendezvous-and-proximity operations\" - RPO for short. That's when one satellite sidles up to another and either fixes it or kills it, depending on whose satellite it is and what day of the week it is. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Space Force officers now use the phrase \"dogfighting in space\" to describe what China's been practicing. \"Top Gun\" in orbit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cislunar space is the area between Earth and the Moon, and it's becoming contested territory. The Air Force Research Lab tracks spacecraft beyond geosynchronous orbit - basically a traffic camera for the Solar System. Because if history teaches us anything, it's that humans can turn any frontier into a border dispute. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     War starts in space (how convenient) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Welcome to the 21st century, where your car's navigation system is a legitimate military target. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the day in 2022 that Russia invaded Ukraine, a cyberattack took out ViaSat's (VSAT) KA-SAT broadband service - a commercial satellite network - across parts of Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Civil aviation has diverted flights repeatedly because of GPS interference around the Baltic. This is the new normal. Welcome to the 21st century, where your car's navigation system is a legitimate military target. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What China and Russia are doing (Spoiler: nothing good) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Space Force officials say five Chinese satellites flew in tight formation last year, closing within meters of each other in coordinated patterns. If you're feeling generous, call it choreography. If you remember Pearl Harbor, call it a dress rehearsal. The Pentagon calls it \"synchronized proximity maneuvers,\" which is what happens when military bureaucrats try to describe dogfighting in space without using the word \"dogfighting.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In 2022, China's Shijian-21 docked with a dead BeiDou satellite and dragged it to a graveyard orbit. Debris removal, they said. Which it was. It's also exactly what you'd do in wartime if you wanted to remove someone else's satellite and make it look like housekeeping. It's the Swiss Army knife problem: It's not a weapon until you use the sharp parts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The international space treaty system is collapsing just as the hardware gets interesting. This has happened before: The Washington and London Naval Treaties limited battleship construction in the 1920s and 1930s, right up until Japan withdrew in 1934 and everyone started building again. World War II followed. It never ends well, but it's always profitable for somebody. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     America's strategy: More is more </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon's answer? The Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Yes, that's its real name. It's a 154-satellite mesh network designed to track missiles and route data around whatever? gets killed first. Launches are running roughly monthly into 2026. This is the Costco model of national defense: buy in bulk, expect casualties, keep the replacements coming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Twenty-one more satellites went up recently for what the Pentagon calls Tranche-1, the first batch of the 154-satellite network. Ten more Falcon 9 launches are already booked. Elon Musk is having a better decade in defense contracting than most people have in life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Space Force has just awarded contracts to SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin for their big launches. They also brought in new companies for smaller missions, which is Washington's way of saying \"We need more vendors because we're about to need a lot of launches.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rocket Lab (RKLB) is the small-launcher outside of SpaceX that works. Rocket Lab is part of the VICTUS HAZE exercise - the sequel to VICTUS NOX, because the military is now doing franchise launches, paired with a startup for rapid-response missions that include on-orbit maneuvering. Rocket Lab also builds spacecraft, which matters because the Pentagon is buying satellites by the hundreds now. Build them and launch them? That's two revenue streams. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The moon is back (unfortunately) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beijing brought back lunar samples in 2024 and is building a Moon base with Russia. Yes, Russia - the country whose satellite-navigation system barely works. This should go well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. is commercializing lunar access. NASA's CLPS program pays private companies to land cargo on the Moon. These are simple delivery contracts, not government megaprojects. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Intuitive Machines (LUNR) landed the first American spacecraft on the Moon since Apollo in 2024. More contracts are coming. This is logistics infrastructure for military and commercial operations between the Earth and the Moon. Watch Intuitive Machine's landing-success rate and contract flow. Either this becomes a business or it doesn't. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Firefly Aerospace followed Intuitive Machines with Blue Ghost in March 2025 - a full 14-day surface mission before the lunar night shut everything down. Firefly is acquiring SciTec for missile-warning analytics, which means they're building a vertical stack: responsive launch, lunar missions, in-space services and defense analytics. This is either visionary integration or an earnings-call disaster. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Debris: The problem everyone ignores until it hits them </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Kinetic antisatellite weapons - the kind that blow things up - make clouds that last decades. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you want something to worry about late at night besides your mortgage, pick orbital debris. Kinetic antisatellite weapons - the kind that blow things up - make clouds that last decades. Everyone knows this. Everyone has an incentive to jam, hack or tow before they smash. That's why debris removal is moving from feel-good environmentalism to actual procurement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Astroscale (JP:186A) (ASRHF) is the pure play here. Debris removal and satellite life extension - Astroscale is the only company where this is the whole business model. Picks-and-shovels for the orbital-trash problem. This Japanese company will either get contracts from governments that suddenly care about space junk, or they won't. If they do, it's a business. If they don't, it's a tax loss. Watch for government contracts and technical demonstrations: actually capturing debris, extending a satellite's life and proving the robotics work in orbit. I'd say watch for revenue, but that might be optimistic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One other cheerful note: The International Space Station deorbits in 2030. NASA plans to bridge to commercial stations, but government schedules are about as reliable as a drunk's promises. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If those slip, China's Tiangong could be the only crewed outpost in orbit for a while. That'll be awkward at the next diplomatic summit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is about money, not destiny </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon doesn't need exquisite systems that do everything perfectly. It needs good-enough systems it can afford to lose and replace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Proliferated constellations and responsive launch means an economic model of lower costs per unit, higher volumes and faster replacement. It's the shift from battleships to PT boats, from handmade suits to off-the-rack ones. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon doesn't need exquisite systems that do everything perfectly. It needs good-enough systems it can afford to lose and replace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors don't need to know when the shooting starts. They need to own the companies that get paid whether it starts or not. That's the beauty of defense contracting: The threat is enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bottom line </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The question is not whether space defense spending is real, it is whether these companies can execute at scale. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market has already been pricing in this growth. Rocket Lab's stock is up 540% year-to-date. Firefly's stock is down 51% since its IPO - one of the few not following the rally. Intuitive Machines' stock is up 30%. Astroscale's stock is up 18% since listing in Tokyo. The smart money got in two years ago, when these were speculative bets. Now these companies are defense contractors with actual revenue. That does not mean you are late. It means the thesis is proving out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Are these stocks fully valued? Rocket Lab trades at 52 times trailing revenue, with a $1 billion backlog. About 58% of that should convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Space Force contracts currently provide roughly 6% revenue visibility, with more upside ahead as U.S. military demand accelerates. The question is not whether space defense spending is real, it is whether these companies can execute at scale. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  11-01-25 1334ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 8, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Marex sold over-the-counter financial instruments to itself; (2) Marex had inconsistencies in its financial statements between its subsidiaries and related parties, including as to intercompany receivables and loans; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Marex's financial statements could not be relied upon; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Marex's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Marex class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547158-1&amp;h=891133420&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D43100&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D43100\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43100</a> call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Naeem Aslam </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Structural problems including high debt levels, deficits and geopolitical risks remain </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weakness in the short term doesn't end the bullish case for gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although I have an overall positive view on gold (GC00) as an investment, it may have peaked for the year. At the same time, I wouldn't view the current correction as an alarm to sell out of gold altogether. Instead, it's an opportunity, a prime moment for long-term investors to extend an investment or to average in, given that the fundamental long-term thesis has been validated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's important for investors to keep in mind that short-term market fluctuations driven by investment headlines and central banks need not factor into an investor's long-term perspective. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Decoding headlines and market sentiment </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although relief from market uncertainty seems possible due to the positive attitudes toward U.S.-China trade talks, gold nonetheless responds to central-bank actions. This week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting may be the most important factor influencing gold's medium-term trajectory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The financial markets now expect a 25-basis-point cut to the Fed's benchmark interest rate, but it's important to focus on the guidance that Fed Chair Jerome Powell provides. Will the Fed have a dovish bias on inflation and interest rates, or become more cautious? The information that has come in - such as lower inflation data and lower manufacturing data in the central bank's 12 regions - has boosted the dovish camp. But markets may change course relatively quickly if the Fed's guidance shifts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In such a situation, this correction in gold may become an investment opportunity. Gold prices tend to rise as the yield curve eases and the returns on alternative investments become less lucrative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It is also important to keep in mind that most of the recent data released are still coming out under the limitations of the U.S. government shutdown - so be careful in reading those numbers or forming an opinion based on them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The experts who previously warned against gold as an inflation hedge now argue there's room to grow </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Broader buying opportunity </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The overall macroeconomic environment encourages long-term investment in gold. Structural problems including high debt levels, deficits and geopolitical risks remain. The latest actions by the U.S. government include placing tariffs on Chinese goods and additional sanctions against officials in China's Ministry of State Security, as well as assessing Chinese compliance with various agreements. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although some indicators point toward moderation, like deceleration of inflation levels (keeping in mind that such data are affected by the U.S. government shutdown), the political and economic climate overall is turbulent. These conflicting signals highlight gold's significance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From a technical perspective, gold now looks oversold. We are likely to see prices moving back up in the short term before the correction continues - if it continues. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Based on these factors, it seems that the most sensible decision for investors now would be to look at the recent correction as an opportunity to buy. It's always sound strategy to realize gains should you be heavily positioned, but I wouldn't advocate liquidating your entire investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If Fed exhibits dovish statements - either by cutting rates or being quite accommodative in its statements - it would not be long before gold rallies. But if the central bank makes less dovish statements than expected, it may keep gold prices momentarily dormant. Still, the underlying case for gold remains intact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weakness in the short term doesn't end the bullish case for gold. The trick is to position perfectly by locking in some profits and being ready to add to positions on dips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Naeem Aslam is chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets in London. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Why I'm buying more gold </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: The Fed has a strong case for an October rate cut - but investors should brace for anything </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Naeem Aslam </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The Inclusive Growth Score (IGS) provides local partners, policymakers, community leaders and impact investors with a clear, simple view of social and economic indicators at the neighborhood level. These results help them understand what's working and what needs help.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Using the Inclusive Growth Score platform, teams will analyze data related to housing affordability, small business growth, health coverage, and early education enrollment to uncover patterns and design interventions. Proposed solutions may range from policy recommendations and workforce development programs to AI-powered digital tools that promote equitable growth.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Students will apply data science techniques — including statistical modeling, visualization, and predictive analytics — to uncover insights and propose solutions that promote economic equity, workforce growth, and community resilience.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Throughout the challenge, teams will participate in virtual workshops, mentorship sessions, and in-person pitch stops at partner HBCUs, including Alabama A&amp;M University, Jackson State University, Fisk University. Upcoming stops include: Bowie State University(11/13), and Grambling State University(11/20). The competition will culminate in the Finalist Showcase and Awards Ceremony, held from December 4 to 6, 2025, at Mastercard's Atlanta headquarters, where top teams will present their findings to corporate and community leaders. A total of $52,400 in cash prizes will be awarded, including a $15,000 grand prize for the first-place team.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information about the 2025 Mastercard Data Challenge, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547269-1&amp;h=1675153886&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdatascience.aucenter.edu&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fdatascience.aucenter.edu\" tabindex=\"0\">https://datascience.aucenter.edu</a> or contact Jamal Ware at <span class=\"mdc-article-underline\" data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:jware@aucenter.edu\" tabindex=\"0\">jware@aucenter.edu</a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About the AUC Data Science Initiative</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">The Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative (AUC DSI) serves as a hub for data science education, research, and collaboration across Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Morehouse School of Medicine. Through partnerships with industry leaders such as Mastercard, Google, and UnitedHealth Group, the initiative builds student pipelines into data-driven careers while ensuring HBCU representation in the evolving tech and analytics landscape.</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL13049&amp;sd=2025-11-01\"/></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atlanta-university-center-consortium-and-mastercard-partner-to-launch-2025-data-challenge-empowering-hbcu-students-to-drive-inclusive-growth-302601545.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atlanta-university-center-consortium-and-mastercard-partner-to-launch-2025-data-challenge-empowering-hbcu-students-to-drive-inclusive-growth-302601545.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Atlanta University Center Consortium</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account. I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I have a considerable amount of unrealized capital gains in this fund and can't decide whether selling some or all of it and paying the taxes makes sense, or if I should wait through the coming decline.

Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported their quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm.

Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, it's probably better the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Why are we normalizing $20 lunches?!\" Workers balk at the surging price of the midday meal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average weekly tab for lunch is now $108.68, according to a new survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Has lunch become a luxury item? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's the question many are asking in light of rising prices for food in general - and dining out in particular. And it's something borne out by a new survey from ezCater, a food-focused tech platform, that shows Americans are now spending $108.68 each week on their Monday-through-Friday lunches. That's up from $88.44 a year ago - a spike of more than $20. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The survey, which encompassed 1,000 full-time U.S. employees, also notes that 51% of workers said they skip lunch once a week. And while work factors play into this - meaning people are sometimes too busy at their jobs to grab a bite - 17% of those surveyed said they forego the midday meal to save money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even those who do have lunch are making accommodations to counter rising costs, with 33% saying they are buying lunch out less frequently and 18% saying they're opting for smaller portions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But you don't have to take the survey's word for it. Just ask most anyone who's looked at their lunch tab lately. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Andrew Hickey, who runs a media-relations company based in the New York metro area, says he goes out for lunch a few times a week. His tab easily runs $18, even for just a bowl of greens, he notes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Salad has become expensive, especially if you're adding protein to it,\" Hickey said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He added that he's learned to avoid delivery because it can jack up the price considerably when factoring in the fees and tip. Suddenly, a lunchtime burrito costs $25, Hickey notes. \"That's when it really shocked me,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Such sentiment is echoed throughout social media. On one TikTok video, someone questions: \"Why are we normalizing $20 lunches?!?!\" On another (expletive-filled) one, someone similarly declares: \"How the f- are we supposed to afford lunch at the office? Like, every fast-casual place around here is $19 for a bowl of slop.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But restaurateurs say they don't have much choice: The cost of doing business is such that they have to charge what they charge. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alex Compton, owner of Compton's Sandwich Shop, a growing chain with locations in New York and New Jersey, points to the fact his costs for protein items (as in meat) have increased 20% in the past year, while his costs for produce are up by 14%. He tries to keep prices low, but his sandwiches can still run to $18, which can become a challenge for some customers, he admits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're at a threshold here,\" said Compton of the current state of lunch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Compton has rolled out a daily $16.95 lunch special, which includes a sandwich, drink and chips, to ease the burden and keep customers coming back. He's not alone in that regard; many restaurant chains, especially in the fast-food and fast-casual sectors, have done the same. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most notably, McDonald's (MCD), which has faced criticism for higher prices in the last few years, recently rolled out a series of deals, including $8 \"Extra Value Meals.\" In a statement, Joe Erlinger, president of U.S. McDonald's operations, said the chain is \"laser-focused on delivering value and affordability for our customers.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Certainly, consumers can take advantage of such savings. Others are finding different ways to lower their lunch burden, especially by preparing their meals at home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And some are turning to MealPal, a subscription service that offers savings of up to several dollars per lunch through restaurants in the 20 cities it services. The growing company, which is privately held, doesn't reveal how many subscribers it has, but says tens of thousands of lunches are ordered on its platform each day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One final option: Companies can provide lunch for their employees for free or at a subsidized cost. Experts say this could become more commonplace, given the need to hire or retain top talent and the fact lunch is becoming an increasing financial burden for workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Steve Zagor, a food-industry consultant who also teaches at Columbia University, is among those who think companies will have to embrace this idea. Otherwise, workers could be left hungry - and unhappy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Plus, Zagor reminds us that from a dietary standpoint, lunch is often considered the most important meal of the day. There's a reason why many Europeans focus heavily on midday dining. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you're going to have a big meal, it's better to have it at lunch,\" Zagor said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
