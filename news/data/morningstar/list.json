Saefong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The crude-oil market is seeing a 'rare occasion' where supply risks are more focused on the Americas </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Any potential U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites could pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power - and that raises significant risks for oil markets, said the Price Futures Group's Phil Flynn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Escalating U.S. tensions with Venezuela and an upcoming monthly decision by major oil producers on crude output targets were the focus of traders heading into the weekend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. plans to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment, the Miami Herald reported Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In response to the report, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told MarketWatch in an email that \"unnamed sources don't know what they're talking about. Any announcements regarding Venezuela policy would come directly from the President.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, oil prices found some support in the wake of the news report of potential strikes, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery (CLZ25) (CL.1) edged up by 0.7% to settle at $60.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices still ended lower for the week and declined for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although the U.S. already has certain sanctions on Venezuela in place, \"those do not impact physical [oil] production and transport in the same way that possible damage from military activity could,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \"So this appears to be forcing investors to adjust their supply-risk expectations.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is a \"rare occasion,\" Cieszynski noted, where \"supply risks are more focused in the Americas.\" He pointed out that U.S. crude prices traded up a bit more during Friday's session than global benchmark Brent crude. Brent's January contract (BRNF26) - which became the front month at the end of the session - moved up by 0.6% to settle at $64.77 on ICE Futures Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites would potentially pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \"This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The situation, meanwhile, could overshadow concerns about the recent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft Oil Company and Lukoil OAO, said Flynn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil traders also are anticipating the latest decision by the major oil producers known as OPEC+ over the weekend. The group plans to hold its monthly meeting on Sunday and is expected to decide on production targets for the month of December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the last meeting in early October, OPEC+ agreed to increase production in November by another 137,000 barrels a day, despite rising concerns of a global supply glut. The group has been announcing monthly production increases since April. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In 2026, the global oil market may see an average surplus of 4 million barrels per day, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and World Bank Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: An oil supply glut could sink prices to $35 a barrel next year. Why the U.S.-China trade truce won't change that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the short term, analysts were expecting oil officials to announce a similar rise of 137,000 barrels per day in production targets, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But long term, it looks as if the oil market wants to go lower, retesting the double bottom from this past May of $55 front-month WTI, he said in emailed comments to MarketWatch Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The reason is simply the ongoing slowdown in global demand growth, against recent reports that there will be a supply overhang of around 4 million bpd next year,\" said Morrison. \"That could be countered by U.S. sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil, but I don't think traders put much store in the effectiveness of sanctions.

            "title": "Hotel stays now can easily cost $100 extra, thanks to local 'bed taxes'",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some locales, like Kyoto and San Diego, are increasing the taxes they levy on visitors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These days, local taxes can easily add more than $100 to the bill for a hotel stay - and the businesses don't even get the money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your hotel bill may soon be getting higher - and it could have nothing to do with the room rate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A number of cities are upping the taxes they levy on hotel guests. The add-on expense, sometimes referred to as a \"bed tax\" or \"tourist tax,\" can equate to hundreds of dollars in certain instances, depending on the locale and how long a guest stays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example: In Washington, D.C., the hotel tax now stands at 15.95%, following a slight increase approved by city officials in 2022 that was recently extended to September 2027. For a four-night stay at a hotel that charges $216 a night - the average daily D.C. room rate, according to CoStar, a real-estate analytics company - that comes out to $138 in bed taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But it can get more expensive in other markets: In Kyoto, one of Japan's most popular tourist destinations, a new bed-tax rate that is set to go into effect next March adds as much as $65 a night to a hotel stay. That translates into a $455 add-on for a week's visit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other municipalities that have hopped on the bed tax-hike bandwagon include San Diego (from 10.5% up to 13.75%); Aurora, Ill. (from 3% to 6%); and Oklahoma City (from 5.5% to 9.25%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's no secret why cities levy these taxes and often opt to increase them: It's a way of raising revenue without tapping local residents for more. And the money generated, which can total millions of dollars over time, is often tied to tourism, as in marketing campaigns designed to attract visitors to the destination. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, no visitor likes paying these taxes, but cities are hopeful that the amounts will be small enough that it won't stop tourists from coming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You don't want to discourage usage,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Holt noted that the city made sure that its bed-tax rate wouldn't be out of line compared to competing municipalities. \"We did all the research,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A similar point was raised by tourism officials with Washington, D.C., who said that the city's 15.95% bed-tax rate is still lower than or on par with a number of prominent municipalities across the country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Indeed, a 2024 study from the U.S. Travel Association, in partnership with consulting firm Civitas, found the average lodging levy to be 15.22%. That's up from 14.52% in 2018. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amanda Belarmino, a tourism expert who teaches at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's William F. Harrah College of Hospitality, said the increase in bed-tax rates may be partly due to the pandemic and the need for cities to make up for lost revenue. But she said other factors are also at play, including the aforementioned hard-to-ignore reality that it's \"more politically popular\" to stick tourists with a tax hike than locals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But will tourists push back at some point and just avoid visiting because of higher bed taxes? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We have not seen a lot of evidence of 'sticker shock' as of yet,\" Belarmino said. But she didn't rule out the possibility that some of the recent nationwide decline in tourism, especially among foreign visitors, could be attributable to traveler frustration with taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Milos Eric, co-founder of OysterLink, a hospitality-job platform, believes hotels in certain locales are definitely taking a hit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In some of the most popular cities with the biggest taxes, we're seeing more travelers shift to alternative accommodations or to the suburbs to keep their overall price down on the stay,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another point of concern among travelers: Bed taxes are not always fully made known - at least at first glance - when looking at room rates online. That is, you might see a posted rate for the room itself, but when you go to book, you'll find the add-on expenses, which can include taxes as well as those ubiquitous resort fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's frustrating that some platforms are fully transparent while others hide additional charges until checkout, making it hard to compare costs accurately,\" said Caroline Morse Teel, executive editor of the SmarterTravel website. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But Circle is basically a money-market fund with tech wrapping. If they're holding $500 billion to $1 trillion in Treasurys and rates move 100 basis points, that's a massive duration risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We lived through Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). I watched \"safe\" Treasury positions blow up when liquidity disappeared. Why wouldn't Circle face the same disaster if they scale to Fed infrastructure levels? Or are you assuming they'd have Fed backstop facilities similar to the discount window? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, political question: Can you imagine [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren's reaction when a private crypto company becomes systemically important to U.S. banking? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Patricia </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Patricia, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're asking the right question, which is why you're in finance and not a crypto influencer with a YouTube channel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yes, Circle faces duration risk if it scales to the $500 billion to $1 trillion range. And yes, SVB should terrify anyone paying attention. But here's the critical difference: SVB was a bank pretending to be a tech company. Circle is a tech company that would become, if my thesis plays out, a systemically important financial institution - whether they want to or not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Circle gets Fed backstop facilities, discount-window access, FDIC insurance on USDC (or something functionally equivalent) and enough regulatory scrutiny that its compliance department becomes larger than its engineering team. It becomes a boring utility that happens to process a trillion dollars in settlements annually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Will Circle's executives like this? Probably not. Will they have a choice? No. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your political instinct is correct. Pick any regulator - they'd all lose their minds. But here's the beautiful irony: The solution to \"private crypto company becomes systemically important\" is to wrap it in so much regulation and government backstop that it becomes de facto nationalized. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Circle becomes the post office of digital money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Circle becomes the post office of digital money. Boring, essential, quasigovernmental and impossible to kill. Its executives will spend more time in Senate hearings than in board meetings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for duration risk: If Circle reaches Fed infrastructure scale and doesn't have sophisticated risk management, it deserves what happens. But unlike SVB, it won't be allowed to fail quietly. Too many banks depend on it by that point. The Fed either backs it or admits the system was always a house of cards. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I know which way I'd bet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     P.S. Somewhere in Circle's San Francisco office, there's a founder who dreamed of disrupting banking. That person is now filling out their 47th regulatory filing of the week. This is what winning looks like. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Charlie, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You explained Fed policy, made me laugh and validated my rage all in one article. That line - \"And you wonder why nothing works anymore\" - should be on a T-shirt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My insurance premiums are up 40%, my grocery bill is insane, and now I find out the Fed is losing $200 billion annually on a problem they created? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If the Fed is this incompetent with banking system liquidity, why should I trust them with anything? Shouldn't I buy silver, gold and bitcoin and give up on the dollar entirely? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Peter </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Peter, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Should you trust the Fed? Of course not. They pay banks $200 billion a year not to use something banks actually need. Then everyone stands around, confused about why the system doesn't work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But distrusting the Fed and abandoning the dollar are completely different moves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your landlord doesn't accept silver. Your insurance company doesn't take bitcoin. And the IRS will hear your theory about returning to the gold standard - right before they garnish your wages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed deserves every bit of your skepticism. Your grocery bill proves it's either lying or incompetent, possibly both. But being angry at the system and having a workable alternative to the system are two completely different problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One is easy. The other requires moving to El Salvador. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     P.S. I agree about the T-shirt. If I make one, I'll send you the first copy. Won't fix your grocery bill, but at least you'll look good being angry about it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Charlie, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Futures prices are already anchored in the stock markets, even without the eight-hour funding rate settlement. Technically, perpetual futures should function efficiently without the need for periodic settlements or payouts every eight hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, regarding the discussion about bank leverage, reserves, clearing and liquidity - it seems there could be a more robust approach. For instance, banks could provide security against the leverage they extend, drawing from their reserves, assets and collateral they receive from borrowers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Leverage providers could be incentivized throughout an ongoing perpetual-futures trade by receiving a nominal, dynamically adjusted fee based on the trade's duration. That would create a simpler, more transparent and self-sustaining system without generating systemic stress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Patrick </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We're stuck with eight-hour settlements because changing requires admitting we were wrong, and financial people would rather eat glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Patrick, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You've stumbled onto something embarrassing: The entire financial system is running on technology designed by people who thought eight-hour intervals were sophisticated because they could divide 24 by three. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Perpetual futures don't need eight-hour cycles. BitMEX picked eight hours in 2016 because it was tidy, not because physics demanded it. It's the QWERTY keyboard of crypto - we're stuck with it because changing requires admitting we were wrong. Financial people would rather eat glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The funding rate simply needs to keep futures prices honest by making arbitrage attractive. DeFi protocols figured this out years ago. Perpetual Protocol does it every block - constantly funding settles in seconds. No more timing games. No more sophisticated traders opening positions after funding and closing before the next one, like teenagers sneaking home after curfew. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Why haven't Binance and Bybit adopted this? Because they're making money on the current stupidity. Never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake - especially when you're the one collecting fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now for the truly hilarious part: U.S. banks get free intraday overdrafts from the Fed. Zero cost. Just post some collateral and overdraw all you want, as long as you're square by 6 p.m. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before 2008, banks paid market rates for intraday liquidity. This created what economists call \"discipline\" and normal people call \"not being morons.\" After 2008, the Fed decided to give away the store. Massive reserves, free overdrafts, zero price signals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The result? Banks are sitting on trillions in unproductive reserves because they have no idea what liquidity costs. Neither does anyone else. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed's own economists admit intraday credit has real value, but refuse to charge for it. It's like running a bar where the drinks are free, but you need a credit card on file. Everyone gets drunk and nobody learns anything. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your proposal - dynamic fees based on duration, real collateral, transparent pricing - isn't radical. It's how perps already work. Crypto traders in 2025 have better risk management than Bank of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Banks could do continuous settlement. They could price intraday credit dynamically. They could manage collateral instead of tracking it in Excel like it's 1987. Technology exists. What's missing is the willingness to admit that the current system is a tire fire wrapped in compliance theater. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So yes, your idea works. And yes, it'll happen. Either because banks wise up, or because the next crisis forces regulators to stop pretending that free liquidity and moral hazard are sound public policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm betting on the crisis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yours in fiscal anarchy, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     P.S. The really depressing part? Someone at the Fed likely has already written a paper explaining all of this. It's sitting in a drawer somewhere, gathering dust next to the report about how maybe we shouldn't have bailed out everyone in 2008. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie Garcia is founder and a managing partner of R360, a peer-to-peer organization for individuals and families with a net worth of $100 million or more. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Agree?

In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree.'Hemant Taneja </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hemant Taneja is a venture capitalist, author and CEO of General Catalyst, recognized for his insights into how artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and economies. Taneja was an early investor in companies including Stripe , Snap (SNAP), Grammarly, and Anduril, with a focus on applied AI, healthcare transformation and responsible innovation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His new book, \"The Transformation Principles: How to Create Enduring Change\" (co-authored with Kevin Maney), outlines nine principles for companies and managers to create sustainable change. Under Taneja's leadership, General Catalyst has raised billions of dollars while emphasizing ethical AI deployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In this recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Taneja discusses how individuals and companies can transform themselves, notes AI stocks with growth potential, and explains AI's huge risk and major opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What's the central message of your new book, and why is it timely now? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: We are entering a technology cycle where AI is going to be a transformative force, and it's going to transform many industries. There is an opportunity to actually make capitalism work for everybody if we make the right intentional choices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What does a company need to do to have a successful transformation through AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: For an organization to be transformative, it needs to have a culture of curiosity and generosity. They need to transform, but not disrupt. Disruption is the alternative to transformation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Should an individual begin transforming themselves today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: You have to. Steve Jobs said that first we have to change ourselves, then we change our industry, and then we change the world. We have to transform ourselves to deliver greater value and then gain the ability to transform the industries that we work in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Is AI going to be more transformative than the internet? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: It will be bigger. When the internet came, it was all about making things more efficient, but humans were still doing the work and software was making them more efficient. With AI, you're basically saying it will do the same job as a human for the most part. When ChatGPT first arrived, every CEO in every industry and in every country was thinking about what to do with it. It was the first time a technology hit the zeitgeist across the entire world at the same time (i.e., it became a global cultural phenomenon). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Many employees fear that AI means job loss. How can leaders introduce it in a way that builds trust and gets people on board? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: Change is scary for a lot of people, which is why trust matters. If AI people came into your company and said to your employees, \"We are going to transform your business,\" the natural response is that you're going to kill their jobs. That's because you didn't take the time to build trust. Instead, tell them, \"We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.\" They would embrace it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Which companies are getting AI adoption right today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: In my book I talked about companies such as Applied Intuition, Hippocratic AI, Stripe and Commure. Some of the AI model companies are obviously doing very well. If you look at the consensus, it would be OpenAI and Anthropic. There are also open-source companies, such as Mistral, that are building AI models that are quite interesting. There are also companies that are imagining modern call centers, the evolution of the legal department, how accounting is being done with AI, how marketing and sales are going to be done using AI, and how to empower sales reps. Those types of companies are going to be very, very interesting over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest risks of AI adoption? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja:  We are going to transition from a culture of solving problems to a culture of asking questions, which will be a big transition. We want to make sure we're not losing our cognitive capabilities, our ability to think, and our ability to solve problems. How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? There is a trap you can fall into, whereas these technologies get better and better, and you stop thinking. Think about how to get from point A to point B today. People turn on the map program and lose all touch of how things are laid out physically. You don't want that to happen to all concepts in your brain. It is a downside if we become too reliant and give up sharpening our own cognitive skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What are the key steps leaders must take to successfully integrate AI into their organizations? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There are four steps leaders must take to make AI work: First, they have to change their data infrastructure and their IT (information technology) department so they can adopt AI. Then they must train them with the data. Next, they have to change their workforce because they now have humans and AI working together. What a lot of CEOs got wrong is they didn't realize that the only way a profound change will happen in their company is if they demonstrate courage and conviction. They have to encourage their people to take risks and show them how it will make them more successful. Otherwise, people get scared, and they won't use it. That's how a lot of organizations get stuck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What is the biggest cautionary lesson leaders should keep in mind as they adopt AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There will always be those who use AI for societal harm. We have to trust the system to build the right guardrails. Over time, this technology will be properly regulated in terms of who gets access to it and how it gets applied. Like any new technology, it could be bumpy. I have an optimistic view that human beings will find a way to leverage these profound technologies for good in the aggregate, such as what happened with nuclear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: With AI reshaping so many industries, how can employees protect their careers and make sure they thrive in an AI-driven workplace? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: The most concrete and useful advice I can give is to learn how to adopt AI to do your job more effectively. That's really what you should be doing. This means asking the right questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and being more strategic in your own work. It's a huge opportunity for employees. In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What guidance would you give recent graduates entering today's fast-changing job market? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: To understand that the world is going to change a lot in the next few years. When kids used to graduate 10 years ago, they would list all the software they knew how to use on their resume. Now we're in a world where that software is changing every three months, and you're constantly having to learn and keep up to be effective at your job. Being a lifelong learner is important. The world is an empty canvas. Let's have AI shape the world to be what we want it to be. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Looking ahead, how do you see AI reshaping society and business in the years to come? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: AI is a transformative force, and we have an amazing opportunity in front of us to transform society, to transform nations, to transform industries, and to transform our own business with AI with this mindset of abundance, of building companies that are truly focused on purpose and profit. We need to find the ingredients required to be able to build companies that can be agents of such transformations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Sincere is the author of several books, including \"Understanding Stocks,\" \"Understanding Options,\" and \"Help Your Child Build Wealth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: The AI boom is over - here's your bubble survival guide </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Michael Sincere </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

This echoes calls from other workers in the sector for fair wages and improved recruitment and retention to reduce understaffing issues.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“We work short so often that it’s more of a surprise to come in and find a full roster,” commented CUPE 4970 President Trina Walker. “Every day, we’re forced to make calls that prioritize only the bare necessities rather than providing the attention and care we want to offer our residents. We need that to change.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nUnderstaffing and working short is a prevalent issue in the long-term care sector, with just over 50% of Nova Scotian long term care homes meeting the bare minimum recommended 4.1 hours of care per day per resident. This recommendation is not mandatory, so long term care homes can, and do, fall below this number when staff are short due to lack of retention or illness.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“People keep saying that no one wants to work anymore. That’s not true.

The cost of everything has gone up dramatically in recent years, making the cost-of-living skyrocket, and wages just haven’t kept up. This isn’t a long-term care specific issue.
