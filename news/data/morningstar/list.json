I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Luckily, I did not mix our finances': My husband is 7 years younger and has dementia.

I have $140,000 in savings and about $260,000 in my retirement fund. I take in about $2,200 in monthly rent from four properties and will get about $700 in Social Security. All of my homes and vehicles are paid for and I have no debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If I retire next October, I will get about $3,600 a month in my retirement. If I work an extra year I'll get about $4,600 a month in my retirement. Taxes and insurance for all 4 homes comes out to be around $1,200 a month. I don't want to worry about money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Will it be OK to retire? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hopeful Retiree </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I'm planning to retire at 65 when my twins are 15. How will this impact their healthcare coverage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't have enough money for the kind of travel and leisure activities you would like to pursue in retirement, work for as long as you can. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Hopeful, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wait to retire and sell your rentals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's the short answer. But I have more to say, so buckle up. Your rentals bring in $1,000 a month after expenses and all the hassle of being a landlord on four separate properties. You're giving yourself a lot of work for a modest return. Let's say you sold your properties and made $500,000 and invested that in the S&amp;P 500 SPX; if you earned an average of 7% a year on that investment, you could still withdraw 4% a year ($20,000 annually or $1,667 a month), which would last you the next 30 years or more. It's a better return, although you don't have expenses to write off. But it's also less work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Waiting another year to retire is a no-brainer. You will get another $1,000 a month in your pension. But examine the fine balance between your income and expenses. You don't say what your annual expenses are now and/or will be in retirement, but it's probably safe to say you're close to exceeding them. The average spending for those aged 65 or older is roughly $4,345 monthly, according to RetireGuide.com. This covers housing, food, healthcare and entertainment. In their survey, nearly half spent under $2,000 monthly, a third spent $2,000-$3,999, and almost 20% spent over $3,999. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't have enough money for the kind of travel and leisure activities you would like to pursue in retirement, work for as long as you can, even part time. If you continue to work while receiving Social Security benefits, you will continue to pay Social Security tax. The age at which you \"break even\" - making it worthwhile to forego benefits for a larger sum at a later date - should not be the only basis for what you choose to do; your decision depends on a range of factors, including your longevity, income, marital status, and predictions for your cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Claiming Social Security </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For people like you who were born in 1960 or later, your full retirement age is 67. The earliest you can claim is 62, but you get reduced benefits; at that age, you get 36 months of delayed retirement credit, which increases every month past the full retirement age until you reach 70. (If you were born in 1957, your maximum retirement benefit would be 128% of your full retirement benefit at 70 years of age; this assumes FRA starts at 66 and 6 months. If you were born in 1955 and delay Social Security until age 70, you get 130.7%; your FRA is 66 and 2 months.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security is an insurance policy against living longer than you think. Of course, the best time to start taking Social Security is when you stop working. That's when you will need it the most. Some people will advise you to take your benefits at 67, pointing to all the things that can go wrong over the next 10 years, particularly with your health. If you are more optimistic, you're healthy and have \"good genes\" - that is, your parents lived to a long age - and you don't smoke or drink to excess, you may feel OK waiting until you are 70 and collecting roughly 24% more depending on your tax credits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm taking you at your word, and you say, \"I don't want to worry about money.\" If that is your guiding light, see these next few years as a gift and aim to reduce as much work-related stress as possible. You could, for example, start taking up some retirement-related activities now for a soft launch into retirement and/or ask your boss if you can work from home a couple of days a week (although this can be a controversial topic at some workplaces). The good news is, you can probably afford to retire next year if you really want to, but know that your decision will be hard to reverse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500': Do I sell my tech stocks before it's too late? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I think we've been lied to': Who exactly is considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm a veteran, 57, and on disability benefits.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Quest Insurance Group Limited</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best </strong>has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of B (Fair) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “bb+” (Fair) of Quest Insurance Group Limited (Quest) (New Zealand). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Quest’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as adequate, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings also factor in the neutral impact from the company’s ultimate majority shareholder, Federal Pacific Group Limited.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nQuest’s balance sheet strength assessment is underpinned by its risk-adjusted capitalisation, which was at the very strong level as of fiscal year-end (31 March) 2025, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Prospectively, AM Best expects the company’s risk-adjusted capitalisation to remain at least at the strong level, supported by internal capital generation. AM Best still expects the company’s regulatory solvency position to remain appropriate, supported by prudent capital management. Offsetting balance sheet strength factors include the company’s small absolute capital base of NZD 21.8 million, which increases the sensitivity of the risk-adjusted capitalisation to stress scenarios, such as outsized dividend payments or fluctuations in prospective performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses Quest’s operating performance as adequate, supported by its robust underwriting performance and positive investment returns. In fiscal year 2025, the company reported a combined ratio (net/net, IFRS 17) of 89.5% and a return-on-equity ratio of 23.6%. Quest’s investment income remains a stable contributor to its overall profits, with the company reporting a net investment yield (including gains/losses) of 4.5% in fiscal year 2025. AM Best expects prospective performance to remain supportive of the adequate assessment over the near term, although the company’s rapid business growth and risk profile changes could drive potential volatility.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nQuest’s business profile assessment of limited reflects its small market presence, geographic concentration and relatively niche product offering, largely as a provider of comprehensive vehicle insurance (CVI) and mechanical breakdown insurance (MBI) in New Zealand. The company’s scale of operation has increased significantly over the last five years, driven mostly by its third-party distributor of motor-related insurance. AM Best notes that Quest’s reliance on its third-party distributor has increased in recent years, with the related distribution channel accounting for over two-thirds of the gross premiums in fiscal-year 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses Quest’s ERM as appropriate given the current size and complexity of its operations. Nonetheless, AM Best expects continual development of Quest’s ERM capabilities to support its growing operations and risk profile. Following the conclusion of a recent regulatory investigation, Quest was issued a formal warning letter over potential contraventions of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010, with no penalties imposed. The company has since engaged in a process to strengthen its risk management capabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.
