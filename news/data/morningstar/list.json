The energy segment registered revenue of RM1.66 million compared to RM2.10 million previously, mainly attributable to seasonal monsoon conditions affecting generation output.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Despite mixed segmental movements, the Group posted a PBT of RM1.78 million compared to a loss before tax of RM1.42 million in Q1 FY2026.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  China's central bank has started taking steps to check the yuan's recent advance, dusting off an old playbook that would reduce the cost of betting against the currency. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The People's Bank of China announced it would slash the risk reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions conducting foreign-exchange forward trading to zero from 20%, a move that effectively makes purchasing the dollar cheaper. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The PBOC said change would take effect March 2 and reiterated its pledge to keep the yuan's exchange rate stable at a reasonable and balanced level. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Chinese yuan weakened after Friday's announcement, after strengthening for ten consecutive sessions to its highest levels against the greenback in nearly three years. The dollar gained roughly 0.1% against the onshore yuan to 6.86 yuan by midday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Chinese banks currently have to set aside a 20% risk reserve on forward currency trades. This \"speed bump\" was implemented in September 2022 when the yuan faced pressure to weaken from a surge in the dollar and a slowing Chinese economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While Beijing has recently signaled more tolerance for a stronger yuan, Chinese officials have also frequently warned against bumpy currency fluctuations that could hurt exporters. Authorities have recently restrained the yuan by setting the so-called daily fixings--guideposts for yuan trade which restricts it from moving more than 2% in either direction--at levels weaker than market expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The PBOC's reference rate for the dollar against yuan remained unchanged at 6.9228 on Friday, higher than a median estimate of 6.8435, according to Maybank. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"Along with the fix, it is clear that PBOC wants the yuan appreciation pace to slow\", said analysts at Maybank in a note. Many suggest that China has gained some leverage to do so from the yuan's rapid gains as well as the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturned the Trump administration's tariffs, they added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The PBOC has adjusted the requirement ratio on foreign-exchange forward trading several times over the past decade to manage the yuan. The requirement could be reimposed if concerns about the Chinese currency's appreciation abate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Singapore editors at singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"> \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 00:57 ET (05:57 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

The addition of these two highly experienced leaders will further strengthen the Board’s expertise, bringing outstanding regulatory knowledge and extensive CFO skills.

I very much look forward to collaborating with them on the Board.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs previously communicated, Lukas Gähwiler has decided, after an exceptionally successful career spanning 45 years, to retire from his role as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and concluding his long career in banking. He was appointed Vice Chairman in 2022 and acted as UBS’s representative within Switzerland’s leading trade associations and financial industry bodies.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'You could even retire at 55 with $500,000 and be perfectly fine. Am I right?' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Realistically, no one is going to spend $100,000 a year in retirement.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The money people need to save for retirement keeps going up, and I don't like it. I am also very skeptical. Some people say you need $5 million to retire; some say $1 million; others will give a figure anywhere in between. I am highly skeptical about these numbers and wonder what assumptions they're making about how you'll use your money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My grandpa retired at 70 after working as a missionary for most of his life and later at a national laboratory. He hardly earned anything as a missionary. Between his coffeehouse, wife and three kids, it all got spent. He made a lot of money at the lab, but only worked there for about 10 to 15 years before retiring. And now? He's a part-time programmer, landlord and fixes cars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since the goal of his life was not money, he retired with $750,000 - and he's doing fine. You know why? Because he bought two mobile homes some time ago, and a 2.5-acre lot in the middle of nowhere and started renting them before he retired. In addition to being a landlord, he also had some of his money invested in income stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He finds low-effort ways to make money. He buys an underpriced car, fixes it up, and resells it for a $1,000 profit. He used to run a programming company with my dad. They made a little money, but gained experience. That probably helped him get accepted at the laboratory. Some people even still ask him to reprogram things for them and pay him a few thousand dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Thrift shopping </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He also doesn't spend much. He doesn't own a luxury Tesla; he owns a $5,000 Prius. The only reason he spent more on a car was that my grandma really wanted one that actually worked. The rent from their garage covers their property tax. They don't eat out except on special occasions, like birthdays or holidays, and live a comfortable, low-cost life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They take a 30-minute walk every day to stay healthy. My grandma loves shopping a bit too much, but she shops at thrift stores, so their shopping and entertainment expenses remain low. So my grandpa doesn't receive much Social Security, but he makes it work because he uses his money wisely. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The American dream is to make six figures and buy a house. If you have $2.5 million in a money-market account with a 4% return, you get $100,000 a year. Realistically, no one is going to spend $100,000 a year in retirement. The average American spends $78,500 per year. That means, with no interest, $1 million would last about 12 years at that spending rate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Is the problem really how much money we have - or how much we spend? I daresay that if you put your money in the right places and you are careful, you could even retire at 55 with $500,000 and be perfectly fine. Am I right? Of course, it's good to enjoy the fruits of our labor and spend some money on leisure. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Am I missing something big, or were my suspicions right all along? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Skeptical Reader </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To take your retirement-at-55-with-$500,000 scenario at face value would be tough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Skeptical, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I am on #teamgrandpa. He's done a lot right. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He achieved three valuable things: He worked until he was 70. He found ways to make extra income, which includes renting his mobile homes for extra cash, and keeping his hand in freelance work for his former company, a job that was born from his willingness to take risks and experiment, and by using his assets to make money. And he keeps his costs low. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It would be tough to retire at 55 with $500,000, even though it's a lot of money, although it again depends on your lifestyle and where you live. You would have to take into account healthcare costs, utilities, transportation, rent/mortgage, and property tax.  You could also explore a substantially equal periodic payment plan (SEPP) or employ the Rule of 55. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It would be tough to retire at 55 with $500,000, even though it's a lot of money, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A reminder for readers out there: The \"rule of 55\" is an IRS provision that allows you to take penalty-free withdrawals from your current employer's 401(k) or 403(b) if you leave your job in the year you turn 55 - or later - without incurring a 10% early-withdrawal 10% penalty. SEPPs are IRS-approved, scheduled withdrawals from retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To take your retirement-at-55-with-$500,000 scenario at face value would be tough. That money, all going well with your health, would need to last 35-40 years and inflation would also erode its value over time. Using the 4% rule, that would provide $20,000 per year (or $1,670 per month), especially as Medicare eligibility does not kick in until 65. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your point about whether you need $1 million in retirement, as many surveys suggest - and also point out that $1 million is not enough - is well made. It all depends on your lifestyle, whether your income exceeds your expenses and how much you are willing to cut back in terms of all those extraneous expenses (from coffees and streaming services to eating out). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I'm 80 with $1 million. How do I prevent my son from being hit with inheritance tax? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Retiring at 65 with $1 million </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I have wondered in these pages whether people are squandering their retirement on eating out. All that pizza and spaghetti bolognese add up, as do the extras like drinks, side orders and desserts. Research suggests that people spend anywhere between $1,990 and $2,500 a year on restaurant food - and up to $3,640 on takeout. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In fact, Americans spend almost as much on dining out ($1.5 trillion a year) as they owe in student debt ($1.8 trillion), according to the Department of Agriculture. Total spending on food exceeds $2.63 trillion. Taking those dining-out figures at face value, you would spend $123,750 by 80 if you started counting at 25. Or over $200,000, including takeout. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans spend almost as much on dining out as they owe in student debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So, yes, I'm with your grandpa on this one. He pivoted from missionary work into the corporate sector and made enough money in the latter part of his working life to balance the books in retirement (otherwise known as \"making ends meet\"). That takes creativity, intelligence and gumption, and I'm sure your grandfather has those in spades. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other roadblocks and/or forks in the road people face in retirement, including a gradual decline in health, which could lead to the need to live in an assisted-living facility. That too costs money (up to $100,000 a year or more, depending on the facility and location). Without long-term-care insurance, retirees often tap the equity in their homes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saving, which requires curtailing your spending, is just as critical for a comfortable retirement as investing in a 401(k), IRA or taxable brokerage account. I'm a big fan of shopping at thrift stores. (I just bought a pair of Dr. Martens boots in New York to get me through the snowstorm.) The freedom to travel after 65, if you have the ability, is also a reward for retirement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A healthy retirement fund rewards you with that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Can I stop my kids from using their inheritance to support political causes I vehemently oppose? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My wife's credit-card payment is three months overdue.
