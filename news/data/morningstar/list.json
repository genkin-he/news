Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Lawrence G. McMillan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stay the course, but be cautious </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 index SPX gapped higher two days in a row this week - a show of strength. (Those gaps are marked with circles on the upper right of the SPX chart below.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's support now for SPX at the old highs - near 6,750 - in addition to the well-tested support at 6,500 to 6,550. Those support levels are marked with red horizontal lines on the SPX chart. It is possible that a pullback toward support at 6,750 could take place - SPX shed 1% on Thursday - but it would not be a game changer if it did. This market seems to be strong enough that it may not need such a pullback to \"refuel.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mind the gaps </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, about those S&amp;P 500 chart gaps: Some analysts believe most gaps need to be filled, and so a pullback toward support at 6,750 would do that. (Conversely, there are some obvious gaps that never get filled; witness the one back in April, also circled on the below chart.) What is almost comical, though, is the interpretations of two breakout gaps to new highs. Some view that as a sign of strength; to others, it's a sign of exhaustion. Frankly, you can probably prove whatever you want to as far as gaps are concerned. What is the important thing now is the 6,750 support level. If that is broken, it will be a large negative, and if support at 6,500 were broken, sellers would surely flood in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite the market's strength and the positive nature of the SPX chart, some indicators are showing weakness. So far, they have had little to no effect, but market tops can be \"rounding\" affairs with an accumulation of sell signals before a break occurs - as opposed to market bottoms, which can be sudden and V-shaped, such as the one back in April. To that end, SPX has not risen far enough to reach the +4&lt;SIGMA&gt; \"modified Bollinger band,\" so the McMillan volatility band (MVB) sell signal is still in place. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The equity-only put-call ratios curled upward and began to rise a little more than a week ago. That is normally a sell signal for the broad stock market, especially when these signals come from such a low level on their chart. But these sell signals have not been borne out with lower SPX prices, and now the put-call ratios are turning lower again. The computer programs we use to analyze these ratio charts continue to \"say\" that sell signals are in effect, but the look of it raises questions - marked by the question marks on the charts below. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another internal indicator - market breadth - has been struggling to stay positive, and certainly it is not as optimistic as the SPX chart. On the breakout itself by SPX, breadth was positive for a few days, and that was encouraging. However, over the past two days, breadth has weakened considerably, and the NYSE-based breadth oscillator is back to a sell signal, while the \"stocks only\" breadth oscillator is teetering on the brink of a new sell signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market breadth I am referring to here is the \"traditional\" breadth: the daily number of advancing issues minus the number of declining issues. Another type of breadth has been much more positive and in tune with the market: cumulative volume breadth (CVB), the daily accumulated total of volume on advancing stocks minus volume on declining stocks. CVB has been hitting all-time highs with some regularity, just like SPX. This past week, CVB made an all-time high on Oct. 24 and Oct. 27. This is strong confirmation of the new highs being made by SPX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Realized volatility, in the form of the 20-day historical volatility of SPX (HV20), has remained elevated ever since the market's last \"tariff tantrum\" on Oct. 10. This is a negative for stocks, too, in that a rise in volatility is generally not good for stock prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Implied volatility VIX had its moment, exploding to 29 in the first half of October. As dire as that seemed to be - and has been in the past - it amounted to nothing this time. VIX is back to about 17 now, almost as if nothing had happened. As a result, there are two buy signals in effect for the broad stock market: the \"spike peak\" buy signal (green \"B\" on the accompanying VIX chart) and the trend of VIX buy signal (pink \"B\" on the chart). As long as VIX remains below its 200-day moving average (currently just above 19), these buy signals will remain in effect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The construct of volatility derivatives is back to a fully bullish position for stocks as well. The term structures of both the VIX futures and of the Cboe volatility indices continue to slope upwards. Moreover, there is a relatively large premium on the VIX futures once again. So, despite the negativity associated with an inversion in the term structure during the week of Oct. 17, the market has recovered. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We remain overall bullish, in line with the SPX chart, but will continue to trade all confirmed signals when they appear. Continue to roll deeply in-the-money positions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earnings spotlight </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several important earnings reports are due next week, and while it's too early to price the straddles, one can observe the median move over the past 10 earnings reports: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir Technologies( PLTR): 17.8% of the stock price. If the straddle can be bought cheaper than that, there is an edge in favor of the straddle buy. (Earnings due Nov. 3 after the close of trading.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Uber Technologies (UBER): 5.7% of the stock price. (Earnings due Nov. 4 before the market opens.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Qualcomm (QCOM): 6.8% of the stock price. (Earnings due Nov. 5 after the close.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DraftKings (DKNG): 4.4% of the stock price (Earnings due Nov. 6 after the close.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New recommendation: ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When the premium is large on the VIX futures, the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF SVXY rises in value. The reason is that this ETF is short the actual VIX futures. When there is a large premium on those futures, there is \"time decay\" as time passes, and the futures lose value, all else being equal. Of course, a rising VIX would cause SVXY to fall in value even if the futures retained a premium. Generally, though, when the futures premium is large, it can be beneficial to own SVXY or buy calls on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buy 4 SVXY (Nov. 21) 50 calls in line with the market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We compute a weighted futures premium composite, and we call that calculation VOLFUTA. It currently stands at 2.30. This trade would be stopped out if it were to fall to 0.50 or less. We will update its value weekly in this report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New recommendation: Whirlpool (WHR) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a new weighted put-call-ratio buy signal in Whirlpool (WHR). The company reported earnings this week and the stock enjoyed a brief rally, which has mostly dissipated. Regardless, the previous put-call-ratio buy signal from a roughly equivalent level last June worked out well, so we are recommending this one now - although we are putting a condition on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If WHR closes above 75, then buy 2 WHR (Dec. 19) 75 calls in line with the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Follow-up action: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We are using a standard rolling procedure for our SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) SPY spreads: In any vertical bull or bear spread, if the underlying hits the short strike, then roll the entire spread. That would be roll up in the case of a call bull spread or roll down in the case of a bear put spread. Stay in the same expiration and keep the distance between the strikes the same unless otherwise instructed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, for outright long options, roll if they become 8 points in-the-money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 APH (APH) (Nov. 21) 130 calls: The stock is making new highs. Raise the trailing closing stop for APH to 128 for these calls. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 TSEM (TSEM) (Nov. 17) 75 call and short 1 TSEM (Nov. 21) 85 call: Raise the trailing, closing stop to 72 for this TSEM spread. Roll the entire spread up 10 points if TSEM trades at 85. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long expiring 1 SPY (Oct. 31) 687 call and sell 1 SPY (Oct. 31) 702 call: The spread was rolled up when SPY traded at 687 on Oct. 28. Now, roll to the following: Buy 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 685 call and sell 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 705 call. We will hold until new lows outnumber new highs on two consecutive days on the NYSE. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 4 ATAI (ATAI) (Nov. 21) 6 calls: Use a trailing closing stop at 5.20 for these calls. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 NKE (NKE) (Nov. 21) 72.5 puts: We will hold these as long as the weighted put-call ratio for NKE is on a sell signal. Roll down to the NKE (Nov. 21) 65 puts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 665 put and short 1 SPY (Nov. 21) 615 put: This is the position based on the MVB sell signal. Continue to hold until SPX trades at either of the +/-4&lt;SIGMA&gt; bands. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 BXP (BXP) (Jan. 16) 72.5 puts: We will hold this position as long as the weighted put-call ratio for BXP remains on a sell signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 400 BEEM (BEEM) common: Use a trailing, closing stop at 2.75 for this position. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 SPY (Nov. 28) 685 call and short 1 SPY (Nov. 28) 700 call: This is the position based on the most recent VIX \"spike peak\" buy signal. Stop out if VIX closes above 28.99 on any day. Otherwise, we will hold for 22 trading days. The original spread was rolled up when SPY traded at 685 on Oct. 28. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 2 BSX (BSX) (Dec. 19) 100 calls: We will hold these calls as long as the weighted put-call ratio for BSX remains on a buy signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Send questions to: lmcmillan@optionstrategist.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lawrence G.

(“Avantor” or the “Company”) (NYSE: AVTR) and reminds investors of the <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">December 29, 2025 deadline</strong> to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFaruqi &amp; Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.faruqilaw.com%2F&amp;esheet=54348505&amp;newsitemid=20251030523913&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.faruqilaw.com&amp;index=5&amp;md5=b85b5e7ad9884d9564a88ac774b65adf\" tabindex=\"0\">www.faruqilaw.com</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Avantor’s competitive positioning was weaker than Defendants had publicly represented; (2) Avantor was experiencing negative effects from increased competition; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ representations about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDuring the Class Period, Defendants misled investors by falsely touting the Company’s competitive positioning and downplaying the effects of increased competition. For example, during an earnings call on July 26, 2024, in response to an analyst’s question about whether Avantor was losing share to a competitor, Defendant Michael Stubblefield, then the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, assured investors that Avantor’s “lab business stacks up well against every number that certainly that we’ve seen,” that “we continue to enhance our position,” and that “we’re really confident in our value proposition and our competitive position.” Likewise, Defendants repeatedly pointed to Avantor’s purported competitive advantages, such as its digital capabilities, as evidence that the Company would continue to enjoy strong competitive positioning.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nInvestors began to learn the truth about the effects of increased competition on Avantor’s business on April 25, 2025, when the Company reported disappointing first quarter 2025 financial results, cut its guidance for 2025, and announced that Defendant Stubblefield would be stepping down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer. Defendants attributed Avantor’s weak performance and outlook to “the impact of increased competitive intensity.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOn this news, the price of Avantor common stock declined $2.57 per share, or more than 16.5%, from a close of $15.50 per share on April 24, 2025, to close at $12.93 per share on April 25, 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThen, on August 1, 2025, the Company reported disappointing second quarter 2025 financial results, including a year-over-year decrease in net sales, and further reduced the Company’s 2025 guidance—now projecting organic revenue growth of -2% to 0%. Defendants again attributed Avantor’s poor results and outlook to “increased competitive intensity,” and further admitted that the Company did not expect the competitive environment to materially improve in the remainder of 2025 and weak performance would therefore likely persist.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIn response to this news, the price of Avantor common stock declined $2.08 per share, or more than 15%, from a close of $13.44 per share on July 31, 2025, to close at $11.36 per share on August 1, 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThen, on October 29, 2025, the Company reported weak third quarter 2025 financial results, including -5% organic revenue growth (below the guidance Defendants had provided in August), and a net loss of $712 million, which Defendants primarily attributed to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $785 million. Defendants revealed that the impairment charge was necessary due in part to “competitive pressures” that had “meaningfully impacted” the Company’s margins, and further admitted that the Company had lost several large accounts.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOn this news, the price of Avantor common stock declined $3.50 per share, or more than 23%, from a close of $15.08 per share on October 28, 2025, to close at $11.58 per share on October 29, 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFaruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Avantor’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nTo learn more about the <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Avantor</strong> class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faruqilaw.com%2Fcase%2Favantor-inc%2F&amp;esheet=54348505&amp;newsitemid=20251030523913&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.faruqilaw.com%2Fcase%2Favantor-inc%2F&amp;index=6&amp;md5=f703f9c7f9b099da27290c1a6a0fe3ce\" tabindex=\"0\">www.faruqilaw.com/case/avantor-inc/</a> or <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">call</strong> Faruqi &amp; Faruqi partner <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Josh Wilson directly </strong>at <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">877-247-4292 </strong>or <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310)</strong>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFollow us for updates on <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Ffaruqi-%26-faruqi-llp%2F&amp;esheet=54348505&amp;newsitemid=20251030523913&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=LinkedIn&amp;index=7&amp;md5=41fba7a66eb8f7a91558642dfc6a6547\" tabindex=\"0\">LinkedIn</a>, on <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Ffaruqilaw&amp;esheet=54348505&amp;newsitemid=20251030523913&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=X&amp;index=8&amp;md5=81d6cd1e86926ba053b012332a912561\" tabindex=\"0\">X</a>, or on <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FFaruqiLaw%2F&amp;esheet=54348505&amp;newsitemid=20251030523913&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Facebook&amp;index=9&amp;md5=1fffa92d5ad108b37753348177cb2bdd\" tabindex=\"0\">Facebook</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAttorney Advertising.
