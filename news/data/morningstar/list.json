Physically, he is not able to live independently, but was or is pretty sharp mentally. We take care of all his bills; his house and car were sold over three years ago. His wife died in 2020; they had no children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 10 days, he started calling my sister about bills he needed to pay; all his bills are being paid by her. He also wants to know the balance in his bank accounts. My sister has always given him this information when he asks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He wanted to see the lawyer recently. He was very paranoid, asking staff to witness their conversation. He doesn't remember that he sold his house or car. In an email, his lawyer said, \"He's gone off the deep end.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lawyer's last words to us were we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate. My sister and I are his only family, the will is made and we would inherit his estate. What do we do next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Other Sibling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Sibling, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not encouraged by the tone or content of his attorney's email. It lacks compassion, professionalism and respect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother is confused and needs help. But he doesn't need an executor. An executor is appointed by the probate court after your brother passes away (and would typically be designated executor in his will). A power of attorney usually looks after a person's finances while they have diminished capacity; a durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. A conservator/guardian would be appointed by the courts to oversee his financial, physical and medical wellbeing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Take immediate steps to safeguard your brother's safety: He may need an assessment for dementia or cognitive impairment from a neurologist or geriatrician. I hope that the assisted-living facility is aware of this change of behavior, and is equipped to help him navigate this next stage. You will all need to work together until you figure out the next steps for your brother. Questions remain: What kind of power of attorney document currently exists? What legal capacity does your brother have to make decisions for himself - everything from hiring a new lawyer to revoking a POA? Has your brother been actually diagnosed with dementia? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, you will require health advocates and a competent lawyer. If the lawyer mentioned in your letter is not equipped to deal with your brother's situation - and it could be so given his reaction to the decline in your brother's health - you need a new lawyer to oversee your brother's affairs; as his joint powers of attorney, you can help him to appoint one. They will be able to help outline your options, which will depend on what kind of POA you hold and whether or not your brother requires conservatorship/guardianship, which should be a last resort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Laws regarding a conservator/guardian vary by state. In Texas, you would need to file a petition with the court. \"A hearing will be held, and the judge will examine the evidence and make a decision,\" says Childs Legacy Law Firm in Houston. \"In the second instance, absent a pending petition, and in lieu of a family member, living will or another relevant document, the court will appoint a conservator. The conservator can be any number of people, like a friend, social worker, neighbor, church member, attorney, nurse [or] another qualified person.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     General conservatorship </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A general conservatorship is created when an adult - typically an elderly person but can be a younger adult person - cannot manage their finances or health due to deteriorated mental capacity or impairment caused by an illness or injury,\" it adds. \"While they recover from the illness or injury, a conservator may be appointed by a court to address their medical and financial needs.\" Reasons include a person falling into a coma, a form of dementia like Alzheimer's, head injury or a stroke that impairs their ability to think or express their wishes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating, quite suddenly. \"People who suffer from any of the above can become vulnerable to bad actors who may try to manipulate the situation for their own financial gain. These bad actors may, for example, attempt to divert your disability payments (fraud) or coerce you into changing a will (undue influence),\" the law firm says. It is always better to draft an estate plan while you have the legal capacity to write and sign such a document. Otherwise, it will be left up to the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating. He needs calm and legal protection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, your brother needs reassurance and validation, clear and comforting communication, a routine so he feels safe, and legal protection; document everything, especially his changes in behavior. If he does not already have a healthcare proxy or healthcare power of attorney, and your brother is not of sound mind, the courts will appoint one for him. If he is in assisted living, for example, there may come a time when you will have to move him to a full-time care facility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the absence of long-term-care insurance or Medicaid, I assume you will use (or have used) the proceeds from the sale of his house to pay for his care. Selling a primary residence turns the home's equity from an exempt asset into countable cash, which often exceeds the strict monthly $2,000-$3,000 individual limit for Medicaid, which would lead to a temporary loss of benefits until those funds are spent. A trust and estate attorney can talk through your options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can do this. But you can't - nor should you - do it alone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am fearful': My ailing relative is being forced into assisted living.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Andrew Keshner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The case goes back decades. It's a cautionary tale about choosing a tax preparer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A woman who inadvertently hired a crooked accountant is down to her last shot in court to fight a massive tax bill. Her story is a reminder that the IRS can come after taxpayers decades later - even if they didn't know their tax preparer was doing anything illegal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About three decades ago, an accountant profited from dubious deductions he put on the tax returns of an unsuspecting client. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now the client could owe the IRS more than $328,000 in taxes, penalties and interest for crimes her tax preparer committed using her and others - and she's down to her last shot at avoiding the bill. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The client, Stephanie Murrin, is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear her case after two lower courts sided with the Internal Revenue Service. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Murrin did not intend to evade taxes when she hired the accountant to prepare her return back in 1993, government lawyers have acknowledged. Nevertheless, she could still be on the hook for her accountant's fraudulent actions, they say. In recent years, IRS criminal investigators have launched an increasing number of probes into questionable refunds in cases similar to Murrin's. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Murrin's lawyers say she shouldn't be forced to pay, according to a petition they filed last week. The stakes are high for her and anyone else who may be unaware that their tax preparer cut corners or committed fraud - even if it happened decades ago, the court papers said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Those taxpayers are left to defend their tax returns when the government suddenly appears unannounced, out of nowhere, asserting massive tax liabilities from decades earlier,\" the filing said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"And the insult added to that injury is an innocent party's financial life can be turned upside down based on someone else's fraud - conducted in the far-off past and entirely unbeknownst to the law-abiding party.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Taxpayers are left to defend their tax returns when the government suddenly appears unannounced, out of nowhere, asserting massive tax liabilities from decades earlier.' Stephanie Murrin's Supreme Court petition for a writ of certiorari </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Murrin is fighting her case, many people left in a jam by their tax preparer just pay the IRS and try to get on with their life, said Nina Olson, the former IRS national taxpayer advocate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Murrin's case highlights pitfalls that lurk when people entrust someone with their taxes, according to Olson. \"They don't have a way to know if this preparer is better or more competent than another preparer,\" Olson told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In fact, most people paid to handle tax returns are not lawyers, accountants or enrolled agents, according to a watchdog report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office released this week. This exposes taxpayers to errors and consequences from uncredentialed preparers - and these preparers are generally not subject to IRS regulation, the report said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A bipartisan bill released Thursday would toughen penalties against preparers who improperly handle returns. It would also protect their clients from being audited years later because of their preparer's fraud. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The IRS and an attorney for Murrin declined to comment on the case. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How Murrin ended up staring at a six-figure tax bill </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Court papers don't specify how Murrin and her then husband came into contact with the accountant - but the man already had a troubled past by that time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Duane Howell began preparing the Murrins' returns in 1993, his accountant's license had already been suspended after a 1986 conviction in New York federal court for preparing fraudulent tax returns. The Murrins didn't know about Howell's history, and they used his services through 1999. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In 2006, New York federal prosecutors indicted Howell and his employee. Howell and his worker, then based in Palm Beach, Fla., had inflated their clients' write-offs and fabricated expenses for years, prosecutors alleged in the indictment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The moves lowered the clients' taxable income and increased the size of their tax refunds. The pair charged their clients fees for all the extra paperwork and sometimes took one-third of a client's refund payment as compensation, according to the indictment. Howell omitted his name from his clients' tax returns and listed different \"preparer\" entities in an attempt to avoid IRS scrutiny, according to court filings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All in, Howell and his employee generated approximately $10 million in fraudulent expenses and deductions, according to prosecutors. The scores of questionable tax returns were filed between 1992 and 2003. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Howell, then age 72, pleaded guilty to two charges including conspiracy to commit tax fraud. He  spent just over a year in prison starting in 2009, according to court and prison records. The outcome included a court order to pay $1.2 million in restitution to the IRS. Efforts to reach Howell or his attorneys were unsuccessful. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not clear when Murrin learned of Howell's conviction, but it could have been in 2019. That's when the IRS told her she owed more than $65,000 in unpaid taxes and around $13,000 in penalties for filing inaccurate returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On top of that, the IRS said Murrin - like anyone with an unpaid tax bill or penalty - would have to pay interest on the money she owed. The years of interest piling up on the owed taxes and penalties could amount to an estimated $250,000, according to Murrin's court papers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Why did so much time pass before the IRS came looking? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The IRS generally has three years to inspect a return for accuracy once it's been filed. But the agency can dig into a tax return at any time if a false or fraudulent tax return was filed \"with the intent to evade tax,\" according to the tax code. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Murrin's lawyers say the IRS only has the right to look into her return if she was the one who intended to evade tax, and they say that's not the case. Their client \"acted in good faith and did not know about, let alone cause any false entries on any of the returns,\" they wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But government lawyers say the tax code never spelled out whose \"intent to evade\" matters. Therefore, the IRS bill was on solid legal ground, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia upheld a tax court judgment against Murrin last fall. The three-judge panel said it understood Murrin's \"frustration\" over facing a hefty bill \"due to the wrongdoing of someone other than her. But we are bound by statute.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lower-court ruling in Murrin's case effectively forces anyone who has used a tax preparer to keep all their tax records forever, just in case the IRS comes knocking years - or decades - later, said Bryan Camp, a professor at the Texas Tech University School of Law. Camp filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court of appeals to side with Murrin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The IRS has traditionally had the burden of showing that a taxpayer intended to dodge taxes, but decisions over the past 20 years have put more pressure on taxpayers to defend themselves against audits of long-ago returns, according to his brief. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This puts victimized taxpayers in a bind, Camp told MarketWatch. When the Justice Department and the IRS go after unscrupulous preparers, they often obtain plea deals in exchange for the preparer's cooperation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now the IRS has that bludgeon, that cudgel, to whack a taxpayer with. Now it's up to the taxpayer to prove it wasn't fraud, and that's just backwards,\" Camp said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Government attorneys have defended their approach in Murrin's case and others. \"There is nothing nefarious\" about the IRS taking time to build solid cases to find and collect owed tax money, federal attorneys told the circuit-court judges. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n      'There is nothing nefarious' about the IRS taking time to build cases to collect owed taxes, government lawyers said in court papers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Murrin hasn't paid the bill yet. Now she's hoping the Supreme Court will intervene. If they take her case, the justices will decide whether the fraudulent acts of a third-party tax preparer should expose unknowing clients to audits that could reach years into the past. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How to steer clear of shady tax preparers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whatever the high court does, Murrin's case is a cautionary tale for taxpayers as they file their 2025 income-tax returns. Last year, IRS criminal investigators launched 127 probes, most of which were referred to prosecutors. That was up from 93 investigations in 2023, according to statistics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The IRS's criminal-investigation wing routinely tells tax filers to beware of preparers who promise big refunds or take a cut of their clients' refunds as payment. Trustworthy tax professionals will put their preparer tax identification number on a client's return and also provide a copy of the return for the filer's records, the IRS said in a bulletin about tax fraud. Another red flag is being asked to sign a blank tax return, it added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Tax fraud harms you and your community. It can lead to civil or criminal charges, put your money and personal information at risk, and reduce funding for essential community services,\" the bulletin said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What personal-finance issues would you like to see covered in MarketWatch?

Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were down about 6% each. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV) were down more than 3% even as analysts at Cowen raised their rating on the stock to buy on Friday and praised the industry's backdrop. Such ratings changes usually provide a boost for a company's shares. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil futures jumped on Friday after nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva ended with no concrete agreements. Negotiations are set to resume next week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many airlines shield themselves from volatility in the price of fuel, which makes up a large part of their operational costs, by hedging it, usually using financial derivatives to try to spread their risk. But there has been a clear negative correlation between oil futures prices and airline stocks in recent years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Signs that inflation may persist and broader fears about artificial intelligence and tech stocks were also at play for U.S. equities, with some fearing that March will be another tumultuous month for the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. airlines enjoy broad-based demand and capacity is \"rational,\" the Cowen analysts said in their note about Southwest. The \"rising industry tide\" bodes well for the company, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The airline for years stuck with a one-size-fits-all approach that fell out of sync with competitors, which dove deeper into tiered fares and charging for different services as a way to drum up more profits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amid pressure from activist investors, Southwest announced sweeping changes a couple of years ago, including the end of its hallmark policies of open seating and no fees for checked baggage. It started charging baggage fees earlier this year, while extra-legroom and assigned-seating options went live in January. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -CLAUDIA ASSIS </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
