Recalling a time when \"China was still catching up with the rest of the world,\" Khan said he is struck by the \"consistency of effort\" seen today. \"People work hard and they also cherish family, tradition and festivals,\" he said. \"There's a balance between ambition and humanity.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For Khan, China is a living model where \"science serves society, innovation lifts communities, and progress is measured not just in patents or GDP, but in human dignity.\" \"That's the beauty of China,\" he remarked.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Foreign experts framed their expectations for the upcoming Two Sessions within this broader context of balanced and human-centric development. They anticipate that the policies discussed will not only drive technological breakthroughs but also institutionalize the open ecosystems and sustainable practices that allow this unique \"Chinese model\" to flourish and contribute globally.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Francesco Faiola, an Italian researcher at the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has spent 12 years in China, witnessing its transformation from \"a phase of rapid catch-up to one characterized by systematic innovation.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">His expectations are built upon this solid foundation. He said recent policies focus on regional integration initiatives like the coordinated development of the \"Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei\" region and \"Yangtze River Delta,\" signaling China's clear intention to build collaborative innovation ecosystems rather than isolated \"peaks\" of scientific excellence.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">He welcomed the ongoing establishment of an open governance framework grounded in clear rules. \"Clear rules inspire far greater confidence for long-term collaboration than ambiguous discretion,\" Faiola said.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Regarding the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030), Faiola observed that China's commitment to international collaboration is evolving from \"one-way introduction\" to a deeper model of \"two-way exchange\" and \"joint ecosystem building.\" Chinese scientists are already taking a leading role in global discussions on ethical standards for stem cell research, marking a shift from \"participant\" to \"contributor.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Building on this positive momentum, Faiola anticipates continued empowerment for major international scientific programs jointly led by Chinese and foreign teams. Citing global research on emerging pollutants as a prime example, he said such collaborations will significantly enhance China's growing influence in shaping the global scientific agenda.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Confident in the ecosystem's current vitality, Faiola highlighted its proven ability to provide a complete pathway \"from curiosity-driven research to real-world impact,\" empowering global talent to translate discoveries into solutions for shared human challenges.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Extending this vision of systemic strength to the critical field of sustainability, Muhammad Salman Nasir, a 37-year-old Pakistani scholar and associate professor at Tianjin University, said China is already \"playing a pivotal role in advancing global carbon neutrality.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Nasir highlighted China's key strength: its ability to \"integrate national policy with academic and industrial innovation, enabling rapid scaling of technologies like green hydrogen, solar fuels, and carbon capture.\" He described China's research system, marked by strategic funding, interdisciplinary collaboration, and effective pilot-to-industry pathways, as a valuable model for other nations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Regarding the 15th Five-Year Plan, Nasir expressed confidence that proposals for building a new energy system and developing a circular economy will further reinforce these strengths, enabling China to continue leading global efforts in sustainable technological innovations and offering a replicable blueprint for the world's green transition.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The perspectives of the three experts illustrate a comprehensive expectation that the Two Sessions will not only refine the mechanisms of scientific collaboration and green development but also continue to foster the unique harmony that makes China's path to modernization so distinct.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"> </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN97645&amp;sd=2026-02-28\"/></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foreign-experts-chinas-innovation-ecosystem-to-benefit-the-world-302700151.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foreign-experts-chinas-innovation-ecosystem-to-benefit-the-world-302700151.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Science and Technology Daily</p></span>\n</div>",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 7, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Paysafe's ecommerce business had significant exposure to a single high risk client; (2) as a result, Paysafe's credit loss reserves and/or write-offs were understated; (3) Paysafe had an undisclosed issue with higher risk Merchant Category Codes, making its client services difficult to bank; (4) the foregoing issues were likely to have a material negative impact on Paysafe's revenue growth and overall revenue mix; (5) as a result, Paysafe was unlikely to meet its own previously issued financial guidance for fiscal year 2025; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Paysafe's  business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Paysafe class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629775-1&amp;h=1900287557&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D2745&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D2745\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=2745</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.
