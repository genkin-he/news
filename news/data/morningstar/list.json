Moreover, the Company reported its Design IP segment accounted for approximately 25% of revenue and came in at $426.6 million, a 7.7% decline year-over-year.

Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) the extent to which the Company’s increased focus on artificial intelligence customers, which require additional customization, was deteriorating the economics of its Design IP business; (2) that, as a result, “certain road map and resource decisions” were unlikely to “yield their intended results;” (3) that the foregoing had a material negative impact on financial results; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Synopsys securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">60 days from the date of this notice</strong> to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Contact Us To Participate or Learn More:</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact us:\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nCharles Linehan, Esq.,\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Glancy Prongay &amp;

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment, until they are 18.\" (Photo subjects are models.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm thinking of retiring at 65, when my twins will be 15. I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I'm in the home stretch': I'm 80.

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections about future events and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “may”, “should”, “could”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “expect”, “believe” or “continue”, or the negative thereof or similar variations. Forward-looking statements in this news release include statements regarding the Company’s intended use of proceeds, the Company’s prepayment of the High Trail convertible debenture, and the Company’s ability to address the need for new and innovative treatment options for people who suffer from mental health conditions.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThese forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates of management of the Company at the time such statements were made.
