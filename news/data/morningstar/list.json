The step supports the company's efforts to enhance energy supply security and grid reliability in line with the objectives of Vision 2030.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Eng. Khalid Al-Ghamdi, Chief Executive Officer of Saudi Energy, said the transformation builds on financial, regulatory and structural reforms implemented in the electricity sector since 2020 under the Ministerial Committee for the Restructuring of the Electricity Sector, chaired by HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Minister of Energy, to achieve the sector's objectives and improve service quality for consumers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Al-Ghamdi emphasized that the new identity draws on the company's established legacy, marks a new chapter in its journey, and represents an evolution in role and responsibility rather than a change in its core business.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">He noted that the launch constitutes a strategic step toward reinforcing a modern institutional image grounded in trust, sustainability and future readiness, reaffirming Saudi Energy's commitment to supporting the energy sector and contributing to sustainable growth and prosperity across the Kingdom.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"We are building on a strong legacy in the electricity sector and moving forward with an identity that reflects our readiness for a more integrated phase.

This includes enhancing sector reliability and efficiency by achieving an optimal electricity generation mix, displacing liquid fuels to strengthen supply security, modernizing, automating and expanding transmission and distribution networks, increasing localization, attracting investment, and advancing the Kingdom's environmental objectives.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">It added that the launch of the new identity builds on the company's long-standing national legacy in supplying electricity across the Kingdom and reinforces its position as a key enabler of electrical infrastructure. It also highlights its central role in enhancing grid reliability, modernizing and automating its infrastructure, and supporting the integration of energy sources, contributing to system stability and long-term energy security. The evolution continues under the existing regulatory framework governing the company's licensed activities across generation, transmission, distribution, storage and power system enablement, ensuring continuity in its operating model and governance structure.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The company said that under its new identity, Saudi Energy places customer centricity at the core of its operating strategy, embodied in its corporate promise, \"Around you, for you.\" It added that it remains committed to enhancing customer experience, strengthening service quality, advancing digital engagement channels and responding effectively to the needs of individuals, businesses and industrial sectors, contributing to improved quality of life and economic competitiveness.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The company added that the transformation further aligns Saudi Energy with international best practices in managing and operating energy networks and critical infrastructure, strengthening operational efficiency and reinforcing its role as a key enabler of electrical infrastructure, while supporting the Kingdom's broader positioning as a global energy hub.</p><span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Restricted - مقيد</p></span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Contact Information:</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Saudi Energy</strong><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">966920001100</strong><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:933@se.com.sa\" tabindex=\"0\">933@se.com.sa</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">SOURCE:</strong> Saudi Electricity Company</p><br/><br/>View the original <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/oil-gas-and-energy/saudi-electricity-company-launches-new-corporate-identity-rebrands-as-saudi-ener-1141551\" tabindex=\"0\">press release</a> on ACCESS Newswire<br/><br/>\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--0-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:0;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/img.ashx?id=1141551\"/></picture></span></div>",

Mobile clinics are a trusted, cost-effective way to deliver that kind of care — but too often, outdated regulations and payment models get in the way.

The movement higher doesn't appear supported by fundamentals, said Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note. \"We are still looking for that elusive fundamental reason why wheat is hanging in around its highs after a 49-cent rally since the beginning of the calendar year,\" says Sernatinger. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Summit Squabble: A story from the South China Morning Post said the potential summit between President Trump and Chinese president Xi is experiencing issues, which the story attributes to \"planning gaps and weak coordination on the U.S. side.\" The story was a pressure point for soybeans Thursday,  as well as livestock futures, due to the export demand from those products coming from China. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Always in the Background: Analysts are keeping a close eye on how the Brazilian harvest is progressing, and preparing for the surge of Brazilian soybeans hitting the global export market. The record amount of soybeans expected from Brazil may create a short-term ceiling for prices. \"It would be unusual for the biggest soybean harvest the world has ever seen (Brazil) to not slow down price gains in the beans at some point,\" said Doug Bergman of RCM Alternatives in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Missing the Mark: Export sales of U.S. corn fell below the expectations of analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this week. The USDA said Thursday that corn export sales across the 2025/26 and 2026/27 marketing years totaled 697,500 metric tons for the week ended Feb. 19. Analysts had forecast sales to land between 900,000 tons and 1.8 million tons. Soybean and wheat sales landed on the low end of analyst expectations for the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  New Sale: The USDA said this morning that 178,000 metric tons of corn were sold to Japan, with 154,000 tons for delivery during the 2026/2027 marketing year and an additional 24,000 tons for 2027/28 delivery. While the market welcomes flash sales, Thursday's notice isn't the one many traders were hoping to see -  that would be a sale of soybeans to China, which was rumored among market participants this week. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Agricultural Prices report at 3 p.m. ET Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The CFTC will release its weekly Commitment of Traders report at 3:30 p.m. ET Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its weekly Grain Export Inspections report at 11 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Grain Crushings report at 3 p.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 15:25 ET (20:25 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

Stores are reporting a 50% - 70% increase in self-checkout transactions. A defining feature of ELERA® Security Suite that is critical for the retailer includes accurately recognizing over 700 unique produce codes and a wide assortment of fresh produce. The solution is also reducing staff self-checkout intervention rates from 50% to about 10%—20%. By spending less time at self-checkout, employees are empowered to focus on higher-value responsibilities around the store.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“The self-checkout improvements provided by Toshiba and ELERA® Security Suite are especially significant on high-traffic days when produce promotions attract more shoppers. My team and I can provide better customer service when we can work efficiently and with less stress during peak hours,” said Adriana Correa, Store Manager at Hipermarket El Dorado, a chain under Group El Rosado. “When fewer team members are at self-checkout, our staff can focus on other operational tasks and increase overall productivity across the store.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWith the rollout completed in less than four months, the rapid successful pilot implementation is a testament to the strong collaboration between Grupo El Rosado, Toshiba, and valued partners. <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compuhelp.com.ec%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=COMPUHELP&amp;index=5&amp;md5=89993f28afd40b7a9d421495b611cb16\" tabindex=\"0\">COMPUHELP</a> performed the installation, and systems integrator <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F33sur.cl%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=33%26%23176%3B+Sur&amp;index=6&amp;md5=fe0ddf1a73599fff108b002e7ad77f17\" tabindex=\"0\">33° Sur</a> was responsible for the seamless implementation.
