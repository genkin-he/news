Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. At the time Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547069-1&amp;h=2013038123&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm</a>, on Twitter: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547069-1&amp;h=1301859455&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://twitter.com/rosen_firm</a> or on Facebook: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547069-1&amp;h=3181757778&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Attorney Advertising.

The update follows Onco-Innovations' CEO Thomas O'Shaughnessy's recent appearance on Cboe Canada's Investor Spotlight (October 22, 2025), where he discussed Onco's mission to enhance cancer treatment technologies through innovation, AI-driven research, and strategic growth initiatives.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Over the past several months, Onco has achieved a series of milestones that have strengthened its scientific and operational foundation, including: acquiring Inka Health AI in February 2025, moving its stock listing to the Cboe Canada Market, partnering with Dalton Pharma Services in May 2025, entering into continued collaboration with the University of Alberta and the Cross Cancer Institute in June 2025, signing an agreement with Nucro-Technics in July 2025 and entering into a start-up agreement with Avance Clinical Pty Ltd, all furthering Onco's research and development efforts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Building on the progress achieved throughout 2025, Onco is now focused on advancing its programs toward clinical evaluation and strengthening its position in the capital markets. The Company continues to lay the groundwork for a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2026, which would mark a transition from preclinical research and testing to clinical translation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In the Cboe Spotlight interview, Mr. O'Shaughnessy reflected upon the Company's intention to pursue a U.S. strategy that focuses on enhancing the Company's U.S. presence, including through the pursuit of a U.S. stock exchange cross-listing in 2026. The Company believes that a cross-listing could enhance shareholder value by expanding access to a wider base of potential institutional and retail investors. Additionally, the greater exposure to U.S. capital markets generally would be expected to strengthen engagement with the North American research and development community, supporting Onco's long-term growth trajectory.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">The groundwork we have laid over the past several months has positioned us to move decisively into clinical development. We are now entering an exciting phase where our focus evolves from preclinical success to preparing for clinical validation. Our near-term priorities include completing the necessary steps for our first-in-human trial and advancing our U.S. strategy, both of which will be key drivers of our next stage of growth,</em>\" stated Thomas O'Shaughnessy, CEO of Onco-Innovations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Onco-Innovations Limited</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Onco-Innovations is a Canadian-based company dedicated to cancer research and treatment, specializing in oncology.
