Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $8.71 billion in revenue, which would translate to about 16% growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That comes after Chief Executive Michael Miebach used Mastercard's earnings release to call out robust spending from both consumers and businesses, which helped the company post 9% growth in gross dollar volume for its third quarter and 10% growth in purchase volume. Those both matched rates seen in the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Across different segments of the population, whether it's affluent or mass market, we're seeing good healthy trends,\" Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra added in a conversation with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Visa Inc. (V) also pointed to consumer \"resilience\" when it delivered its numbers earlier this week. On Visa's earnings call, executives highlighted \"relatively consistent\" growth among different income bands, \"with the highest-spend band continuing to grow the fastest.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Visa earnings offer an upbeat read on consumer-spending habits </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That Visa and Mastercard are humming along while cracks show up in some pockets of the economy underscores the high-level nature of these businesses. As Visa pointed out earlier this week, the company is broadly exposed to debit and credit trends; so is Mastercard. That means the companies are relatively insulated from trends like consumers trading down to lower-priced products, as long as customers keep spending in aggregate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers \"might make choices as to how they spend, but the size of the wallet that they're spending is what we get to see,\" Mastercard's Mehra said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Fiserv's stock plunges 40% on worst day ever. Outlook reset is deemed 'difficult to comprehend.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the third quarter, that spending helped drive $8.6 billion in revenue for Mastercard, a hair above the FactSet analyst consensus of $8.54 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.38, while analysts had been modeling $4.32. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mastercard benefits from its faster-growth services business that consists of fraud products, research insights and other value-add offerings for financial-services customers. Services revenue was up 25% in the third quarter, outpacing the 17% revenue growth seen for the overall business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Artificial intelligence could be a further tailwind to the services business, and to Mastercard's spending-related revenue. The company offers tools for agentic commerce, through which AI agents can make purchases on behalf of consumers. From a services perspective, there are opportunities to sell merchants and financial partners on tools for authentication, loyalty and other areas that they might want when rolling out AI commerce offerings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Mehra thinks AI agents could help spur more transactions, which is good for Mastercard since the company generates revenue related to both the dollar value of transactions and the number of transactions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He explained that a consumer who is buying shoes and who also needs socks might buy them both from the same place to save time - but an AI agent might shop around and buy the items from two different places. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"What we will see is that the dollar value of spend might be the same across me buying a shoe and the socks, but you might get two transactions opposed to one,\" Mehra said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read on: American Express sees credit-card spending accelerate </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Victories Square is part of a larger mixed-use development plan that includes a 139-room Courtyard by Marriott and two commercial buildings with several high-profile retail and restaurant tenants.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“It’s been an honor to partner with Odawa Economic Development Management Inc. and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians to bring this vital development to life,” said Kirsten Elliott, CEO at Community Housing Network. “With a critical shortage of affordable housing across our state, these new homes will empower families and workers in Petoskey to live, work and thrive within their own community.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nEach home is equipped with a dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, washer and dryer connections, Energy Star kitchen appliances, LED lighting, walk-in closets, exterior storage and central air conditioning.

Analysts had forecast growth of 8.2% in subscriptions and 3.15% in streaming, according to Visible Alpha. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The record label attributed the lack of streaming growth to changing consumer habits as users increasingly turn to short-form platforms to consume music as opposed to better monetized video platforms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Universal's physical revenue, which includes CD and vinyl sales, jumped 23% at constant currency to 341 million euros.

I've been taught my whole life to max out - to the extent that I'm able to - my 401(k) and a Roth IRA, slowly grow a \"rainy day\" savings account, and try to participate in the stock market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This amounts to a lot, and I'm fortunate to not have a ton of debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I learned recently that adhering to this guidance might be overly restrictive and prevent me from taking personal investment risks such as starting a project, investing in someone I know, or taking the time to pursue something more recreational. I feel a little caught between traditional guidance and more modern flexibility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Responsible Risk Taker </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're just starting out on your money or career journey and have questions about how to navigate your finances, we want to hear from you. Write to Dollar Signs, MarketWatch's new advice column, at dollarsigns@marketwatch.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Responsible, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Someone like you - young, financially disciplined - could absolutely stand to take some more risks. If you're saving for retirement, have an emergency fund and are participating in the stock market, putting money toward a hobby or a friend's passion project is totally reasonable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, you should know that if you give money to a friend to build a business or expand their side hustle, you will probably never see that money again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many people promise returns that are not guaranteed. I'm reminded of a person who wrote in to our Moneyist column a few years ago. They took $70,000 out of their 401(k) to invest in their friend's business and were told they'd be able to sell their shares for three times that amount. This was not the case. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I say that not to scare you, but to help manage your expectations about how these investments are likely to play out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Look at this spending as an investment in your happiness, not a way to build your wealth, said Kate Feeney, a CFP at Summit Place Financial Advisors in Summit, N.J. Some of her clients are spending money on hobbies like woodworking and glass blowing. But they are doing so as an investment in themselves, not as a way to generate financial returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whatever you choose to invest in, \"I think you have to do so because it's interesting and fulfilling to you, not because it's going to help you achieve financial goals,\" Feeney said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And never invest more than you can afford to lose. Feeney suggests putting less than 10% of your fun money toward personal projects: \"The amount should be something you're comfortable with going to zero,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Creating a budget can quell some of your risk-taking anxiety </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From this letter, I'm gleaning that reckless spending isn't in your nature - and I don't want my advice to cause some sort of overcorrection. You shouldn't be thoughtlessly throwing money at whatever excites you that day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And, to be clear, by age 30 you should (ideally) have the equivalent of one year's salary saved in a retirement account and an emergency fund that covers at least six months' worth of expenses. The average 401(k) savings for someone between ages 30 and 34 is $45,700, according to Fidelity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You should also aim to have a diversified portfolio. You can do this by investing in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track stock-market indexes like the S&amp;P 500 . If you want to take on a little more risk, you can invest in the Nasdaq 100 , which tracks tech companies and, traditionally, experiences more volatility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you check all those boxes and stay mindful of the caveats I mentioned, you don't need to stress about putting money toward more fun endeavors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, create a budget for these riskier moves so you don't end up overspending on them. Doing even a little bit of planning can also help alleviate some anxiety you might have about going against traditional investing advice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Anxiety stems from not having a plan and not feeling like you have everything lined up,\" said Nancy Listiawan, a CFP and founder of Veral Wealth in Pasadena, Calif. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Calculate how much you want to invest in a personal project each month and stick to that number. Then it won't feel like a loss as much as a planned expense. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ensuring that your future self has a strong financial safety net is wise, but it's not the only purpose of your income. Your money should also, hopefully, help you have a more fulfilling life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Money is a tool,\" Listiawan said. In other words, you can use it to travel, save for retirement, invest in the stock market and even help out a friend with a business idea - as long as you put any loan agreement in writing, and know you could lose all of your investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Running out of money in your 70s would be tragic, but so would being so restrictive that you don't enjoy your youth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Aditi Shrikant </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account.

Instead, adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All that tech money won't do you much good sitting in your bank account. Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear.

The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) are reporting their quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As MarketWatch reported Wednesday, a $5 trillion market cap is bigger than the 2024 gross domestic products of every country except the U.S. and China, and equals the International Monetary Fund projections for Germany's nominal GDP this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also Wednesday, Microsoft posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell, in addition to quarterly reports from Google's Alphabet and Facebook's Meta. Investors were surprised by how much Microsoft spent on chips, and the stock fell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity: \"The 7-year rule is one of the simplest asset allocation rules of thumb to understand. It simply states that you should only invest money in the stock market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This rule will help you weather market downturns and the day-to-day news headlines that can negatively impact your investments,\" it said. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to your financial adviser, obviously, but consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
