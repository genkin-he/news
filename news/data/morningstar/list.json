A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 6, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided investors with material information concerning their expected results for the Phase 3 Orbit and COSMIC studies for setrusumab in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in setrusumab's ability to ultimately reduce the annualized fracture rates of the tested patients and in the study itself to put setrusumab in an opportunity to succeed in reaching statistical significance of this key endpoint.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The defendants, the lawsuit claims, provided these positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating false and materially misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of the Phase 3 ORBIT and COSMIC programs; neither of which hit their primary endpoints of reducing annualized clinical fracture rate compared to the placebo or bisphosphonate control groups, respectively. Such statements absent these material facts caused investors to purchase Mereo's ADSs at artificially inflated prices. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Mereo class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=3988179742&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D52452&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D52452\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=52452</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

The restructuring will bring Block's (XYZ) employee count below 6,000 versus more than 10,000 today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Block soared 23.5% in after-hours action on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The layoffs at Block come just days after Citrini Research rattled markets with the publication of a blog post detailing a fictional scenario in which AI productivity tools were so powerful that they forced widespread shifts in the U.S. labor market. These particularly impacted knowledge workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" CEO Jack Dorsey said in a shareholder letter. \"We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By \"intelligence tools,\" the company is referring to AI and automation. CFO Amrita Ahuja said that Block has seen sizable productivity gains recently, not just among programmers but also within the broader company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within a year, Dorsey expects other companies to follow suit with \"similar structural changes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,\"  he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev also wondered whether the move would set a precedent for other technology companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block's \"deliberate and bold\" decision to dramatically reduce its workforce comes \"from a position of strength,\" according to Ahuja, as the company just exceeded expectations with various financial metrics and lifted its outlook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In its fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday, Block reported earnings per share of 65 cents, down from 71 cents a year before but ahead of the FactSet consensus by a penny. Gross profit, which is seen by Wall Street as a reasonably clean barometer for Block's top-line performance, was up 24% from a year before to $2.87 billion. Analysts were looking for $2.74 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block now expects 18% growth in gross profit for the full year, above the 17% target it set at an investor day late last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That new outlook reflects a \"recognition of our ability to continue to drive against our roadmap\" with a \"smaller, more nimble, flatter organizational structure,\" Ahuja said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The deceleration was driven largely by a 9.2% plunge in energy prices after the government rolled out subsidies to help households cope with rising living costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That marked the first time the Tokyo gauge has fallen below the Bank of Japan's 2% target since October 2024, but the print likely won't shift expectations on monetary policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central bank has been maintaining a cautious but positive stance on further interest-rate hikes following a round of tightening that brought the policy rate to 0.75% in December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute economist Takuya Hoshino said the Tokyo data was \"broadly firm,\" pointing out that service prices, which have a strong correlation with wage growth, rose 1.5%, up slightly from January. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A core measure of inflation which strips out volatile fresh food and energy prices also edged up to 2.5% in February. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While consumer inflation excluding fresh food continued to slow, \"the results are unlikely to deter the BOJ from raising interest rates further,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant agreed, saying that the slew of economic indicators, including inflation figures, released Friday \"suggest that the BOJ won't wait much longer before hiking rates again.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Markets are currently pricing in a nearly 60% chance of a rate hike in April, according to data from money market broker Tokyo Tanshi. Traders and BOJ officials are closely monitoring how Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's planned sales tax cut will affect price trends. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Separate government data on Friday meanwhile signaled that consumption remains solid, with retail sales rising 1.8% in January from a year earlier. Industrial production rose 2.2% on the month in January on the back of front-loaded demand ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, a sharp reversal from December's 0.1% decrease. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Still, there is continued uncertainty around the outlook for Japanese manufacturers. If weakness in the sector drags on broader economic growth, that could dent the case for rate hikes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While the U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down so-called reciprocal tariffs, Japanese officials have warned that automobile levies continue to weigh on the industry and said they will continue monitoring the impact of President Trump's new tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Policymakers say the nation's corporate sector remains resilient despite the headwinds posed by U.S. trade policy, but Friday's data showed factory activity is expected to weaken again in the coming months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Norinchukin Research Institute economist Takeshi Minami said increasing tensions between Japan and China could weigh on production down the road. Earlier this week, China said that it will ban the export of items that have potential military applications, targeting a list of Japanese companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Diplomatic tensions between the two countries have intensified following Takaichi's remarks last year suggesting Japan's potential involvement in any conflict over Taiwan. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 21:59 ET (02:59 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
