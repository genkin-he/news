            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat co-founder also believes Mag 7 and crypto are near bottoms </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat's Tom Lee is calling the end, nearly, of the AI scare trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia delivered solid results, but there's just a smattering of applause so far, and no sign of a rally for Thursday as investors near the end of what has been a tough month for stocks tied to the AI trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also declared \"markets got it wrong\" over the software selloff, so we'll see his view takes hold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You'll find some concurrence with Huang in our call of the day from co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who believes that selloffs for software, Magnificent 7 stocks and crypto are nearly done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee said markets tend to bottom on bad news, flagging the viral AI doom post from Citrini Research that shook up investors at the start of the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I think that we're seeing signs that we could be far along into that bottom,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Mag 7 stocks MAGS have been rising since Feb. 17. Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as he sees the rotation out of those stocks nearing an extreme level. Software is 99% done with a selloff now in the final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the last weeks of a pullback, he says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median monthly average decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That gives way to an even stronger March performance, potentially an average gain of 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement. The current one is up to 90%, so he thinks that process is nearly finished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is known as one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters who correctly told investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market. But he's also made pretty bullish calls on crypto, suggesting last summer that bitcoin could \"easily get to $200,000\" by the end of 2025, and has predicted it could top $1 million in a few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee also weighed in on Nvidia's earnings, pointing to record quarterly revenue and strong net income, plus shares trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, so about half of Costco's (COST) multiple. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's what's necessary to return the incredibly concentrated U.S. stock market to normal levels </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are slipping, with gold (GC00), silver (SI00) and oil (CL00) under pressure. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Key asset performance                                                Last       5d     1m      YTD     1y \n   S&amp;P 500                                                              6946.13    0.94%  -0.46%  1.47%   16.62% \n   Nasdaq Composite                                                     23,152.08  1.75%  -2.96%  -0.39%  21.37% \n   10-year Treasury                                                     4.054      -2.60  -18.60  -11.80  -21.10 \n   Gold                                                                 5203.8     4.16%  -3.83%  20.12%  77.50% \n   Oil                                                                  65.62      1.05%  3.34%   14.30%  -4.65% \n   Data: MarketWatch.

            "title": "Why strategist Tom Lee believes the AI bloodbath and crypto selloff is almost over",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat co-founder also believes Mag 7 and crypto are near bottoms </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat's Tom Lee is calling the end, nearly, of the AI scare trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia delivered solid results, but there's just a smattering of applause so far, and no sign of a rally for Thursday as investors near the end of what has been a tough month for stocks tied to the AI trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also declared \"markets got it wrong\" over the software selloff, so we'll see his view takes hold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You'll find some concurrence with Huang in our call of the day from co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who believes that selloffs for software, Magnificent 7 stocks and crypto are nearly done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee said markets tend to bottom on bad news, flagging the viral AI doom post from Citrini Research that shook up investors at the start of the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I think that we're seeing signs that we could be far along into that bottom,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Mag 7 stocks MAGS have been rising since Feb. 17. Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as he sees the rotation out of those stocks nearing an extreme level. Software is 99% done with a selloff now in the final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the last weeks of a pullback, he says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median monthly average decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That gives way to an even stronger March performance, potentially an average gain of 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement. The current one is up to 90%, so he thinks that process is nearly finished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is known as one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters who correctly told investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market. But he's also made pretty bullish calls on crypto, suggesting last summer that bitcoin could \"easily get to $200,000\" by the end of 2025, and has predicted it could top $1 million in a few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee also weighed in on Nvidia's earnings, pointing to record quarterly revenue and strong net income, plus shares trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, so about half of Costco's (COST) multiple. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's what's necessary to return the incredibly concentrated U.S. stock market to normal levels </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are slipping, with gold (GC00), silver (SI00) and oil (CL00) under pressure. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Key asset performance                                                Last       5d     1m      YTD     1y \n   S&amp;P 500                                                              6946.13    0.94%  -0.46%  1.47%   16.62% \n   Nasdaq Composite                                                     23,152.08  1.75%  -2.96%  -0.39%  21.37% \n   10-year Treasury                                                     4.054      -2.60  -18.60  -11.80  -21.10 \n   Gold                                                                 5203.8     4.16%  -3.83%  20.12%  77.50% \n   Oil                                                                  65.62      1.05%  3.34%   14.30%  -4.65% \n   Data: MarketWatch.

The Company possesses fantastic brands and has strong category growth tailwinds at its back. I see a clear path to create tremendous value for our shareholders and intend to make a sizable open-market purchase of Nomad shares in the coming weeks to express my confidence and align my interests with our shareholders. The value creation, however, will not be immediate and we have work to do to unlock our full potential. We have a number of opportunities to address in the organization, and we will be focused on these in the coming months. We continue to streamline the organization to increase our speed, agility, focus and accountability. We believe this will help us improve our commercial execution while unlocking additional resources for reinvestment. We are also ensuring that the right talent, sourced both internally and externally, is in the right roles to help us succeed. We believe we can and will deliver better results, but we anticipate 2026 being a transition year as our financial outlook reflects the time required to implement and manage change. I am excited to show investors what Nomad Foods is capable of once we see the results of our new approach.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Noam Gottesman, Nomad Foods' Co-Chairman and Founder, commented, \"While it has only been a few months, I am encouraged by the rapid changes being implemented at Nomad Foods and the multi-year vision that is beginning to unfold. Dominic and his team have a lot of work ahead of them, but they are starting from a good place. The company's portfolio is strong, category growth is robust and retail-sell out in 2025 delivered modest growth. The opportunity ahead is substantial.

An initial resource for Midlothian was published on December 18, 2025 with 590 million tonnes Inferred at 0.28% nickel. Midlothian, located in the Timmins Nickel District, is also well-positioned to leverage existing regional infrastructure. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">CEO Mark Selby said, \"Today's announcement is another exciting development in the Timmins Nickel District confirming Midlothian as a significant deposit. The strong results across all samples highlight the potential of this resource, which contains significant quantities of awaruite ranging from 0.25-0.36% and has the highest average nickel grade in our portfolio (0.28%) and total nickel grades more than 30% higher than other leading awaruite deposits. Midlothian is emerging as one of the most promising deposits in the District.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mr. Selby continued, \"We are encouraged by these early results, especially as initial DTR tests were done at coarser grind size than other deposits. A finer grind may yield even higher DTR nickel results. Because the awaruite mineralization has been confirmed to be widespread at Midlothian, the Company plans to assay all existing and future drill holes to allow a DTR nickel resource grade to be calculated in addition to a total recoverable nickel resource.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Midlothian Project</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Midlothian is located 64 kilometres southwest of Timmins and 20 kilometres west of Matachewan, Ontario. It is a large serpentinized ultramafic approximately 2.5 km long and up to 520 metres wide - with a geophysical footprint of 1.7 km<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2</span> (similar to the combined footprint of Crawford's Main and East Zones) - consisting mainly of a highly serpentinized dunite core with minor peridotite and significant awaruite nickel mineralization accounting for up to 79% of the total nickel content.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">An initial total nickel resource estimate was published at the end of 2025 (see news release December 18, 2025) containing an Inferred Resource of 0.59 billion tonnes grading 0.28% nickel for a total of 1.68 million tonnes of nickel. The resource estimate was based on 22 drillholes, where all drillholes were sampled for geochemical analysis at an average rate of one core sample per 1.5 metres. In addition, one sample every twenty core samples was selected and submitted for mineralogical (QEMSCAN) testing.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This release summarizes the mineralogical results for 177 samples from the first 14 of the 22 drillholes (Figure 1), as well as metallurgical results for four separate composite representing different mineralization styles within the deposit (Table 1). The results highlight the thoroughly serpentinized nature of the ultramafics and confirm the different mineral forms in which nickel is hosted. Mineralogical results on the remaining eight holes are pending. The nickel mineralization is dominated by a nickel-iron alloy (awaruite) and minor nickel sulphide (heazlewoodite) Figure 2, Table 1. Both awaruite and heazlewoodite are minerals that have a higher nickel tenor, ranging between 65-75% nickel content.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Brucite, a key mineral indicator for carbon sequestration potential was also identified by QEMSCAN. Midlothian contains significantly higher abundance than both Crawford's East and Main Zones.

The samples were subjected to Davis Tube testwork by grinding the samples and passing them through a magnet with wash water. The recovered magnetic fraction was then characterized as the \"Davis Tube Recoverable\" or \"DTR\" fraction. The test results summarized in Table 2 show DTR grades ranging from 0.07-0.15% nickel and 2.6-3.6% iron. There is potential to increase the DTR grades through finer grinding as the primary grind size of ~190 µm was coarser than what has been reported by others (e.g., 75 µm).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Table 2.

data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"/></span></strong>This press release includes measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company utilizes these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate operating performance on a consistent basis. These measures may also be used when making decisions regarding resource allocation and in determining incentive compensation. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results and business trends relative to past performance and the Company's competitors. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP measures in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Transform and Modernize (T&amp;M) Initiative <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company announced a multi-year T&amp;M initiative. In presenting non-GAAP measures, the Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) expenses for this initiative that are non-recurring, which are primarily project-based external consulting fees and expenses related to supply chain and portfolio optimization (e.g., asset write-offs, severance, or relocation-related costs). The Company believes that non-recurring costs associated with the T&amp;M initiative are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating cost structure; therefore, the Company is excluding these discrete costs. The Company does not adjust for (i.e., does not exclude) certain costs related to the T&amp;M initiative that are expected to continue after the project ends, such as software license fees and internal employee expenses, because those costs are considered ongoing in nature as a component of normal operating costs. The Company also does not adjust for savings realized through the T&amp;M initiative as these are considered ongoing in nature and reflective of expected future operating performance.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Gain or Loss on Sale of Business <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company sold 51% of its equity interest in Justin's, LLC, resulting in a gain on the sale. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company sold Mountain Prairie, LLC, a non-core sow operation, resulting in a loss on the sale. The Company believes the one-time impacts from these sales are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating cost structure, are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance, and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods. Thus, the Company has adjusted for (i.e., excluded) these impacts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Legal Matters <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>From time to time, the Company receives proceeds or incurs expenses related to discrete legal matters that the Company believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance, do not reflect expected future operating income or costs, and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods. The Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) these impacts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Litigation Settlements <br data-v-370fea16=\"\"/></em>In fiscal 2025, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a plaintiff in a pending antitrust litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Corporate Restructuring Plan <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company commenced a corporate restructuring plan, the focus of which is to reduce administrative expenses, improve efficiencies, and align the workforce to the Company's future needs, while enabling continued investment in the Company's growth. The costs incurred to execute the corporate restructuring plan and the charges incurred under the program are primarily related to severance and employee benefit costs. Because the Company believes the charges incurred under the corporate restructuring plan do not reflect future operating costs and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods, the Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) these impacts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Consulting Agreement <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>On October 27, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement with its former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), pursuant to which the former CEO is expected to provide consulting services to the Company until April 2027. Consulting costs related to the agreement include cash and share-based compensation, which were primarily recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The Company believes non-recurring costs associated with the consulting agreement are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating cost structure, are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance, and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods; therefore, the Company is excluding these discrete costs.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The tables below show the calculations to reconcile from the GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures presented in this press release.

The program was successfully completed and achieved cumulative annual run-rate benefits of $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, in the range of estimated program benefits of $150 million to $200 million (not including related depreciation expense on capital investments). Total costs incurred over the same period including capital investments, restructuring expenses and implementation costs were $286 million, below the estimated range of $300 million to $350 million originally expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2028, with the substantial portion of the costs incurred by the end of FY2025.

These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our, or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In particular, statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or future performance contained in this report, including certain statements contained in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"predict,\" \"potential\" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including: our ability to complete the proposed divestment of the Dermacosmetics branded business, receipt of works council and regulatory approval regarding the transaction, performance by counterparties to the transaction and the likelihood of satisfying the deferred payment milestones associated with the transaction, supply chain impacts on our business, including those caused or exacerbated by armed conflict, trade and other economic sanctions and/or disease; general economic, credit, and market conditions; increased or new tariffs by the U.S. or foreign governments (and any retaliatory or reciprocal tariffs) and changes in global trade relations; the impact of the war in Ukraine and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business, including the Middle East; current and future impairment charges, if we determine that the carrying amount of specific assets may not be recoverable from the expected future cash flows of such assets; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than we do; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions and any litigation relating thereto, ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain and maintain our regulatory approvals; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; potential adverse changes to U.S. and foreign tax, healthcare and other government policy; the effect of epidemic or pandemic disease; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases (or the absence thereof) and/or any refinancing of outstanding debt at or prior to maturity; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; receipt of potential earnout payments in connection with the sale of the HRA Rare Diseases Business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with this transaction may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or operations; the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with the sale of our Rx business may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or operations; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and our ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and our ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our ongoing restructuring programs described herein. Adverse results with respect to pending litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity, and could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay damages, reducing assets that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. These and other important factors, including those discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, and in any subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and exited products, and the impact of currency,</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">adjusted gross profit,</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">adjusted gross margin,</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">adjusted operating income,</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">adjusted operating margin,</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">adjusted net income,</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">adjusted diluted earnings per share,</li></ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide transparency to our investors because they are measures that management uses to assess both management performance and the financial performance of our operations and to allocate resources. In addition, management believes that these measures may assist investors with understanding and evaluating our initiatives to drive improved financial performance and enables investors to supplementally compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. While we have excluded certain of these items from historical non-GAAP financial measures, there is no guarantee that the items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures will not continue into future periods. For instance, we expect to continue to experience and report restructuring-related charges associated with continued execution of our strategic initiatives.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as amortization expense, unusual litigation, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which may include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, constant currency net sales, and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. In addition, the Company presents non–GAAP measures for 'CORE' Perrigo, reflecting its go–forward business and excluding infant formula currently under strategic review and previously announced divestitures. CORE measures may include CORE net income, CORE net sales, CORE organic net sales, CORE gross profit, CORE operating income, CORE diluted earnings per share, CORE gross margin, and CORE operating margin, including on an organic, constant–currency basis. Management believes these measures provide greater consistency in financial reporting and facilitate meaningful comparisons of underlying operating results and acquisition and divestiture activity.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Company cannot reconcile its 'All In' or 'CORE' expected organic net sales growth, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, net leverage, or adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures under \"Fiscal Year 2026 Outlook from Continuing Operations\" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include, but are not limited to, uncertainty of non-recurring infant formula related charges and timing and amount of restructuring charges and the income tax effects of these items or other income tax-related events.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the Company's website at <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc

Hosted on the Canton Fair's always-on digital platform, the themed event connects global buyers and suppliers year-round, removing time and location barriers to support more efficient, resilient international trade and supply chains.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The March showcase centers on how building and furniture are responding to rising priorities around safety, functionality, and long-term performance. Rather than viewing buildings and interiors as static spaces, many of the featured products address how people interact with cooking areas, storage areas, and architectural surfaces in daily life.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For water usage, growing attention to water quality and ease of use is shaping product design. Integrated kitchen faucet systems that combine filtered and regular water functions respond to households seeking safer water consumption without sacrificing convenience. Independent water channels and multi-layer filtration concepts illustrate how manufacturers are aligning with stricter international standards while offering flexible configurations suited to diverse market requirements.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Furniture and interior storage systems are also evolving as smart features move beyond entertainment and lighting into more private spaces. In wardrobes and dressing areas, material innovation is increasingly paired with intelligent functions that support health-focused living. Environmental control, hygiene-oriented features, and adaptable lighting illustrate how furniture is becoming an active part of everyday home routines, particularly for families with heightened sensitivity to indoor conditions.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In the building materials segment, innovation continues to focus on performance, versatility, and aesthetics. Advances in large-format, ultra-thin surface materials have expanded their use from traditional architectural applications into customized home furnishings. With enhanced strength, flexibility, and a variety of surface finishes, these materials are being adopted across cabinetry, wall panels, and decorative elements.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For buyers with more specific sourcing needs, the Canton Fair online platform offers a dedicated Sourcing Request function. This feature allows international purchasers to submit detailed requirements, enabling suppliers with matching capabilities to initiate targeted engagement, further improving efficiency and responsiveness in cross-border trade.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Through its March Industry Thematic Event, the Canton Fair continues to provide international buyers with ongoing access to emerging solutions and reliable partners across the building and home sectors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information, please click<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://buyer.cantonfair.org.cn/register/buyer/email?source_type=16\" tabindex=\"0\">https://buyer.cantonfair.org.cn/register/buyer/email?source_type=16</a></p><span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921129/Canton_Fair.html\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921129/Canton_Fair.jpg\"/></picture></span></a></p></span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"> </p>\n<span>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN96568&amp;sd=2026-02-26\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canton-fairs-march-industry-thematic-event-puts-spotlight-on-evolving-building-and-furniture-solutions-302698261.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canton-fairs-march-industry-thematic-event-puts-spotlight-on-evolving-building-and-furniture-solutions-302698261.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Canton Fair</p></span>\n</div>",
