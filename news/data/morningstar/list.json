data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThis press release makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures including key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors in the SaaS industry. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include “Annual Recurring Revenue”, “Average Contract Value”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Net Income”, “Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted”, “Working Capital” and “Free Cash Flow”.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Key Performance Indicators</em></strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers. The terms of our agreements, combined with high customer retention rates, provides us with a significant degree of visibility into our near-term revenues. Management uses a number of metrics, including the ones identified below, to measure the Company’s performance and customer trends, which are used to prepare financial plans and shape future strategy. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.\n\n</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Annual Recurring Revenue:</em> We define Annual Recurring Revenue as the annualized equivalent value of the subscription revenue of all existing contracts (including Original Equipment Manufacturer contracts) as at the date being measured, excluding non-recurring revenues from implementation, support and maintenance fees. Our customers generally enter into annual or multi-year contracts which are non-cancellable or cancellable with penalty. Accordingly, our calculation of Annual Recurring Revenue assumes that customers will renew the contractual commitments on a periodic basis as those commitments come up for renewal. Subscription agreements may be subject to price increases upon renewal reflecting both inflationary increases and the additional value provided by our solutions. In addition to the expected increase in subscription revenue from price increases over time, existing customers may subscribe for additional features, learners or services during the term. We believe that this measure provides a fair real-time measure of performance in a subscription-based environment. Annual Recurring Revenue provides us with visibility for consistent and predictable growth to our cash flows. Our strong total revenue growth coupled with increasing Annual Recurring Revenue indicates the continued strength in the expansion of our business and will continue to be our focus on a go-forward

The money is not currently in a bank account and it is not part of an estate - let's assume it's just cash in an envelope - and I live in a state with no inheritance tax. I assume I can make this deposit legally and that there will be no tax consequences. Am I correct? Must I provide a recent death certificate? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lone Ranger </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 2025 has been one hell of a year. Consumers should expect more 'silent pain' in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how this money was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope - and I'm not sure I want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In any case, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect potential money laundering. It does not mean that you have done anything wrong, so as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong, it should not create a problem for you. But there should be a paper trail in case you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What if you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? Deliberately breaking up financial transactions to avoid triggering reports that are required by law is called \"structuring,\" and it's illegal. The authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a magnifying glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and was not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of a death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's death. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax versus estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the bank teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent, the bank might request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     No one should be 'all-in' or stay 'all-out' of AI, says Oaktree co-founder </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Howard Marks is much less skeptical about AI than he was just a few months ago </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In December, Howard Marks published an investment memo titled, \"Is it a bubble?\" that expressed some of his skepticism and reservations about artificial intelligence and the stock market boom it had created. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A few months and one tutorial from Anthropic's Claude AI model later, Marks' latest investment memo has the header \"AI hurtles ahead.\" It's fair to say that if Marks hasn't been completely converted to a bull on AI investment, he is now convinced of the revolutionary technological benefits it brings. He guesses its potential is underestimated, but warns that may not mean the investment price is right. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, Marks' opinions are well-regarded. So when a few months back he cautioned about \"the regularity of bubbles,\" \"bubble behavior\" and the \"end result is inevitably painful,\" investors in AI stocks sat up and listened. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Encouraged by some of those investors to try out a few of the AI models available, Marks placed the Claude bot under scrutiny and came away thoroughly impressed. It's not quite a Damascene conversion, but he's certainly much more open to the technology's upside potential. For example, he kicks off with, \"Before I start in, I want to try to communicate the level of awe with which I viewed Claude's output\". </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given the week of bad PR that AI has endured in the aftermath of a viral Citrini Research paper, whose portrait of economic doom was heightened further by Block's decision to halve its workforce and shed 4000 jobs, the AI industry needed a boost. Now it has received what it can plausibly describe as a ringing endorsement from one of America's most reputable and experienced investors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What impressed Marks was the ability of AI to act autonomously, he said.  \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Commenting on the massive leap in capabilities in just a few months, Marks makes the point that in terms of analyzing information: \"AI possesses a lot of the qualities one needs to be a good investor.\" Citing ChatGPT-5.3 Codex and Claude's Opus 4.6, Marks notes AI is making \"intelligent decisions and even contributing to its own code and improvement, creating an accelerating feedback loop.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When it comes to making investment decisions, he now acknowledges that like indexation became a competitive threat to active investment management, AI may well push out \"average\" investors, partly because its rationale won't be tainted with human emotions like greed and fear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weighing the scales now, as opposed to his December debate over whether the AI investment theme is a bubble or not, Marks concludes by emphasizing that just because the technology is real and revolutionary doesn't mean that every investment is safe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He regards circular revenue and \"lottery-ticket startups\" as risky. He is deeply worried about \"labor displacement\" but overall, concludes it's just too early to say whether AI is \"a fad or an illusion\". </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Forecasts suggest Howard Marks (and many other commentators) are right to be concerned about labor displacement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not knowing whether the investment in AI infrastructure can produce an adequate return, Marks finds it hard to say whether hyperscalers are under or overvalued. The potential for AI is most likely underestimated, he believes,  \"but that's not the same as saying AI investments are on the bargain counter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"No one should go all-in... but by the same token, no one should stay all-out.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Giulia Petroni </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet Sunday with a familiar dilemma: add barrels to the market or continue holding back against a fragile geopolitical backdrop. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OPEC+, the alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided to keep output steady in the first quarter after a series of production increases last year. Analysts say the group is now expected to resume hikes, starting with a modest increase of 137,000 barrels a day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  An output boost would signal the alliance is restarting the gradual rollback of voluntary cuts of around 1.65 million barrels a day originally set to remain in place through the end of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Some analysts expect the remaining curbs to be unwound within six months, while others see the process stretching to year-end. Many warn, however, that only about half of any quota increase typically translates into actual output, as some members face capacity constraints. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OPEC didn't respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"The oil market should be able to absorb further barrels,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, strategist at UBS. The ICE Brent forward curve remains in backwardation--meaning near-term oil prices are higher than future prices--suggesting the market is tight in the short term. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Goldman Sachs sees OPEC+ positioned to raise production modestly from April to June after a series of supply disruptions earlier this year, particularly in Kazakhstan, and due to lower-than-expected inventories in OECD countries. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Much of the anticipated surplus remains outside major pricing hubs, with Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan barrels accumulating on tankers at sea. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns are keeping front-month prices supported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In midmorning European trading Friday, Brent traded around $71 a barrel, while WTI was above $65 a barrel. A February survey of major Wall Street banks compiled by The Wall Street Journal showed Brent crude is expected to average at around $61 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $58 in the second quarter--above previous projections by around $1, but still below 2025 levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The resumption of output hikes would come as markets closely monitor developments in the Middle East, wary that any escalation between the U.S. and Iran could disrupt energy flows in the oil-rich region. The two countries are expected to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks wrapped up on Thursday without a deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"Any escalation of conflict is likely to see OPEC step in to calm the market,\" said Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari, commodity analysts at ANZ Research. If disruptions occur, OPEC+ is expected to tap spare capacity--with most of it sitting in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 05:38 ET (10:38 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Kelsi Karruli </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The property offers sweeping views of the mountains, valleys, and ocean. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gene Simmons is spotted at an L.A. Clippers basketball game in Inglewood, Calif., Jan. 12, 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Music legend Gene Simmons has yet again slashed the asking price of his former Beverly Hills home-months after trimming a half-million dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Simmons, 76, initially listed the \"exceptional\" home for the staggering price of $13.99 million. That sum was reduced to $13.49 million in September. It's now priced at $12.5 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In total, the home has undergone a steep $1.49 million price cut. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The musician does still stand to make a profit on the sale of the property, even at the reduced ask. He purchased it for $10.5 million in 2021 to use as a California home base after he and his wife, Shannon Tweed Simmons, moved to Las Vegas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the Kiss rocker's property portfolio became increasingly complicated as a result of his Nevada relocation. It turned out to be nothing but a brief dalliance for the couple, who struggled with the area's punishing heat. They ultimately decided that they'd be better off returning to California. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What followed was a dramatic reshuffling of Simmons' real estate collection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, the rock legend listed his expansive Henderson, Nevada, property-along with an adjacent lot-just a few months after buying it, initially asking $13.5 million. He ultimately accepted an offer of just under $11 million two years later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The sale was a bit of a bitter pill for Simmons to swallow, leaving him with just $200,000 in profit after he paid $10.8 million for the combined properties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     KISS rocker Gene Simmons testifies in Washington, D.C. at a Senate hearing on \"Balancing the Interests of Local Radio, Songwriters, and Performers in the Digital Age,\" on Dec. 9, 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, he came out of the transaction in the black-a result he celebrated by snapping up another expansive mansion in California in September 2024, which he and his wife are now using as their primary residence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Property records reveal that Simmons picked up the \"one-of-a-kind\" Malibu estate for $25 million using the same LLC through which he purchased his Beverly Hills abode-which he put on the market just seven months later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Malibu home sits on a 2.5-acre blufftop spread that is, per its original listing, \"surrounded by stunning ocean views\" and hundreds of trees, offering a lush environment that serves as the perfect sanctuary for any star. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adding to that feeling of privacy and security is the home's prime location behind its own gates, which create a safe barrier between Simmons and the outside world. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The residence was built using eco-friendly materials, including recycled steel and sustainable timber, and sources much of its power from Tesla (TSLA) batteries and solar panels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Additional eco-friendly luxury features are the \"water vapor fireplaces,\" built-in water filtration, and air ventilation system, which \"ensure a healthy lifestyle at all times.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The home features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as a luxurious chef's kitchen, a home theater, two wine rooms, and a full gym. Out back, there's a saltwater pool, spa, basketball court, bocce court, putting green, and driving range. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The 14,500-square-foot abode is almost twice the size of the Beverly Hills home that Simmons and his wife are still desperately trying to sell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may well be that Simmons' rather strict regulations for prospective buyers had led some to pause before even considering putting in an offer on the property-after he publicly stated that he would refuse to sell the dwelling to anyone who he feared might soil the happy memories he and his family have of their time in the home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You have such wonderful times there, you don't want some schmuck in the place you call home. No drugs, no alcoholics. I don't want anybody coming in there who is going to destroy the place,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in April. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: I'm 68, and I Sacrificed Our Second Bedroom to Build My Dream Bathroom for Less Than $15K </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Provided a buyer can make it through Simmons' strict selection process, they will have quite the opulent pad on their hands. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The pricey property, which is being listed by Lisa Young of Compass, comes with a \"40-foot glass-like infinity pool, dramatic drought-tolerant landscaping, and bold bronze geometric sculptures that offer a distinct artistic statement,\" according to a press release shared with Realtor.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Simmons' property was designed by Swiss architect Roger P. Kurath and is made of \"glass, steel, oak wood and concrete elements,\" which emphasize the sweeping views of the mountains, valleys, and ocean. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Home Prices Expected To Fall in Many Cities in 2026, Top Homebuilder Economist Says </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a statement, Simmons revealed that the views were what drew him to the property in the first place. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"My favorite part of the house is waking up in the morning in the upper bedroom, having coffee in bed, and on a clear day being able to see all the way out to the ocean,\" he shared. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"And my other favorite time is sunset in the upper bedroom or downstairs barbecuing something outdoors. The views really are spectacular.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The five-bathroom property boasts 12-foot ceilings, a gallery space, and a plush home theater. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Opulent Reno Trophy Estate Built by Late Casino King Lists for $14 Million </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And much like his newly purchased pad, Simmons' former home \"utilizes solar-power for pool and radiant heated flooring, eco-materials and fire-resistant, waterproof triple-panel windows.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This home is a rare example of Swiss architectural mastery, built with exceptional quality, thoughtful details, and a focus on longevity,\" Young adds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"From the Swiss steel framework and sleek fixtures to the fiber cement exterior panels that can go more than 50 years without maintenance, everything was designed to last.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Florida Migration Plunges 93% in 3 Years-but Miami Still Pulls High-Income Job Movers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The 40-foot glasslike infinity pool is a real showstopper, surrounded by lush, drought-tolerant landscaping, and the bold bronze geometric sculptures add a cool, artistic vibe to the outdoor space. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's the kind of property that's extremely rare and truly special-made even more iconic by having been home to a rock legend.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This story originally ran on Realtor.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

This approach is well-suited for organic boards, which cannot withstand eutectic die attach temperatures.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nStratEdge will also be available to discuss molded ceramic package options, including <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stratedge.com%2Fmc-series.html&amp;esheet=54435089&amp;newsitemid=20260227307562&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=MC+Series&amp;index=2&amp;md5=d06860207d1d97b3919d28e7e69becab\" tabindex=\"0\">MC Series</a> configurations for RF and microwave applications up to 18 GHz.

But we understand why designers of systems operating in Ku through E bands may decide the advantages of using a tab for COB outweigh the disadvantages.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nLearn more about StratEdge’s packaging and assembly capabilities at <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stratedge.com&amp;esheet=54435089&amp;newsitemid=20260227307562&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.stratedge.com&amp;index=3&amp;md5=2ff15e8f8f4e67ec3aac4a20056bbabd\" tabindex=\"0\">www.stratedge.com</a></strong>, and download the new white paper, <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Die-on-Tab for Compound Semiconductors: Enabling Advanced RF Power Systems</em></strong>, at <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stratedge.com%2Fwhite-paper-download-tab.html&amp;esheet=54435089&amp;newsitemid=20260227307562&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.stratedge.com%2Fwhite-paper-download-tab.html&amp;index=4&amp;md5=1995ad69962df030ce2f976293e7be59\" tabindex=\"0\">www.stratedge.com/white-paper-download-tab.html</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Photo:</strong> <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stratedge.com%2Fimapsdpc-gomachtech-tabs-molded-ceramic-parts.png&amp;esheet=54435089&amp;newsitemid=20260227307562&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.stratedge.com%2Fimapsdpc-gomachtech-tabs-molded-ceramic-parts.png&amp;index=5&amp;md5=3692c579844497425e0d7d76c4cd5203\" tabindex=\"0\">www.stratedge.com/imapsdpc-gomachtech-tabs-molded-ceramic-parts.png</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About StratEdge</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stratedge.com%2F&amp;esheet=54435089&amp;newsitemid=20260227307562&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=StratEdge+Corporation&amp;index=6&amp;md5=ce23a246ed222211a4146ff578f81b83\" tabindex=\"0\">StratEdge Corporation</a> designs, manufactures, and provides assembly services for a complete line of high-frequency and high-power semiconductor packages operating from DC to 63+ GHz.
