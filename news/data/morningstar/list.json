The new eConsent offering can be deployed in under four weeks and is available as a lightweight, cost‑effective module or as a fully integrated component of the DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn EDC and DCT ecosystem.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Unlike many eConsent tools that are bundled only within large, expensive ePRO or DCT packages, DATATRAK's standalone eConsent delivers flexible pricing so study teams can implement digital informed consent without paying for an entire ePRO system they do not need. Reasonable, study‑level pricing makes eConsent accessible for a broader range of trials and budgets, including early‑phase, single‑site, and investigator‑initiated studies.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Study teams want the benefits of modern eConsent-faster startup, better participant understanding, and cleaner documentation-without lengthy implementations or bloated platform costs,\" said Alex Tabatabai, CEO, DATATRAK. \"Our standalone eConsent is purpose‑built to launch quickly, fit into existing study infrastructure, and scale seamlessly when sponsors are ready to expand into DATATRAK EDC, ePRO, RTSM, CTMS, or full decentralized clinical trials.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Fast Startup, IND‑Ready Timelines</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The DATATRAK eConsent solution is designed for implementation timelines of under four weeks, allowing study teams to go live in time for IND or ethics approval and first‑patient‑in milestones. Configuration is supported by reusable templates and best‑practice workflows that help streamline approvals and site activation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Standalone eConsent with Enterprise‑Grade Integration</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The eConsent module can be used as a standalone utility and integrated with third‑party infrastructure, including external EDC, RTSM, CTMS, and eTMF systems, or deployed as a native component of DATATRAK EDC. When used with DATATRAK EDC, consent data and enrollment status are seamlessly connected to subject records, randomization, and visit schedules, enabling true end‑to‑end digital trial execution on a single platform.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Key Capabilities Include:</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">1.

Study teams can easily trigger and track re‑consent when protocol changes occur, ensuring every participant is on the correct version and that audit trails remain inspection‑ready.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The system also supports tracking and managing supporting documents such as witness statements, translations, and supplemental information, helping maintain complete, compliant records across sites and regions.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Flexible Patient Engagement and Enrollment Options</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To support both site‑based and remote enrollment, the eConsent solution enables sites to invite participants using multiple methods: email links, QR codes patients can scan on their own device, or direct registration by the physician or site staff. Sites can also schedule consent visits prior to trial enrollment, helping ensure participants have adequate time to review materials, ask questions, and complete consent in a controlled, compliant workflow.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">When combined with DATATRAK's EDC, ePRO, and eSource capabilities, sponsors can extend the same patient‑centric digital experience beyond consent to ongoing data collection and engagement throughout the study.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About DATATRAK</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn is transforming healthcare and life sciences through technological innovations by providing a unified, cloud based eClinical and decentralized clinical trial platform that brings together EDC, eSource, ePRO/eCOA, eConsent, RTSM, RBM, Adjudication, Imaging, Safety, Global Oversight and Enterprise Workflow Management, CTMS, eTMF, and DCT tools in a single, configurable environment.

The Motion to Dismiss states that the lawsuit is an attack on interoperability, threatening patient safety and efficient healthcare nationwide.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Motion to Dismiss explains that Plaintiffs bypassed mandatory contractual dispute resolution procedures designed to allow the networks to self-govern and resolve disagreements through established mechanisms and instead sought to escalate what is fundamentally a healthcare governance dispute into a federal action and smear campaign.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nMore broadly, the Motion describes the lawsuit as part of a pattern of conduct by Epic to deter both its competitors and customers from embracing innovation in interoperability, which undermines the framework and risks a more efficient, safer healthcare system. The lawsuit calls into question the networks’ ability to self-police, which threatens the stability of systems that providers rely on daily to deliver safe and efficient care.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Motion emphasizes that the lawsuit relies on facts that Health Gorilla provided to Epic after it willingly cooperated in investigations concerning certain network participants, during a months-long, exhaustive and voluntary process involving Carequality, the TEFCA network administrator, and several of the nation’s largest health providers. This clearly demonstrates Health Gorilla’s commitment to vet and investigate concerns, honoring its obligations to protect the system. None of the providers that joined Health Gorilla’s investigation are plaintiffs, which is telling.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Carequality and TEFCA protect patients by ensuring clinicians have the information they need at the point of care,” said Bob Watson, CEO of Health Gorilla. “Bypassing them risks destabilizing systems that hundreds of millions of patients and providers depend on.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHealth Gorilla’s priority remains unchanged: Preserve reliable treatment access while protecting privacy, security, and the integrity of the national interoperability ecosystem.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRead the full complaint here.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.prod.website-files.com%2F62719a041d28d7b5603dd995%2F69a0632f55ccce3651feff55_HG%2527s%2520Memo%2520ISO%2520MTD%2520C.D.%2520Cal.%252026-cv-00321%2520dckt%252056_001%25202026-02-26.pdf&amp;esheet=54434589&amp;newsitemid=20260226940871&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.prod.website-files.com%2F62719a041d28d7b5603dd995%2F69a0632f55ccce3651feff55_HG%2527s%2520Memo%2520ISO%2520MTD%2520C.D.%2520Cal.%252026-cv-00321%2520dckt%252056_001%25202026-02-26.pdf&amp;index=1&amp;md5=43ba3511cff75b04203bbe22b565ce17\" tabindex=\"0\">https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62719a041d28d7b5603dd995/69a0632f55ccce3651feff55_HG%27s%20Memo%20ISO%20MTD%20C.D.%20Cal.%2026-cv-00321%20dckt%2056_001%202026-02-26.pdf</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Health Gorilla</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nHealth Gorilla, a designated Qualified Health Information Network under TEFCA, provides interoperability solutions delivering secure, real-time access to deduplicated, AI-ready health data.
