Our uranium revenue is ramping up, and we signed two new long-term contracts with major utilities that are expected to increase our portfolio pricing in the coming years. In addition, we are investing significantly in our industry-leading U.S. assets, as we expect to remain the country's uranium leader for many years to come.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Equally impressive has been our progress in rare earth processing and production. Energy Fuels' rare earth products have been confirmed, qualified, and used by manufacturers for EVs and hybrid EVs. In 2025, we made considerable investments in our rare earth segment. We strongly believe now is the time to capture opportunities, as vertical integration and access to low-cost 'molecules' are the key to higher margins, increased market share, and overall competitiveness in the space. In years past, we invested 'upstream' by securing low-cost rare earth feedstock at our Donald joint venture in Australia, Vara Mada project in Madagascar, and Bahia project in Brazil. Now, we are investing 'downstream', including our recently announced proposed acquisition of Australian Strategic Materials (\"<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">ASM</strong>\"), which upon completion, will expand our reach into highly coveted rare earth metals and alloys. The proposed acquisition of ASM will also bring another potential material source of feedstock from the Dubbo project located in NSW, Australia.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Ross Bhappu, President of Energy Fuels, added \"We recently released feasibility studies for several of our development projects, including the proposed Phase 2 Circuit expansion of our rare earth processing at the White Mesa Mill in Utah and our Vara Mada project in Madagascar, demonstrating impressive net present values and future cashflows. The combined NPV of the Phase 2 Circuit and the Vara Mada project is $3.7 billion, or $15.26 per share (based on current shares outstanding), with expected EBITDA of $765 million for the first 15 years when the Phase 2 Circuit is combined with the expected EBITDA from the Vara Mada project over those years. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"With an estimated capital cost of $410 million for the Phase 2 Circuit and an estimated all-in production cost of $29.39/kg NdPr equivalent produced from our Vara Mada project, <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">we believe our REE oxide production ranks among the lowest capital and operating costs globally.</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mr. Bhappu continued, \"We believe interest in Energy Fuels is accelerating as customers, governments, and investors favor companies like us that deliver on promises.

These costs do not fully reflect the expected lower costs of recently mined ores from the Pinyon Plain mine, which had only been processed and added to finished inventories commencing in early October (a conventional ore processing run, including Pinyon Plain and La Sal/Pandora ores, commenced at the Mill in early October 2025).</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Pinyon Plain Update:</strong> The Company updated its existing S-K 1300 and NI 43-101 compliant pre-feasibility study, which was furnished through a Form 8-K filing on February 26, 2026.

These enhancements are expected to be made, and the Phase 1 Circuit operational to accept MREC and similar intermediary REE products in 2027.

The Company has been the leading U.S. producer of natural uranium concentrate for the past several years, which is sold to nuclear utilities that process it further for the production of carbon-free nuclear energy and owns and operates several conventional and in-situ recovery uranium projects in the western United States. The Company also owns the White Mesa Mill in Utah, which is the only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium processing facility in the United States. At the Mill, the Company also produces advanced REE products, vanadium oxide (when market conditions warrant), and is evaluating the recovery of certain medical isotopes from existing uranium process streams needed for emerging cancer treatments. The Company also owns the operating Kwale HMS project in Kenya which ceased mining and commenced final reclamation activities at the end of 2024, and is developing three (3) additional HMS projects: the Toliara Project in Madagascar; the Bahia Project in Brazil; and the Donald Project in Australia in which the Company has the right to earn up to a 49% interest in a joint venture with Astron Corporation Limited. The Company is based in Lakewood, Colorado, near Denver. The primary trading market for Energy Fuels' common shares is the NYSE American under the trading symbol \"UUUU,\" and the Company's common shares are also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"EFR.\" For more information on all we do, please visit <span class=\"mdc-article-underline\" data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"http://www.energyfuels.com\" tabindex=\"0\">www.energyfuels.com</a></span>.</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:</em></strong> <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">This news release contains certain \"Forward Looking Information\" and \"Forward Looking Statements\" within the meaning of applicable United States and Canadian securities legislation, which may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: any expectation that the Company will maintain its position as a leading U.S.-based critical minerals company or as the leading producer of uranium in the U.S.; any expectation with respect to timelines to production; any expectation as to rate, quantities or duration of production; any expectations as to uranium or other mineral grades and whether such grades will continue or change over time; any expectation as to costs of goods sold, costs of production or gross profits, gross margins or other margins; any expectation as to future sales or sales prices; any expectations as to future inventory levels or changes to inventory levels; any expectation that the Company will be profitable; any expectation that the REE separation techniques being utilized by Energy Fuels can also be applied to a wide range of feedstocks, including rare earth concentrates, and recycle materials; any expectation that the Company will develop its planned expansion of REE separation capacity at the Mill; any expectation that the Company's permitting efforts will be successful and as to any potential future production from any properties that are in the permitting or development stage; any expectation with respect to the Company's planned exploration programs; any expectation that any of the critical minerals the Company produces will have a valuable upside; any expectation that the proposed ASM acquisition will close; any expectation that the Company's Vara Mada Project or Donald Project will advance to an FID within the expected timeframes or at all;  any expectation that Energy Fuels will be successful in agreeing on fiscal terms with the Government of Madagascar or in achieving sufficient fiscal and legal stability for the Vara Mada Project; any expectation that the Company will be successful in its engineering and test work for the production of Ra-226 at the Mill; any expectation that the Company's evaluation of radioisotope recovery at the Mill will be successful; any expectation that any radioisotopes that can be recovered at the Mill will be sold on a commercial basis; any expectation as to the quantities to be delivered under existing uranium sales contracts; and any expectation as to future uranium, vanadium, REE or HMS prices or market conditions.
