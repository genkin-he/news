            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Within a week or two after the deadline to contest the will expired, my stepmother sent me an email stating she would not share anything' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"My siblings kept it a secret that our shares were all being given to my dad's new wife of two months.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If someone promises to share the wealth from a will and doesn't, you may have legal options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Maybe this will help someone else. I found out too late, but it appears you may have options if you are left with nothing in a new will and the new spouse says she will share the wealth - then, after the period to contest the will passes, says you get nothing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's called \"promissory estoppel\" and there is typically a three-year statutory limit to bring it to court. Also, look up constructive trust and attorney's fees (sometimes possible under equitable relief if bad faith is shown). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In my situation, my siblings kept it a secret that our shares were all being given to my dad's new wife of two months. The wedding was rushed, with only one sister in attendance. The will was changed months later, and after that, my dad died. That's when I found out about the new will. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A week later, the new wife told everyone she would share the wealth, including me personally. Contesting the will was going to be difficult because my wealthier siblings were okay with it. My dad had also suffered a heart attack within a week of signing the new will. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I wouldn't have ended up with much after legal fees, so I decided to see if she would share, as my siblings suggested. Within a week or two after the deadline to contest the will expired, my stepmother sent me an email stating she would not share anything. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether my siblings knew that would happen is unknown. That email is what starts the clock on estoppel. I thought it was over at that point, but that's actually when I had a much stronger case. This sudden marriage and subsequent will-change cost me about $500,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I also later learned that if parents have two similar wills and one of them dies, courts can consider it a joint will. That means the remaining parent cannot drastically change the will as happened in my case. I suggest saving copies of all wills for future reference. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's your take? Is it too late? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Stepson </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'People are often unreasonable when money is involved': My husband, 62, gave me a 5-year life estate. Would I have to pay for a new roof? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It ultimately depends on whether the promise was sound and/or whether you made decisions based on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Stepson, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yes, promissory estoppel is a legal doctrine in some states. But it may not be too late. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The deadline to contest a will can be a matter of months in many jurisdictions, but the statute for promissory estoppel varies from two years to six years, depending on where you live. The reason is not because you're contesting the will, but are effectively bringing a case against your stepmother's alleged breach of promise. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not sure your father's heart attack, which happened after he signed the new will, would play a part. Your stepmother could argue that they married specifically so she would inherit the estate. (An attorney could better advise you on the merits of your case, whether it applies in your state and/or if there is evidence that such a promise was not fulfilled.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That aside, you may have a good case. If your stepmother did indeed talk you out of suing by promising you a share of the estate, and you miss the deadline because you trusted her, the law may treat your lost lawsuit as the \"price\" you paid for that promise - or \"forbearance to sue\" - and may force your stepmother to honor her promise. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The facts, as you describe them, may not be regarded by the law as a casual promise. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The facts, as you describe them, may not be regarded by the law as a casual promise. Your stepmother appears to have persuaded you not to exercise your legal right - in this case, contesting probate - and then refusing payment. The court could see this as equitable fraud or unjust enrichment, usually easier to prove than promissory estoppel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If someone makes a promise that they should reasonably expect you to rely on - and it's reasonable for a normal person to rely upon that promise - and you get hurt because of that so-called \"reliance,\" a court may enforce the promise to prevent unfairness. So it ultimately depends on whether the promise was sound and/or whether you made decisions based on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A party plaintiff's misguided belief or guileless action in relying on a statement on which no reasonable person would rely is not justifiable reliance,\" according to Vondran Legal, which has offices in California and Arizona. \"If the conduct of the plaintiff in light of his own intelligence and information was manifestly unreasonable, he will be denied a recovery.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burden of proof </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As always, the burden of proof would be on you to make your case that your stepmother made an unambiguous promise. In legal terms, that could include a text, email or letter that says, \"I will give you $500,000 or one-third of the estate. (Other situations may include statements like, \"I'll cover your $5,000 moving expenses,\" or \"You have the job. You start in a month!\") </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If your stepmother acknowledged in the email she sent you after the statute of limitations expired on contesting the will, even implicitly, that she promised to give you $500,000, that could suffice. If would, possibly, prove admission of a prior promise and proof of reliance damages. Your lost chance to contest the will likely start the clock on the statute of limitations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Generally, you also have to show that you took actions or, in fact, chose not to do something, based on this promise that was detrimental to you financially. This evidence might include financial statements - perhaps you made a purchase based on the expectation that you were receiving $500,000 - or maybe held off on taking a lucrative job. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your lost chance to contest the will may start the clock on the statute of limitations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Identical wills are not joint wills. Joint wills are complicated and, unlike trusts that become irrevocable upon one spouse's death, are not necessarily unchangeable after one spouse dies. Mary G. LaGrone, a Nashville, Tenn.-based attorney, expresses caution about joint wills, one document signed by both spouses. \"Some probate courts won't even honor them,\" she says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A potentially serious drawback to a joint will is that once one of the spouses dies, the other can't make changes to it, no matter how necessary,\" she adds. \"If an adult child, for example, demonstrates that they're no longer able to handle their future inheritance - perhaps because they've developed a drug or gambling problem - there's nothing you can do about it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not clear that your father and stepmother's wills were mutual wills. \"These are two identical wills created by each spouse,\" LaGrone adds. \"They include an addendum - codicil - stipulating that neither can be changed unless both spouses agree. Just as with a joint will, this means that the surviving spouse can't change the terms of their will after their spouse dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a lot on your side. Just remember, an oral promise may not be enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: After bitcoin's fall, pity those wildly enthusiastic investors who borrowed billions against crypto </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Check out the Moneyist private Facebook group, where members help answer life's thorniest money issues.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your unwillingness to take out a loan may end up costing you more in the long run, given that you would have to pay income tax on withdrawals from your IRA, plus lost returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Nearing, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have an $18,000 problem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another issue: Your unwillingness to take out a loan may end up costing you more in the long run, given that you would have to pay income tax on withdrawals from your IRA, plus the amount of money you will lose in lost returns on those funds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here is the true lifetime cost of withdrawing $18,000 from your traditional IRA. First, you'd end up paying $3,000 to $5,500 in income tax, depending on your tax bracket, so you'd actually have to take out closer to $24,000 from your traditional IRA. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adding in the opportunity cost - over the next 20 years, the likely period of time when you will be making withdrawals from your retirement accounts - you would lose $47,800 in just unrealized returns at a conservative annual 5% rate of return. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So your unwillingness to take out any debt to pay for these repairs would actually cost you closer to $53,000. That's why you will hear CPAs and economists talk about \"good debt\" (HELOCs, in certain circumstances, and mortgages) and \"bad debt\" (credit cards). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An $18,000 home-equity line of credit (HELOC) would cost you approximately $212 a month with a 7.3% interest rate over 10 years (and cost $25,400 in total). Because HELOCs usually have variable rates, it would be better to pay it off faster than 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I believe you should take out a loan. You need to balance your future returns, how much money you have set aside for emergencies and taxes. If you do insist on tapping your retirement, use the cash, then move onto your Roth and, only as a last resort, dip into your traditional IRA. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Planning for retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taking a step back, in your 60s, you should be focusing on maximizing your savings, minimizing your tax burden in retirement, planning when to take your Social Security benefits and adjusting your risk profile so you're not vulnerable to stock-market shocks, especially in those early years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Charles Schwab (SCHW), if you're in a lower income-tax bracket (0%, 10% or 12% rate), \"consider maxing out your Roth savings, where you pay the taxes up front, because your tax bracket in retirement is likely to be the same or higher than it is today.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're in a middle tax bracket (22% or 24% rate) \"consider splitting your retirement savings between tax-deferred and Roth accounts so you can benefit from both tax treatments. You might also want to consider additional savings in an HSA,\" it adds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And if you're in a higher tax bracket (32%, 35% or 37% rate) your tax rate in retirement is likely to be the same or even lower than today, so maximize your tax-deferred accounts - in this case, your IRA. Every $1 contributed to a traditional account avoids taxes at 32%-37% today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other challenges you'll face - beyond your house repairs - will be your own repairs. That is, your medical bills. Without long-term-care insurance, you will at least have the value of your home to tap in the event you need to move to assisted living. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your retirement income </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's obviously not a lot to live on, but it doesn't include Social Security. When you decide to claim depends on when you need the income, but it also hinges on how long you expect to live. Are you a smoker? Are you in good health? How old did your parents live to be? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can also keep working and collect Social Security once you reach your full retirement age. \"Starting with the month you reach full retirement age, there is no limit on how much you can earn and still receive your benefits,\" the Social Security Administration says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your Social Security benefit is based on your 35 highest-earning years. For 2026, the maximum a person can earn in the year is $184,500. Social Security taxes will not be withheld above this limit. The maximum possible monthly Social Security benefit for 2025 is $5,251. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is the time to stress-test your retirement, based on your estimated expenses. The 4% rule assumes 30 years of withdrawals. That's based on historical market returns. So if you retire at 67: Your $531,500 could potentially last you 30 years, if you took $21,000 a year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are several programs that provide funds, grants and low-interest loans for house repairs for seniors. Check out the USDA Section 504 loans/grants, Weatherization Assistance Program, HUD Title 1 loans and non-profits like Rebuilding Together. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Think carefully before tapping your retirement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'She is planning to move out of state': My sister sold our elderly mother's house from under her.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son, I'm sorry to say, bears the responsibility for his own credit rating, even if his girlfriend was a reckless spender. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Mother, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son learnt a lesson the hard way. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The biggest lesson is about boundaries, personal and financial. It is, in fact, extremely difficult to ruin your credit rating because you lived with a person, unless your joint responsibilities - utilities, etc. - were not paid on time and/or your son allowed his girlfriend to use his credit cards to shop, or he himself got into the red paying for their joint lifestyle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son, I'm sorry to say, bears the responsibility for his own credit rating and, even if his girlfriend was a reckless spender and made demands on your son, he is the one who needs to do some soul-searching. Because if it happened once, and the finger of blame is being pointed at his girlfriend - perhaps an easy reaction - it could happen again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nor do I believe we should blame your son's girlfriend for using weight-loss drugs, which can be life-saving by helping to prevent diseases like diabetes. These medications, particularly GLP-1 brands like Wegovy (DK:NOVO.B) and Zepbound (LLY), can cost $1,000 a month or more without insurance coverage. The costs are obviously significantly less if someone has insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Unmarried couples are not legally bound to each other - marriage is a business contract as much as it is a legal and romantic one - so it would have taken a few naive or, frankly, head-scratching decisions by your son to mingle his finances with this lady. Did he leave credit cards lying around? Did he pay for her? Did they open a joint account for bills? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Without more detail, we can only speculate how your son's credit rating was ruined. But I am willing to bet that he made some unwise decisions about his own finances in the process. It's easy to look back on a broken relationship and blame one party, but as with most relationships - marriages or cohabitants - the responsibility is usually 50/50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cohabiting unmarried couples </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Like your son, more unmarried couples will face decisions about how and when to mingle their finances. Fewer than half (47%) of households last year were married couples - a big shift from 50 years earlier, when nearly two-thirds (66%) were married, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's historical America's Families and Living Arrangements. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Couples find it helpful to have one joint account in which each person contributes a set amount each month that is used solely for paying shared expenses,\" says wealth-management firm Focus Partners. \"Outline specifically all the shared expenses and those that you will be responsible for individually. How much you contribute to the joint account is up to you.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It is much easier to figure out the details in times of happiness and bliss than at the end of a relationship when you might be acting from a place of anger or hurt,\" the firm adds. \"It may be a good idea to draft a domestic partnership agreement with an attorney that spells out the legal and financial responsibilities of each partner and how you would split anything jointly owned.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I receive many letters from readers who wonder about the wisdom of commingling their finances. This woman, for instance, did not mingle her finances with her first husband, but is buying a home with her second husband and told me that she intends on rolling $150,000 - the proceeds from the sale of her home - into her new purchase. That would be a mistake. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son, I believe, has a lot of questions to ask himself. HIs ex-girlfriend is just a proxy for all of the judgments he will make in life. It will never be a straight line.

Yesterday, I had to spend almost $400 on a repair, and I estimate that similar expenses will occur two to three times per year. I'm trying to determine at what point it makes sense to replace the unit. I don't yet know what a new unit will cost, but I plan to find out on Monday when the salesperson visits. Is there a formula or method for figuring out when replacement becomes more cost-effective than ongoing repairs? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Homeowner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million.

He has not proven that he can do that, so it's time for a second opinion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Homeowner, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Regular maintenance should, as any dentist will tell you, help prevent pain later on. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since your HVAC unit is 11 years old and you're spending $400 per repair two to three times a year, it's costing you $1,000 a year. So it would take 15 years to reach the $15,000 price tag of a new unit. As older units tend to fail more often, repair costs are likely to rise each year, and a major breakdown could hit you with even bigger sticker shock. If your system is more than 10 years old and annual repairs exceed $500 to $1,000 a year, start putting money aside for a replacement. From what you say, replacing the unit would be more cost-effective and less stressful. However, I'm not convinced that your maintenance man is not missing the problem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A leak of the chemical refrigerant, which is crucial for the cooling and heating process, can reduce cooling efficiency, cause the buildup of ice on coils, increase your energy costs and lead to periodic breakdowns in the entire system. Your maintenance man keeps coming back and, it seems, fixing the same problem. If there is a leak, he needs to find it. He has not proven that he can do that, so it's time for a second opinion. You should conduct maintenance on your HVAC every year, but three times a year is not sustainable. So you either find the problem and fix it or invest in a new air-conditioning unit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The silver lining, I hope, is that you can afford your heating and cooling bills. \"I dread the snow,\" a friend recently told me, because the cold temperatures mean they'll have to turn up the heat for weeks, meaning a surge in their heating bill. It can make a difference for a house with two or more bedrooms. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association recently reported that home heating costs are expected to rise 11% this winter (November through March), driven by higher energy prices. That's nearly four times the rate of inflation. (Homes that rely on electricity for their heating are predicted to rise more than those relying on natural gas.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lifespan of units </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Back to your HVAC: While some brands have better reputations than others, Constellation (CEG), the energy company, has this guide on the lifespan of units. Taking these estimates at face value, your unit should have at least another four years left, so let's assume that with a change of maintenance contractor, you will find the leak and solve the problem. Here are some lifespan estimates, according to Constellation: central air-conditioning units (12 to 17 years); heat pumps (10 to 16 years); furnaces and boilers (15 to 20 years); geothermal heat pumps (25 to 30 years); ground loops (50 years); solar panels (25 to 30 years); and evaporative coolers (5 to 15 years). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HVACs, like people, require regular tuneups. So if your unit costs you $15,000, you want to make sure it lasts as long as possible. The healthier the unit, the fewer times you will have to replace it. Those seasonal tuneups start with simple tasks like changing filters, inspecting refrigerant levels and keeping outdoor components clean, according to the experts at Constellation. Cleaning air filters removes dust, pet hair and germs, and - the best part - replacing them is inexpensive and easy. The same is true for keeping air ducts clean. To save money, put the system on \"auto\" (rather than \"all day\") and turn it off if you're going away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It is important to understand, however, that there really is no such thing as an average HVAC system,\" the company adds. \"The features and functions of different units vary tremendously. A system that only produces heat and doesn't include air conditioning will perform differently from a heat pump, for example, that does both. Usage patterns will affect how long a system might last. Heavy use will increase wear and tear and decrease a unit's lifespan. How well they are maintained can also make a difference that is measured in decades of more useful life. It is often worth paying more up front for a higher-quality unit.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Good luck with the new maintenance man in solving your temperature trouble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Can I stop my kids from using their inheritance to support political causes I vehemently oppose? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My wife's credit-card payment is three months overdue.

Physically, he is not able to live independently, but was or is pretty sharp mentally. We take care of all his bills; his house and car were sold over three years ago. His wife died in 2020; they had no children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 10 days, he started calling my sister about bills he needed to pay; all his bills are being paid by her. He also wants to know the balance in his bank accounts. My sister has always given him this information when he asks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He wanted to see the lawyer recently. He was very paranoid, asking staff to witness their conversation. He doesn't remember that he sold his house or car. In an email, his lawyer said, \"He's gone off the deep end.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lawyer's last words to us were we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate. My sister and I are his only family, the will is made and we would inherit his estate. What do we do next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Other Sibling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Sibling, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not encouraged by the tone or content of his attorney's email. It lacks compassion, professionalism and respect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother is confused and needs help. But he doesn't need an executor. An executor is appointed by the probate court after your brother passes away (and would typically be designated executor in his will). A power of attorney usually looks after a person's finances while they have diminished capacity; a durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. A conservator/guardian would be appointed by the courts to oversee his financial, physical and medical wellbeing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Take immediate steps to safeguard your brother's safety: He may need an assessment for dementia or cognitive impairment from a neurologist or geriatrician. I hope that the assisted-living facility is aware of this change of behavior, and is equipped to help him navigate this next stage. You will all need to work together until you figure out the next steps for your brother. Questions remain: What kind of power of attorney document currently exists? What legal capacity does your brother have to make decisions for himself - everything from hiring a new lawyer to revoking a POA? Has your brother been actually diagnosed with dementia? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, you will require health advocates and a competent lawyer. If the lawyer mentioned in your letter is not equipped to deal with your brother's situation - and it could be so given his reaction to the decline in your brother's health - you need a new lawyer to oversee your brother's affairs; as his joint powers of attorney, you can help him to appoint one. They will be able to help outline your options, which will depend on what kind of POA you hold and whether or not your brother requires conservatorship/guardianship, which should be a last resort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Laws regarding a conservator/guardian vary by state. In Texas, you would need to file a petition with the court. \"A hearing will be held, and the judge will examine the evidence and make a decision,\" says Childs Legacy Law Firm in Houston. \"In the second instance, absent a pending petition, and in lieu of a family member, living will or another relevant document, the court will appoint a conservator. The conservator can be any number of people, like a friend, social worker, neighbor, church member, attorney, nurse [or] another qualified person.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     General conservatorship </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A general conservatorship is created when an adult - typically an elderly person but can be a younger adult person - cannot manage their finances or health due to deteriorated mental capacity or impairment caused by an illness or injury,\" it adds. \"While they recover from the illness or injury, a conservator may be appointed by a court to address their medical and financial needs.\" Reasons include a person falling into a coma, a form of dementia like Alzheimer's, head injury or a stroke that impairs their ability to think or express their wishes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating, quite suddenly. \"People who suffer from any of the above can become vulnerable to bad actors who may try to manipulate the situation for their own financial gain. These bad actors may, for example, attempt to divert your disability payments (fraud) or coerce you into changing a will (undue influence),\" the law firm says. It is always better to draft an estate plan while you have the legal capacity to write and sign such a document. Otherwise, it will be left up to the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating. He needs calm and legal protection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, your brother needs reassurance and validation, clear and comforting communication, a routine so he feels safe, and legal protection; document everything, especially his changes in behavior. If he does not already have a healthcare proxy or healthcare power of attorney, and your brother is not of sound mind, the courts will appoint one for him. If he is in assisted living, for example, there may come a time when you will have to move him to a full-time care facility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the absence of long-term-care insurance or Medicaid, I assume you will use (or have used) the proceeds from the sale of his house to pay for his care. Selling a primary residence turns the home's equity from an exempt asset into countable cash, which often exceeds the strict monthly $2,000-$3,000 individual limit for Medicaid, which would lead to a temporary loss of benefits until those funds are spent. A trust and estate attorney can talk through your options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can do this. But you can't - nor should you - do it alone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am fearful': My ailing relative is being forced into assisted living.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Dubai International Airport in February 2021. Dubai and other airports in the region fashioned themselves into major international hubs over the years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Middle Eastern airports such as United Arab Emirates' Dubai and Qatar's Doha fashioned themselves into the crossroads of the world in the last couple of decades. Both are closed following U.S. and Israel's attacks on Iran on Saturday, wreaking havoc in international air travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dubai and Doha are among the largest international hubs for air travel, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Flights from these hubs go to all continents,\" he said. \"It's going to be highly highly disruptive to international air travelers.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel's strikes on Saturday led to Tehran's strikes of its own, with President Donald Trump calling on Iranians to overthrow their government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Aviation analytics firm Cirium said Saturday the three major airlines operating out of the UAE and Qatar - Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad - connect about 90,000 transiting passengers a day, not including passengers destined for the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several airlines canceled flights to Middle Eastern airports due to safety concerns, including United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) scratching their flights to Tel Aviv at least through the weekend, among other changes and cancellations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stephen Trent, an independent airline analyst who spent decades at major investment banks, noted that U.S. airlines already spent the last couple of years experiencing disruption in the region and already restricted their routes, which could minimize the current direct disruption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dubai's and Doha's airports were catapulted into major air-travel hubs starting in the 2000s as their own countries became global economic powerhouses. Dubai's Emirates, for instance, is one of only a select group of airlines flying Airbus' A380 jets, the largest commercial plane ever built, with room for more than 500 passengers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Historically, Iran's Mehrabad airport in Tehran was emerging as a global hub connecting East and West in the 1970s, but that trajectory cut short by the Iranian Revolution, Harteveldt said. Over the years, Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi's airports took that mantle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depending on how long the conflict and airport closures last, cargo would also be affected, Harteveldt said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even with an end to the conflict, it will take time for airlines to right their schedules and resume normal operations, since their planes - and crews - were diverted to other airports and are scattered due to the closures, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The strait is crucial because it allows cargo ships to pass the Persian Gulf,  the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the production and flow of crude oil from the Middle East. The region is home to five of the world's top 10 biggest producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"So far, there is no clarity on the magnitude of any energy disruptions, but there has been some disruption of shipping in the Strait of Hormuz,\" said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical and U.S. political strategist at BCA Research. \"It is too soon to gauge the impact on the oil market, but the intensity of the military operation implies high odds of a major oil supply disruption\" of 5 million barrels per day or more, he told MarketWatch on Saturday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel strikes on Iran targeted its leadership and military assets, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move followed failed negotiations between the U.S. and Iran to reach a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Iran has responded with strikes across the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Trump calls for regime change after U.S.-Israel attack on Iran. Markets should brace for more than June's brief military campaign. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several news reports Saturday indicated that passage through the Strait of Hormuz has been curtailed. An official from the European Union's naval mission Aspides told Reuters that vessels have been receiving VHF transmission from Iran's Revolutionary Guards saying that no ship is allowed to pass the Strait of Hormuz. So far, there has not been any official closure announcement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Iran understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports.'Stephen Innes, SPI Asset Management </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran, however, \"understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. \"It would hit not only Western consumers but also China and regional buyers. It is a blunt instrument.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Developments in the region are sure to impact oil prices as soon as trading resumes late Sunday and into early Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices will continue to rise on speculation that the war will expand and that infrastructure will be hit, said BCA Research's Gertken. U.S. global benchmark Brent crude (BRN00) could reach $90 per barrel without significant physical disruption, he said. That would be a more than 20% rise from Friday's settlement of $72.87 for the May contract (BRNK26). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If there is physical disruption, then it can rise above $100 per barrel - \"potentially well above\" that, said Gertken. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Strait of Hormuz: A staggering chokepoint </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Just how much oil could be involved when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz and to the broader region is staggering. Kpler provided a snapshot Saturday of oil and oil-product tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This map is a snapshot of the oil and oil-product tankers currently in and around the Strait Hormuz. Green tankers are loaded, while red ones are in \"ballast,\" or essentially empty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Around 20% of the global petroleum liquids the world uses transits through the strait each day. Last year, just over 14.5 million barrels per day of crude and crude condensate exports passed through the strait, said Matt Smith, U.S. head analyst at Kpler. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From the archives: Strait of Hormuz, the world's biggest oil chokepoint, in focus as U.S.-Iran tensions flare </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saudi Arabia accounted for around 5.5 million daily barrels, Iraq 3.25 million, UAE 1.97 million, Iran 1.59 million, Kuwait 1.55 million, and Qatar 0.72 million, said Smith. Over 90% of that oil typically heads to Asia, around 4% to Europe, 4% to the Americas and the rest to Africa, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Four countries - China, India, Japan and South Korea - account for nearly three-quarters of the crude barrels that pass through the Strait of Hormuz, so they would feel the most significant impact, said Smith. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Middle East is home to half of the world's top 10 oil producers - Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Kuwait, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2022, the region accounted for more than four in 10 barrels of global oil exports, it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet the oil market's biggest risk isn't the Strait of Hormuz being closed, said Kpler's Smith. It's that \"Iran's retaliation leads to broader unrest in the region, putting supply at risk,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran alone produces 3.2 million daily barrels of crude oil, with around 2 million of that primarily exported to China for refining, according to OPIS, a unit of Dow Jones, the publisher of MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran's proven crude oil reserves are estimated at 208 billion barrels, according to OPIS. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There have been reports of explosions Iran's Kharg Island, a key export terminal roughly 15 miles off the coast of Iran, OPIS's Denton Cinquegrana and Tracy Cui wrote in a report Saturday. It is still too early to tell what kind of damage, if any, has been done to export infrastructure on Kharg Island, they said, but about 90% of Iran's exports go through it. Sometimes called \"oil island,\" it has a storage capacity of about 7 million barrels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From the archives: Israeli strikes on Iran's 'oil island' could send crude prices soaring </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     OPEC+ meeting Sunday </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Iran conflict comes ahead of Sunday's monthly meeting of eight major oil producers, a group known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, or OPEC+. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The group had been raising their production quotas for most of last year, but paused those increases for the first quarter of 2026 on the heels of expectations for a global oil supply surplus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now OPEC+ is likely to increase production to \"try to suppress prices, cushion the global economy, and undercut Iranian regime funding,\" said BCA Research's Gertken.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Venessa Wong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans say politicians in Washington aren't taking the cost of living seriously </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers named grocery prices, insurance, prescription drug prices, rent and saving to buy a house as their top affordability challenges, according to an exclusive YouGov-MarketWatch survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As President Donald Trump begins his second year in office, Americans are still struggling with the cost of living. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The president campaigned on assurances that he would solve affordability challenges in 2024, and he touted his record on these issues in Tuesday's State of the Union address. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet, in a YouGov survey conducted this month exclusively for MarketWatch, nearly 47% of survey takers said affordability has worsened somewhat or a lot over the past year. Meanwhile, 36% said it has stayed about the same, and nearly 18% said affordability has improved. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers said grocery prices, insurance, prescription drug prices, rent, and saving to buy a home were the top affordability challenges. Of those who selected insurance, car insurance was the most common concern, followed by health insurance and homeowners' or renters' insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Trump says 'prices are plummeting' during SOTU. Here's what the data say. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration has lowered taxes and negotiated Medicaid and Medicare drug prices; Trump has proposed a variety of other measures - ranging from a cap on credit-card interest rates to banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet two-thirds of respondents in the YouGov-MarketWatch poll did not feel elected officials in Washington were taking affordability issues seriously. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hopefully, \"the message is finally breaking through to policymakers that affordability is the challenge of our time,\" said Catherine Harvey, a senior policy program manager in the Research to Action Lab at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research organization. Just as past policy choices have shaped the financial pressures consumers face today, future \"policy choices can relieve some of those same pressures,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Here are Trump's affordability proposals - and where they stand </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Asked who or what is most responsible for Americans' current affordability challenges, 41% of survey takers said the Trump administration was responsible, 40% said corporate greed, 22% said Republican lawmakers, 21% said the Biden administration and 20% said Democratic lawmakers (respondents could pick more than one response for this question). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Trump policies will hamstring the economy's ability to supply goods and services, and these policies aim to increase inequality by transferring income from the bottom and middle toward the top,\" according to a new report by Josh Bivens, chief economist at the  Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. This shift will happen through funding cuts for public services, including Affordable Care Act subsidies, and tax cuts favoring the rich, he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Sometimes this affordability crunch will manifest as higher prices or faster inflation, but it is more likely to appear as slower wage growth and the rollback of public supports for households,\" Bivens wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for what would improve Americans' personal financial situations, respondents primarily said lower prices (38%), higher wages (19%) and lower taxes (12%) would do the most to help them, according to the YouGov-MarketWatch poll of 1,000 people. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People's earnings have gone up since the start of Trump's first term in 2017, but \"not as fast as prices. And that's why people are feeling squeezed,\" Harvey said. In terms of public investments to relieve any of these issues, it will be important to measure what works so the government can \"invest wisely.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More on this: Here are the ideas that could really help solve America's affordability crisis in 2026 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for what would improve Americans' personal financial situations, respondents primarily said lower prices (38%) and higher wages (19%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to MarketWatch ahead of the State of the Union address, \"President Trump pledged to turn the page on Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Trump administration is embarking on an ambitious agenda of reform across every sector of our economy to deliver: from MFN [most favored nation] deals to lower drug prices to an energy abundance push to lower prices at the pump. This overarching agenda has already cooled inflation and cut prices of many household essentials, with more progress in store for the American people.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nicole Huyer, a senior research associate at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in a recent opinion piece that Trump has implemented a variety of policies - \"deregulation, tax cuts, cutting of unnecessary public workers and taxpayer-funded programs, and deportations\" - intended to reduce costs, and called them \"all steps in the right direction.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many Americans, particularly those considered to be low or middle income, face serious challenges in today's economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The gap between high-income and middle- and low-income households has continued to widen since the pandemic, according to the Bank of America Institute. Last month, lower- and middle-income households' year-over-year spending growth ticked down to 0.3% and 1.0%, respectively, while higher-income households' spending growth was more stable at 2.5%, according to Bank of America credit- and debit-card data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The number of Americans who say they don't have money left over after paying their bills rose 7 points to 48% between May and September 2025, according to Ipsos. Seven in 10 people polled by Ipsos said they were spending more on food at home and less on dining out and travel; nearly four in 10 have postponed a vacation or have delayed a big-ticket purchase such as an appliance, car or home renovation; and 30% delayed or skipped medical treatment due to cost. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As noted in an Urban Institute report, for many, \"affordability\" doesn't merely indicate an ability to spend on short-term needs and wants; it means being able to save for mid- and long-term financial goals as well. \"Young people see today's affordability crisis as a barrier to their long-term wealth-building plans, including higher education and homeownership,\" stated the report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For instance, high home prices and interest rates led the share of first-time home buyers to drop to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers reached an all-time high of 40 years old, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Among the roughly one-fourth of preretirees who said last year that they are delaying retirement, 44% cited inflation as a reason. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Who can actually buy a house today?
