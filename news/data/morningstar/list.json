            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Christine Ji and William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     American companies are spending enormous sums to develop high-performing AI models. Distillation attacks are attempting to maliciously extract them - and nobody is doing much to stop it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI race between China and the U.S. is heating up. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In January, Moonshot AI, a China-based startup seeking a $10 billion valuation, released Kimi K2.5 - an open-source large language model with coding abilities neck-to-neck with Claude Opus 4.5, which at the time was Anthropic's most advanced model. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Users of the new Moonshot model quickly noticed something fishy: Kimi K2.5 referred to itself as Claude. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Kimi-K2.5 believes it's an AI assistant named Claude,\" one user noted on social-media platform X. \"Identity crisis, or training set?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That Kimi-K2.5 called itself Claude is \"very likely\" a sign that the model was distilled from Claude outputs, according to Nathan Lambert, post-training lead at the Allen Institute for AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Indeed, the world's most high-stakes clandestine cat-and-mouse game is currently taking place in the race for artificial-intelligence supremacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this week, Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI startup, published a blog post documenting instances of distillation attacks on its models from three of China's \"AI tigers,\" alleging that the labs trained their AI using Anthropic's large language models. The Chinese labs - DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax (HK:100) - collectively used 24,000 fraudulent accounts to learn from Anthropic's Claude, according to the U.S. company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Representatives for DeepSeek, MiniMax, Moonshot AI and Anthropic did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The distillation attacks - attempts to maliciously extract the intellectual property of a high-performing AI model - come at a pivotal moment for Anthropic and the AI industry at large. Anthropic is fresh off of a new funding round that puts the startup's valuation at $380 billion. It's also dealing with the aftermath of a tense standoff with the U.S. Defense Department over how the government agency can can use its models. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Anthropic isn't the only frontier lab documenting distillation attacks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this month, both OpenAI and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google DeepMind identified an increase in model-extraction attempts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The controversy comes as it has become clear that AI is now a critical pillar of the U.S. economy and its military practices - a strategic asset for the nation on the world stage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The reported incidents flagged by Anthropic are \"only the tip of the iceberg of actual usage for this type of data generation,\" said Lambert. But it requires a lot of nuance to differentiate between a distillation attack and a company using an AI model for legitimate purposes, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Anthropic does not offer commercial access to Claude in China due to national-security reasons, according to the company. But that policy can't stop Chinese companies from accessing Claude outside of China. U.S. companies are projecting to spend trillions of dollars on AI innovation, and if Chinese labs can siphon off the technology to build comparable models for a fraction of the cost, they could render America's hardware and R&amp;D advantages marginal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The national-security dimension, the risk of frontier AI capabilities ending up in military or systems, is worth taking seriously,\" Lukasz Olejnik, independent technology consultant and visiting senior research fellow at the Department of War Studies at King's College London, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the ethics of distillation are somewhat murky given that many LLMs were trained on third-party data and copyrighted materials, often without explicit permission, Olejnik noted. And the practice of distillation is used in many nonmalicious contexts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Valid practice or violation? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Distillation has been around in some shape or form for a long time, according to Christopher Caen, CEO of Mill Pond Research. \"It's another version of scraping, which has been a problem since day one,\" Caen said, referencing how Anthropic's Claude and other LLMs have been trained on large amounts of copyrighted material from across the internet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Distillation involves training a weaker model to mimic the probability distributions of a more powerful model, often through analyzing millions of API responses to reverse engineer the \"logic\" behind the model's intelligence. The underlying technique of training a model on the outputs of another is very common for AI labs to use for internal optimization, the Allen Institute's Lambert told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Many academics and research institutes technically violate the terms of service in a strict interpretation,\" Lambert said. Anthropic itself has used distillation to create its smaller, faster models such as Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Anthropic, the three Chinese labs generated more than 16 million exchanges with Claude through unauthorized third-party API resellers. The lion's share, 13 million, was attributed to MiniMax, which says its model serves more than 212 million users and over 130,000 enterprise clients and developers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Did everyone forget about DeepSeek? What Wall Street is getting wrong about Chinese AI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Anthropic claimed another 3.4 million exchanges stemmed from Moonshot, which is backed by Chinese tech giants Tencent (HK:700) and Alibaba (BABA) (HK:9988). More than 150,000 exchanges were traced back to DeepSeek, which briefly threw U.S. AI firms into a panic last year when it debuted its R1 reasoning model. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Theo Browne, founder and CEO of the AI startup T3 Chat, told MarketWatch that 16 million exchanges is \"really not much,\" noting that his business hits that volume of usage most months. But as AI training moves beyond simple question-and-answer and toward more complex agentic workflows, companies are using large language models to generate synthetic data to train on, according to Browne and Lambert. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It wouldn't be surprising if most of them used American models for parts of their synthetic data pipelines,\" Browne said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The key difference between the actions of a company like Browne's or university researchers and those of Minimax or DeepSeek can be chalked up to a few things. Chief among them is geopolitics, according to Kyle Chan, a researcher at the Brookings Institution think tank who studies Chinese tech firms and industrial policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If they're 'cheating' off of the American models, then that means that China is able to get some kind of advantage or a leg up\" on the competition, Chan said. \"And that could challenge or threaten U.S. leadership in this space.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Olejnik, at King's College London, said that while distillation is \"routinely used to build smaller, faster and cheaper versions of existing systems,\" Anthropic and other labs are likely flagging a phenomenon where \"thousands of fake accounts circumvented access control for systematic extraction of model capabilities that took years and billions of dollars to develop.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chan said that while Chinese labs clearly use distillation as a tool to hone their models, it's likely not the only reason for their advancements. He added that some U.S. AI leaders have called technical reports released by the labs impressive, which signals that they have developed some \"fundamental capabilities.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's hard to say how much distillation matters for the Chinese AI models,\" Chan said. \"You need to have a certain level of capability in order to ... even be able to leverage that kind of data.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: How quantum computing could become the next frontier in national security </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Distillation also has potential ramifications beyond simply allowing AI labs or businesses that are not as well funded to develop comparable models. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In its blog post, Anthropic warned that foreign labs can use their distilled models to enable \"authoritarian governments\" the ability to deploy frontier AI for mass surveillance and cyberattacks. It can also make advanced AI more accessible to groups that would otherwise be incapable of committing major crimes, experts have said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"AI will probably enable relatively low-skilled cybercriminals to target firms at a higher pace and scale globally this year,\" Dragonfly, a risk-analysis and security-intelligence service owned by MarketWatch's parent company, Dow Jones, said in a report this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon Threat Intelligence (AMZN) said in a Feb. 20 report that a bad actor had used multiple AI services to compromise over 600 firewalls across dozens of countries. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And on Wednesday, cybersecurity firm Gambit Security revealed that roughly 150 gigabytes of data were stolen from 10 Mexican government bodies and a single financial institution by a hacker using Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT. It took an individual actor just a month after their initial breach to carry out the assault, according to Gambit. They relied on more than 1,000 prompts to Claude Code backed up by data analysis run by ChatGPT. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"AI didn't just assist, it functioned as the operational team: writing exploits, building tools, automating exfiltration,\" Gambit said. \"Claude executed the attack under the guidance of the attacker, and OpenAI analyzed data in support of accelerating Claude's attack-execution efforts.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The real battle is over the engine </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's stopping any AI lab - not just DeepSeek, MiniMax and Moonshot - from doing the same kind of distillation? \"Absolutely nothing,\" according to Mill Pond Research's Caen. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stopping such practices will be incredibly hard without legislation, Lambert of the Allen Institute said, which he posited could be a goal of Anthropic drawing attention to the matter. In its blog post, Anthropic said the industry would need to work with policymakers to combat widespread distillation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  02-28-26 0800ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

The Company also slashed full year 2025 expected revenue to $17 million at the midpoint, and adjusted EPS $0.50 at the midpoint.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Company further revealed that its credit loss expense for the quarter was $13,220 \"primarily [as] the result of a specific provision for expected chargebacks related to an individual merchant in the Merchant Solutions segment.\" The report revealed write-offs of $9,924 \"driven by the write off of irrecoverable amounts receivable in the Merchant Solutions segment.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">On the same date, the Company held an earnings call during which CEO Bruce Lowthers revealed the Company \"had a last-minute client that had to shut down that caused several million-dollar write-down in Q3.\" Lowthers further revealed the Company is in a market tier with \"higher risk MCC [Merchant Category Codes] codes.\" Lowthers explained \"those things sometimes are a little difficult to bank\" and \"sometimes the banks aren't open to the additional risk\" \"so, we've had a little bit of challenge with that with some of those MCC codes.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">On this news, Paysafe's stock price fell $2.80, or 27.6%, to close at $7.36 per share on November 13, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary and Philip van Doorn </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of PayPal and Block are both cheap relative to historic levels, but only one of them commands heavy enthusiasm from analysts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     PayPal and Block are examples of financial-technology stocks trading at low price-to-earnings ratios relative to their three-year average valuations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Financial-technology stocks have been battered in recent years - and now may be worth a fresh look. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Global X FinTech ETF FINX has fallen 48% over the past five years, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has risen 80% and the S&amp;P 500 financials sector XX:SP500.40 has increased 59%. Analysts now see plenty of opportunity in the fintech sector, particularly as valuations have come down for some high-profile names. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Recent actions in the payment-technology industry suggest that major players are getting more serious about improving operating performance. Block (XYZ), the parent of Square and Cash App, said this week that it would slash more than 40% of its workforce in a bid to drive operational efficiencies and reduce organizational friction. Management said that artificial-intelligence tools are driving major productivity benefits that will enable the company to do more with less. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Block says AI will allow it to cut more than 4,000 jobs. Some argue that's not the whole story. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block CFO Amrita Ahuja told MarketWatch that the move came from a \"position of strength,\" as the company simultaneously announced fourth-quarter results that exceeded the consensus view. But the reality is that Block shares have plunged 77% from their 2021 peak, as pricey acquisitions have failed to yield commensurate financial benefits and as fintech valuations have receded from pandemic-era levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In turn, the stock's valuation is now more compelling. As of Friday's close, Block was trading at 17.4-times estimated earnings per share over the next 12 months, according to LSEG data. That valuation compares with a three-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 24.2 for its stock. Block is heavily favored by analysts working for brokerage and research firms polled by LSEG, as you can see below. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Then there's PayPal Holdings (PYPL), which in early February announced that Enrique Lores, formerly of HP (HPQ), would be taking over as CEO after prior turnaround attempts failed to manifest quickly enough. Critics have noted that PayPal underinvested in its core business, ceded its first-mover advantages to Apple Pay (AAPL) and moved too slowly with its push to monetize Venmo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some analysts are now intrigued by the possibility of a breakup or outright sale of the company. Lores doesn't exactly have a payments-sector background, but PayPal called him the \"lead architect\" of the 2015 split of HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). And Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that multiple entities have expressed early interest in buying either parts of the company or all of it. PayPal declined to comment on those talks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: PayPal's stock pops on takeover hopes. Here's who could swoop in with a purchase. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Off 85% from their 2021 peak, PayPal shares sport a potentially compelling forward P/E valuation of 8.6, compared with a three-year average valuation of 12.4. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Then again, Wall Street analysts aren't enthusiastic about PayPal, even at the current low P/E level: Only 10 out of 45 analysts polled by LSEG who cover the company rate the stock a buy or the equivalent. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Could Stripe 'salvage' PayPal? What Wall Street has to say about the latest takeover talk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For more perspective on the valuations, the S&amp;P 500 trades at a forward P/E of 21.6, while its financial sector trades at a forward P/E of 15.3. Payment-processing stalwarts Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), which have competitive moats and enviable profit margins, trade at respective P/E valuations of 23.6 and 25.7. Those are well below the three-year average forward P/Es of 27.6 for Visa and 31 for Mastercard. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors have been worried about a laundry list of issues, including regulatory changes, economic prospects and whether there's simply much more room to convert cash-based payments over to cards. The stocks even got hit in the wake of Citrini Research's viral blog post floating a futuristic scenario in which AI-fueled stablecoins disrupt established payment networks and AI-driven productivity boosts force mass underemployment, leaving knowledge workers with less money to spend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The sad truth in this market is also that if you have to say 'xyz is not an AI loser but a winner,' then you have already lost (at least the debate),\" Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. But she also noted that Mastercard and Visa have \"two-sided networks across billions of consumers and hundreds of millions of merchants\" that confer major incumbency advantages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: How to play payments stocks after essentially their worst run in 15 years </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch conducted a broader screen of fintech stocks to assess which are most favored by analysts.

Developed as a greenfield hospitality project, Le Tesserae reflects a growing national shift away from standardized hotel ballrooms toward architecturally distinctive environments designed to create more meaningful and immersive guest experiences.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For decades, hotel ballrooms have served as the default infrastructure for weddings, corporate gatherings, and private events. Yet as hospitality has evolved, many of these spaces, built primarily for scale and operational efficiency, have become increasingly commoditized, offering limited architectural identity or emotional resonance. Le Tesserae was conceived as a direct response to this shift: a venue designed not simply to accommodate events, but to elevate them through architectural character that evoke strong feelings.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Located at 2990 Clinton Drive, minutes from downtown Houston, Le Tesserae was developed over a multi-year period with a singular guiding principle - that hospitality environments should be built with the permanence and material integrity traditionally reserved for cultural and civic architecture.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Guests arrive through a grand reception lobby anchored by a hand-laid mosaic floor composed of millions of individual tiles, each placed to create a surface that feels both intricate and timeless. Overhead, custom crown moldings and architectural detailing establish an immediate sense of permanence and craftsmanship. This arrival sequence was intentionally designed to create a gradual transition from the exterior urban environment into a fully immersive architectural interior.</p><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/ada688bb-e9b6-4827-9256-e487d696e7fc/image20260228122107sw51uq.png\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/ada688bb-e9b6-4827-9256-e487d696e7fc/1142520/image20260228122107sw51uq.png\"/></picture></span></a><span> </span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Beyond the lobby, the main ballroom unfolds beneath soaring ceilings and dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows that frame unobstructed views of Houston's skyline and the surrounding natural landscape of Buffalo Bayou. Natural light moves dynamically through the space throughout the day, while seamless transitions between the ballroom, wraparound balcony, and covered outdoor terraces create a continuous dialogue between interior architecture and the surrounding environment.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Inspired by European historic spaces and informed by the partners' international travels, Le Tesserae incorporates custom millwork, handmade detailing, and layered architectural finishes designed to conjure the character of longstanding institutions. The result is a newly constructed venue that carries the visual weight and authenticity of a space that has existed for centuries, an increasingly rare quality in modern hospitality development.<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/> </p><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/2904c3ad-71f6-4a1c-9d02-921da122e914/1142520/image.jpeg\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/2904c3ad-71f6-4a1c-9d02-921da122e914/1142520/image.jpeg\"/></picture></span></a><span> </span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Complementing the main venue is an adjacent 5,000-square-foot rooftop bar, offering panoramic views of the Houston skyline and introducing an open-air dimension to the property. The rooftop allows hosts to design multi-layered experiences, ranging from welcome receptions and cocktail hours to after-parties and private gatherings, within a single cohesive destination. This layered spatial composition reflects evolving guest expectations, where movement between environments contributes to the overall experiential narrative.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Le Tesserae represents the latest development from Kapadia and Pachioli, whose hospitality portfolio spans multiple venues, culinary concepts, and experiential destinations operated under a single umbrella. Over more than a decade, the partners have built their platform with a consistent focus on creating environments where architectural design and guest experience are inseparable.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Our intention with Le Tesserae was to create something enduring,\" said Kapadia. \"We wanted to build a space defined by craftsmanship and permanence, an environment that feels timeless and elevates the experience of gathering.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Pachioli added, \"There is a growing recognition that the physical environment plays a central role in how people experience important moments. Le Tesserae reflects our belief that hospitality spaces should be designed with the same care, intention, and architectural integrity as the experiences they host.\"<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/> </p><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/40bff3c6-c554-41a0-9d75-8ed5c470a935/image202602281221071ajbgt.png\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/40bff3c6-c554-41a0-9d75-8ed5c470a935/1142520/image202602281221071ajbgt.png\"/></picture></span></a><span> </span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Kapadia and Pachioli began developing their hospitality platform by identifying an opportunity to create event environments that moved beyond the limitations of traditional venues. After raising outside capital during the company's launch, the partners later reacquired full ownership of their business to pursue long-term independent development aligned with their architectural vision.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic shortly thereafter created one of the most disruptive periods in modern hospitality history, halting operations across the industry. Rather than retreat, Kapadia and Pachioli continued investing in development and infrastructure, advancing Le Tesserae as a reflection of their conviction in experiential hospitality's long-term evolution.</p><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/84d2632b-04e1-4c18-8524-3cd9f8fa773d/1142520/image20260228122107mvajit.jpeg\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/84d2632b-04e1-4c18-8524-3cd9f8fa773d/1142520/image20260228122107mvajit.jpeg\"/></picture></span></a><span> </span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The completion of Le Tesserae comes amid growing national demand for architecturally distinctive hospitality environments that offer differentiation beyond standardized event infrastructure.

The Company's registration statement emphasized its plans to develop a large electric generation campus for AI data centers and identified an investment-grade \"First Tenant\" for its Project Matador site. The registration statement stated that, on September 19, 2025, Fermi had entered into a letter of intent with the First Tenant to lease a portion of the site on a triple-net basis for an initial twenty-year term, with four five-year renewal options.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In November 2025, the Company further announced that the First Tenant had entered into an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement agreeing, subject to conditions, to advance up to $150 million toward construction costs.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">On December 12, 2025, Fermi disclosed that the First Tenant had terminated the AICA the prior day, eliminating a key funding arrangement for the Project. Although Fermi stated that lease negotiations continued under the letter of intent, the market reacted negatively, and Fermi's stock price fell more than 33%, closing at $10.09 per share, well below the IPO price.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Greg Robb </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Experts see high potential for a military strike </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump greets members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as he arrives to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With oil prices rising in response to growing tensions with Iran, the rationale for additional interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve is disappearing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The argument for having lower rates is just evaporating right before our very eyes,\" said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, in an interview. The uptick in oil prices combined with the Trump administration's aggressive approach to tariffs is putting upward pressure on inflation, complicating any Fed rate cut, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the past several months, the Fed has struggled to tamp down inflation amid pressure from the White House and the markets to cut rates. These latest developments only add to the central bank's challenges. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prices at the wholesale level started to accelerate in December and are running at a 3% annual rate, frustrating Federal Reserve officials who hoped that the taxes on imports would only have a transitory impact on inflation. It's likely that the increase in producer prices will soon be passed on to consumers, said Ethan Harris, former chief economist at BofA Securities, in a note on LinkedIn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation is looking like it is heating up in the first quarter, agreed Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. Core personal-consumption expenditures could rise to 3.1% annual rate in January, the highest rate in two years - and that's before any impact from a potential U.S. strike on Iran. The Fed's target for inflation is 2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Any $10 increase in crude-oil prices is estimated to raise consumer-price inflation by 0.2% to 0.4% over the coming year, Anderson said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     WTI crude-oil futures (CL00) (CLJ26) are up about 16% year to date, or $10 per barrel since the beginning of the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Just the growing risk of a conflict with Iran is already impacting energy markets and prices, adding to U.S. inflation pressures and creating major headwinds for further Fed rate cuts,\" Anderson said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A prolonged conflict might raise the possibility that the central bank's next move would be to raise interest rates, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You're really talking about problems for the Fed in terms of putting a lid on inflation,\" Bethune said. \"In this situation, the Fed can't lower rates.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Traders in derivate markets still expect two quarter-point rate cuts this year, with the first coming in June and the second in September. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Both tariffs and oil prices are supply shocks, raising the costs of inputs into production of the economy, which are very hard for the Fed to cool. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed's interest-rate tool works more on the demand side of the economy, by either spurring companies and consumers to spend or nudging them to pull back. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Military action in Iran is likely, analysts say </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices are expected to spike if there is any attack on Iran, with the only debate about how long the higher prices might last. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts see a very high potential for some kind of military strike on Iran in the coming weeks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There has been a \"slow-motion effort\" to get U.S. military assets in the Middle East region since January, said Suzanne Maloney, director of the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. military action against Iran \"seems more likely than not,\" said Christopher Granville, managing director of TS Lombard, a macroeconomic forecasting consultancy firm based in London. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Granville said a military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran is unlikely to send the global economy into a full-blown oil crisis and stagflationary shock. Still, it's possible we'll face an \"oil squall\" similar to what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, when oil prices surged over $100 a barrel and remained high for six months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That so-called squall was enough to fuel inflation in the U.S., with the core PCE price index rising at an annual pace of 5.6% in September 2022, the highest rate in almost 40 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, many economists say it's hard to forecast the future in the Middle East and how any confrontation would impact oil prices. Bank analysts still expect 2026 average prices to remain around the low $60-a-barrel range. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Karen Young, senior research scholar at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, said any price spike depends on whether the Iranian regime strikes oil-production facilities of its neighbors in the Middle East in response to U.S. action. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran also has the ability to disrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial maritime passage connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, thinks it is likely that Iran tries to hit its neighbors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Iranian government's conclusion is that if President Trump calculates that war is cost-free, \"he's going to continue doing it,\" Nasr said during a discussion of the conflict earlier this week sponsored by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Greg Robb </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
