            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Morey Stettner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taxes, investments, healthcare - everything adds up. Here's how to plan now to relocate later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The financial planning strategies you followed in America may no longer work as intended after you relocate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide to retire abroad, impulsivity works against you. Abruptly uprooting your life can expose you to financial (and emotional) shocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's better to plan ahead. \"People underestimate all the pieces that come into play,\" said Brett Bernstein, a certified financial planner in Bethesda, Md. \"The goal is to make sure they have the income they want to live off of.\" That takes months, even years, of research and preparation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Start early in figuring out where to go. Visit your top-tier destinations and consider the impact of inflation and taxes in those countries. \"Identify the income-tax rules in the country and in the local province where you might move,\" Bernstein said. \"What's the local sales tax? What other taxes are there?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From his experience advising clients who retire abroad, some Americans assume \"it'll be cheaper to live over there.\" The figure they can sell their U.S. house at a big profit, rent abroad and live happily ever after. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The challenge is accurately projecting the cost of living, especially nondiscretionary expenses (rent, taxes, insurance, etc.) in a new home. Advisers often use financial-planning software to map out scenarios that include currency swings, taxes and investment options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After deciding on a foreign destination, it's best to hire an international-tax adviser who specializes in tax laws in that country. Relocation consultants or attorneys can also help anticipate and address legal and logistical issues. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Portfolio shifts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Managing long-term currency risk plays a key role. Unfavorable exchange rates can erode spending power in the years after a move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Similarly, it's good to diversify investment portfolios to include stocks and bonds issued in the future home country. That's vital if it's a permanent move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Having international diversification in place is important,\" said Shane Cummings, a Denver-based certified financial planner. \"Beyond that, the most important thing you can do before moving abroad is to look into tax implications because [foreign] tax treaties can be complex. On the investment side, portfolio income can be taxed differently and that can lead you to make investment changes now.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Financial-planning strategies that worked in America may no longer work as intended after relocation. For example, some countries tax distributions from a Roth IRA - as well as taxing other sources of income from the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While planning well in advance of a move makes sense, risks abound. A stable country can be rocked by political instability. American retirees can quickly find themselves on the outside looking in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Don't assume today's dream destination will welcome Americans well into the future,\" said David A. Schneider, a New York City-based certified financial planner. \"There's a risk of backlash if lots of Americans stream into that country.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spain and Portugal, for instance, remain popular choices for American retirees. But their residency and language requirements are tightening up, along with property-investment restrictions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may be necessary to sever ties to well-liked financial advisers or brokerage accounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you become a permanent resident abroad, you'll need to find new financial [institutions] to work with you because the U.S. financial system will largely be cut off from you, even if the country is a strong U.S. ally,\" Schneider said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. financial custodians, such as banks and brokerages, have strict rules about continuing to serve Americans who relocate abroad. Increasingly, they are terminating accounts once they learn an American customer has left the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Your ability to invest in the U.S. can end without a legal U.S. address,\" said Mike Delgass, a New York City-based adviser. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare concerns </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n      If you move abroad, you will lose almost all your Medicare coverage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare is another factor that can affect a retiree's nest egg. Retirees abroad will lose almost all Medicare coverage. \"So you need to figure out how you'll fund healthcare in that country,\" Delgass said. \"It's a new expense for retirees to plan for. You may need private-pay or supplemental [health] insurance. Some countries subsidize it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And for those indecisive or prone to changing minds at the last minute, retiring abroad gets tougher and potentially more costly. Laying the groundwork methodically - researching costs and benefits and enlisting experts to ease the transition - works better for those sure they have found the right spot to retire. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Said Delgass: \"The worst thing is to do a ton of financial planning and then choose the wrong place.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: You can find quality, affordable healthcare if you retire abroad. Here's where to look. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: U.S. passport power plunges - and 'worried' Americans are searching for second passports and golden visas </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Morey Stettner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     State jobless claims point to a soft-but-stable labor market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S.-based online retailing giant Amazon said it is eliminating 14,000 jobs to streamline its operations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon's plans to discard at least 14,000 employees and the elimination of 48,000 jobs at UPS suggest layoffs in the U.S. are on the rise, but there's just one problem: There's little evidence to support it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A spate of high-profile corporate layoff announcements in recent days has sparked talk on whether the end of the \"low-fire, low-hire\" labor market is here. If so, it could be an ominous sign for the U.S. economy, which has been made more vulnerable due to trade wars and a government shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Normally, economists would verify their suspicions through the weekly jobless claims report, which shows how many people apply for unemployment benefits. They'd also look at a monthly report on total layoffs. Both reports have been suspended during the federal lockdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a backdoor route to detecting changes in layoff trends, though. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The data on unemployment filings compiled by the states are not just sent to the federal government. They are also available on nearly all the state-government websites with a short delay. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What have they shown? The number of new jobless claims remains in the low 200,000s, and they haven't really changed since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the seven days ending Oct. 25, U.S. jobless claims were at an estimated 220,000 after seasonal adjustments, according to calculations by Citi Research. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Initial jobless claims totaled 218,000 in the week before the shutdown began, Wall Street DJIA SPX firms estimate based on state data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Jobless claims data continue to point to the low firing and low hiring dynamic persisting in the labor market in October,\" Citi economists wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A look at some of the largest states also suggests the labor market is stable. New jobless claims in California, for instance, totaled 40,731 last week - basically unchanged since the start of the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If scores of big companies made large layoffs announcements like Amazon (AMZN) or UPS (UPS), the outlook for the labor market could darken. But it really hasn't been the case. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Despite some recent high-profile layoff announcements, initial claims for now remain consistent with a low pace of job losses,\" said Nancy Van Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's also important to consider is how many layoffs take place each year in a gigantic economy like the United States. The Amazon and UPS job reductions, as large as they seem, would barely make a dent in jobless claims. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consider that some 11.5 million new jobless claims were filed in 2024. The job cuts by Amazon and UPS would amount to just 0.6 percentage points of all layoffs last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jobless claims don't even reveal the full scope of the rapid churn in the U.S. labor market. Many people who lose jobs don't apply for benefits, either because they might not be eligible or because they find a new job quickly. Some might also decide to retire or stay out of the workforce. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More broadly, layoffs in the U.S. topped 19.2 million in 2024, based on another government report on job openings and job losses. Most of the people who lost jobs ended up working somewhere else. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The job cuts at Amazon and UPS also have to be put into context. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon, for instance, also reduced its workforce by 27,000 employees in 2022 - but those layoffs didn't make a dent in weekly jobless claims. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How come? The layoffs were spread out, for one thing, and many former employees quickly found work at a time when demand for labor was high and the unemployment rate was at a 55-year low of 3.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The UPS job cuts, for their part, actually started early this year. Some 34,000 of the 48,000 layoffs have already taken place and would have been counted in weekly jobless-claims reports before the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So the labor market is just fine, then?  Not necessarily. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The recent layoff announcements could be the tip of the iceberg. Job creation in the U.S. has also nearly ground to a halt since the spring, and many companies have said they plan to scale back hiring plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If the economy were to slow even further, businesses could lay off more workers to offset a decline in sales and profits. Companies could also try to save on tariff costs by reducing labor expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But for now, there's still no sign of a major surge in layoffs or a rapid rise in unemployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Over the past five years, despite increasing external shocks, China has maintained an average annual growth rate of around 5.5 percent, contributing approximately 30 percent to global growth.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Sevim Dagdelen, a German politician and a member of the Bundestag, said China has always advocated building an open and inclusive Asia-Pacific cooperation framework and upholding the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, which plays a positive role in promoting regional and even global economic stability.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">'Right path forward'</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As Xi described, the world today stands at \"a new crossroads\" between cooperation and hegemonism. In this context, he called on all economies to strengthen solidarity, reject protectionism, resist unilateralism and work together to build an Asia-Pacific community so as to further boost peace and development in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To guide such cooperation, Xi outlined five proposals at his Session I speech: upholding the multilateral trading system, fostering an open regional economy, safeguarding industrial and supply chain resilience, advancing digital and green trade, and promoting inclusive development that benefits all.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">These ideas are already taking shape. China-initiated platforms such as the APEC Port Network and Green Supply Chain Network have become vital hubs for digitalized and sustainable trade across the region. Over the past five years, China has ranked first in global goods trade and second in services trade, attracting more than $700 billion in foreign investment and maintaining outbound investment growth above 5 percent annually.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">China's technological collaboration continues to empower Asia-Pacific and global partners - from smart ports in Latin America and mobile payment systems in Southeast Asia to AI-powered efficiency projects in the Middle East and electric vehicle production in Thailand. Together, these examples form a mosaic of shared progress grounded in openness and innovation.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Public sentiment mirrors this vision. A recent CGTN poll found that 83.2 percent of respondents across the Asia-Pacific expressed confidence in regional integration, while 84.6 percent agreed that economies should uphold multilateralism and globalization.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As China prepares to host APEC for the third time next year, its message remains clear and forward-looking.

The two oils often move in tandem due to their use in similar products. While increased soybean oil supply could weigh on demand for crude palm oil, firm biodiesel demand under Indonesia's B50 mandate, seasonal monsoon-related production slowdown and lower Malaysian inventories should limit downside risks.
