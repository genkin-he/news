A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 8, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Marex sold over-the-counter financial instruments to itself; (2) Marex had inconsistencies in its financial statements between its subsidiaries and related parties, including as to intercompany receivables and loans; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Marex's financial statements could not be relied upon; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Marex's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Marex class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547158-1&amp;h=891133420&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D43100&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D43100\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43100</a> call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Naeem Aslam </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Structural problems including high debt levels, deficits and geopolitical risks remain </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weakness in the short term doesn't end the bullish case for gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although I have an overall positive view on gold (GC00) as an investment, it may have peaked for the year. At the same time, I wouldn't view the current correction as an alarm to sell out of gold altogether. Instead, it's an opportunity, a prime moment for long-term investors to extend an investment or to average in, given that the fundamental long-term thesis has been validated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's important for investors to keep in mind that short-term market fluctuations driven by investment headlines and central banks need not factor into an investor's long-term perspective. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Decoding headlines and market sentiment </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although relief from market uncertainty seems possible due to the positive attitudes toward U.S.-China trade talks, gold nonetheless responds to central-bank actions. This week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting may be the most important factor influencing gold's medium-term trajectory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The financial markets now expect a 25-basis-point cut to the Fed's benchmark interest rate, but it's important to focus on the guidance that Fed Chair Jerome Powell provides. Will the Fed have a dovish bias on inflation and interest rates, or become more cautious? The information that has come in - such as lower inflation data and lower manufacturing data in the central bank's 12 regions - has boosted the dovish camp. But markets may change course relatively quickly if the Fed's guidance shifts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In such a situation, this correction in gold may become an investment opportunity. Gold prices tend to rise as the yield curve eases and the returns on alternative investments become less lucrative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It is also important to keep in mind that most of the recent data released are still coming out under the limitations of the U.S. government shutdown - so be careful in reading those numbers or forming an opinion based on them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The experts who previously warned against gold as an inflation hedge now argue there's room to grow </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Broader buying opportunity </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The overall macroeconomic environment encourages long-term investment in gold. Structural problems including high debt levels, deficits and geopolitical risks remain. The latest actions by the U.S. government include placing tariffs on Chinese goods and additional sanctions against officials in China's Ministry of State Security, as well as assessing Chinese compliance with various agreements. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although some indicators point toward moderation, like deceleration of inflation levels (keeping in mind that such data are affected by the U.S. government shutdown), the political and economic climate overall is turbulent. These conflicting signals highlight gold's significance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From a technical perspective, gold now looks oversold. We are likely to see prices moving back up in the short term before the correction continues - if it continues. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Based on these factors, it seems that the most sensible decision for investors now would be to look at the recent correction as an opportunity to buy. It's always sound strategy to realize gains should you be heavily positioned, but I wouldn't advocate liquidating your entire investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If Fed exhibits dovish statements - either by cutting rates or being quite accommodative in its statements - it would not be long before gold rallies. But if the central bank makes less dovish statements than expected, it may keep gold prices momentarily dormant. Still, the underlying case for gold remains intact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weakness in the short term doesn't end the bullish case for gold. The trick is to position perfectly by locking in some profits and being ready to add to positions on dips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Naeem Aslam is chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets in London. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Why I'm buying more gold </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: The Fed has a strong case for an October rate cut - but investors should brace for anything </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Naeem Aslam </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The Inclusive Growth Score (IGS) provides local partners, policymakers, community leaders and impact investors with a clear, simple view of social and economic indicators at the neighborhood level. These results help them understand what's working and what needs help.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Using the Inclusive Growth Score platform, teams will analyze data related to housing affordability, small business growth, health coverage, and early education enrollment to uncover patterns and design interventions. Proposed solutions may range from policy recommendations and workforce development programs to AI-powered digital tools that promote equitable growth.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Students will apply data science techniques — including statistical modeling, visualization, and predictive analytics — to uncover insights and propose solutions that promote economic equity, workforce growth, and community resilience.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Throughout the challenge, teams will participate in virtual workshops, mentorship sessions, and in-person pitch stops at partner HBCUs, including Alabama A&amp;M University, Jackson State University, Fisk University. Upcoming stops include: Bowie State University(11/13), and Grambling State University(11/20). The competition will culminate in the Finalist Showcase and Awards Ceremony, held from December 4 to 6, 2025, at Mastercard's Atlanta headquarters, where top teams will present their findings to corporate and community leaders. A total of $52,400 in cash prizes will be awarded, including a $15,000 grand prize for the first-place team.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information about the 2025 Mastercard Data Challenge, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547269-1&amp;h=1675153886&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdatascience.aucenter.edu&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fdatascience.aucenter.edu\" tabindex=\"0\">https://datascience.aucenter.edu</a> or contact Jamal Ware at <span class=\"mdc-article-underline\" data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:jware@aucenter.edu\" tabindex=\"0\">jware@aucenter.edu</a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About the AUC Data Science Initiative</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">The Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative (AUC DSI) serves as a hub for data science education, research, and collaboration across Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Morehouse School of Medicine. Through partnerships with industry leaders such as Mastercard, Google, and UnitedHealth Group, the initiative builds student pipelines into data-driven careers while ensuring HBCU representation in the evolving tech and analytics landscape.</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL13049&amp;sd=2025-11-01\"/></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atlanta-university-center-consortium-and-mastercard-partner-to-launch-2025-data-challenge-empowering-hbcu-students-to-drive-inclusive-growth-302601545.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atlanta-university-center-consortium-and-mastercard-partner-to-launch-2025-data-challenge-empowering-hbcu-students-to-drive-inclusive-growth-302601545.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Atlanta University Center Consortium</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account. I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I have a considerable amount of unrealized capital gains in this fund and can't decide whether selling some or all of it and paying the taxes makes sense, or if I should wait through the coming decline.

Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported their quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm.

Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, it's probably better the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Why are we normalizing $20 lunches?!\" Workers balk at the surging price of the midday meal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average weekly tab for lunch is now $108.68, according to a new survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Has lunch become a luxury item? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's the question many are asking in light of rising prices for food in general - and dining out in particular. And it's something borne out by a new survey from ezCater, a food-focused tech platform, that shows Americans are now spending $108.68 each week on their Monday-through-Friday lunches. That's up from $88.44 a year ago - a spike of more than $20. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The survey, which encompassed 1,000 full-time U.S. employees, also notes that 51% of workers said they skip lunch once a week. And while work factors play into this - meaning people are sometimes too busy at their jobs to grab a bite - 17% of those surveyed said they forego the midday meal to save money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even those who do have lunch are making accommodations to counter rising costs, with 33% saying they are buying lunch out less frequently and 18% saying they're opting for smaller portions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But you don't have to take the survey's word for it. Just ask most anyone who's looked at their lunch tab lately. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Andrew Hickey, who runs a media-relations company based in the New York metro area, says he goes out for lunch a few times a week. His tab easily runs $18, even for just a bowl of greens, he notes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Salad has become expensive, especially if you're adding protein to it,\" Hickey said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He added that he's learned to avoid delivery because it can jack up the price considerably when factoring in the fees and tip. Suddenly, a lunchtime burrito costs $25, Hickey notes. \"That's when it really shocked me,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Such sentiment is echoed throughout social media. On one TikTok video, someone questions: \"Why are we normalizing $20 lunches?!?!\" On another (expletive-filled) one, someone similarly declares: \"How the f- are we supposed to afford lunch at the office? Like, every fast-casual place around here is $19 for a bowl of slop.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But restaurateurs say they don't have much choice: The cost of doing business is such that they have to charge what they charge. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alex Compton, owner of Compton's Sandwich Shop, a growing chain with locations in New York and New Jersey, points to the fact his costs for protein items (as in meat) have increased 20% in the past year, while his costs for produce are up by 14%. He tries to keep prices low, but his sandwiches can still run to $18, which can become a challenge for some customers, he admits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're at a threshold here,\" said Compton of the current state of lunch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Compton has rolled out a daily $16.95 lunch special, which includes a sandwich, drink and chips, to ease the burden and keep customers coming back. He's not alone in that regard; many restaurant chains, especially in the fast-food and fast-casual sectors, have done the same. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most notably, McDonald's (MCD), which has faced criticism for higher prices in the last few years, recently rolled out a series of deals, including $8 \"Extra Value Meals.\" In a statement, Joe Erlinger, president of U.S. McDonald's operations, said the chain is \"laser-focused on delivering value and affordability for our customers.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Certainly, consumers can take advantage of such savings. Others are finding different ways to lower their lunch burden, especially by preparing their meals at home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And some are turning to MealPal, a subscription service that offers savings of up to several dollars per lunch through restaurants in the 20 cities it services. The growing company, which is privately held, doesn't reveal how many subscribers it has, but says tens of thousands of lunches are ordered on its platform each day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One final option: Companies can provide lunch for their employees for free or at a subsidized cost. Experts say this could become more commonplace, given the need to hire or retain top talent and the fact lunch is becoming an increasing financial burden for workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Steve Zagor, a food-industry consultant who also teaches at Columbia University, is among those who think companies will have to embrace this idea. Otherwise, workers could be left hungry - and unhappy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Plus, Zagor reminds us that from a dietary standpoint, lunch is often considered the most important meal of the day. There's a reason why many Europeans focus heavily on midday dining. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you're going to have a big meal, it's better to have it at lunch,\" Zagor said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

During the third quarter, Berkshire's stock advanced 3.5%, about half the gain seen for the S&amp;P 500 over that period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We believe that CEO-designate Greg Abel will restore investorconfidence over time.
