            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Alessandra Malito </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never been a generation like the baby boomers - and there probably never will be again </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For many members of the baby-boomer generation, personal finances have improved with time and asset appreciation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Baby boomers seemed to have it easier than other generations: They benefited from the postwar economic boom, had access to affordable higher education and workplace pensions, and found success in real estate and the stock market - and then didn't share the wealth with subsequent generations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New research has found there's some truth to that narrative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Boomers have been more financially comfortable than their predecessors during the same times of life, and if the trends continue, they'll be better off than at least one generation after them, too: Generation X. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For many members of the baby-boomer generation, who were born between 1946 and 1964, their personal finances have improved with time and asset appreciation. Baby boomers, the oldest of whom are turning 80 this year, have watched home prices soar after getting into the housing market at young age. And while they've weathered market volatility and downturns, their investments have climbed through the decades. They're also more educated than their older counterparts, which lends itself to higher wages, experts note. And for them, higher education was cheaper: The average cost of tuition at a public college is up more than 300% since 1963. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A few things worked in boomers' favor,\" said Richard Fry, senior researcher on the social and demographics trends team at Pew Research Center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The steep price of housing is forcing Americans to delay marriage, kids and other milestones </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the time the cohort had reached the ages of 58 to 76 in 2022, the median wealth of baby-boomer households was $432,200, compared with $335,900 for the Silent Generation in 2001, and $185,300 for the Greatest Generation before them in 1983, according to a recent Pew Research Center report that adjusted for inflation as of 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, some baby boomers are significantly better off than their peers; those with bachelor's degrees were wealthier than those with lower levels of education. The top 10% of baby-boomer households held almost three-quarters of the $77 trillion in wealth the generation holds, the research showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, even with more degrees under their belts, the generations younger than the baby boomers are still finding their footing as they plan for retirement. Americans' median retirement savings, when accounting just for people with any retirement savings, was $40,000, according to the National Institute of Retirement Security. When also factoring in American workers without retirement savings, the median amount is $955. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Though boomers' financial well-being blossomed over the decades, their children did not necessarily benefit as a result. Gen X might have it the hardest right now: The so-called slacker generation, born between 1965 and 1980, entered the labor force at a time when defined-benefit pensions began to dissolve and companies placed the responsibility of saving for old age on workers, with the advent of the 401(k). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They've also been caring for both aging loved ones and young or adult children who leave the nest later than the generations before them. Gen X-ers will be retiring around the same time Social Security's trust funds are expected to run out of money, at which point beneficiaries would see a roughly 20% cut to benefits if Congress does not act. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Gen X is living in the perfect storm for their retirement and overall wealth building,\" said Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of Transamerica Institute and its Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Millennials and Gen Z-ers, meanwhile, might have brighter futures. The younger the generation, the more likely they are to start preparing for retirement sooner. The median age when baby boomers started saving for retirement was 35, compared with 30 for Gen X, 25 for millennials and 20 for Gen Z, Collinson said. \"It offers them a greater time horizon for their savings to compound and grow,\" she noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the future is uncertain, Pew's Fry said. Younger generations have attained higher levels of education than their older counterparts, but it's a guess as to how market volatility, home prices, wage growth and other economic aspects of society could evolve over the next few decades. While their overall better education should work in their favor, Fry said, \"it's hard to make predictions about assets and incomes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Alessandra Malito </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Joy Wiltermuth and Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The next 24 to 48 hours of conflict will be crucial for markets after the U.S. and Israel launched military strikes against Iran </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. markets are on edge after the U.S. and Israel's attack on Iran prompted Tehran to respond with strikes in the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel attacked Iran, leading Tehran to quickly retaliate with strikes within Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East after President Donald Trump called on Iranians to take over their government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those developments have raised questions about whether this conflict will last longer - and risk sweeping up more oil-producing nations - than the brief U.S.-Israel military operation in June targeting Tehran's nuclear facilities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This is different,\" said Ali Meli, founder and chief investment officer at Monachil Capital Partners, in a Saturday interview with MarketWatch. \"There's a belief that this may be more aimed at regime change, beyond nuclear deterrence.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     '[T]he question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical.'Ali Meli, Monachil Capital Partners </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now, the question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical,\" said Meli. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens in the next 24 to 48 hours may provide clues to the potential scope of this conflict and its likely impact on markets, with Iran's oil infrastructure and the region's Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, now a major focus. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. There were reports Saturday of Iran threatening to limit passage through the waterway. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes were nearing, as Trump suggested to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The brief June 2025 conflict is a poor guide to what is likely to follow,\" said Nick Redman, analyst at Oxford Analytica, a geopolitical risk-analysis and advisory service owned by MarketWatch publisher Dow Jones. \"Then, Iran sought to avoid confrontation because it understood U.S. objectives were limited, meaning that regional relations and wider international legitimacy were worth preserving.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, however, Iran might look to \"hunker down or seek to draw out any conflict,\" according to Redman. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European leaders from Britain, France and Germany issued a statement Saturday saying their countries had not taken part in the Iran strikes, but they added that they had been in close contact with the U.S., Israel and partners in the region. They called for a resumption of negotiations, the Associated Press reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Clearly, there are more questions than answers in this first day of this,\" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told MarketWatch. \"But there are valid concerns that this could become a larger issue than in June.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Detrick said he's bracing for near-term weakness in equities, a likely spike in crude oil and for gold and other safe-haven assets to rise. \"At the same time, the U.S. economy is still strong, and it's been a strong earnings season,\" he said, adding those factors as being a support for equity prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brent crude (BRN00) prices, the global oil benchmark, could hit $100 a barrel because of the threat of \"a spiraling security situation\" and supply disruptions out of the Middle East, according to Barclays analysts. Prices were near $73 a barrel Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Away from oil jitters, investors endured a violent rotation under the surface of the stock market in February, with investors looking for cover from artificial intelligence disruptions and cracks in credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That could spell a difficult start to March for stocks, plus the \"black cloud overhead\" from the Iran conflict, said Detrick at the Carson Group. \"To think we are going to have a calm start to March probably isn't on anyone's bingo card.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Should a longer, more complicated conflict unfold, the U.S. could tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to keep a lid on oil and gasoline prices. U.S. benchmark crude shot up to over $130 a barrel in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the U.S could look to quickly ramp up domestic production given its shale resources, and it also now exerts control over Venezuela's oil, Meli at Monachil Capital said. That may help keep crude prices in a range, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gold (GC00) jumped nearly 11% in February, finishing at $5,230.50 an ounce on Friday. That marked gold's biggest one-month percentage gain since January 2012, and its monthly gain of $516.60 was the biggest one-month net gain on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse at how investors might react as they wait for Asian markets to open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was under pressure around $65,300. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP and Dow industrials DJIA closed lower Friday, but with the S&amp;P 500 less than 2% off record levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Japanese yen (USDJPY), Swiss franc (USDCHF) and U.S. Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD30Ycould be in the outperformer category. Investors have been increasingly pushing into U.S. government debt recently, a move strategists have attributed to fears over AI threats to employment and economic growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump, addressing Iranians in a video address, said, \"Now is the time to seize control of your destiny.\"  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that congressional notification was provided before the attack, in a social-media post. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump last week offered a deadline of 10 to 15 days for a nuclear deal with Iran, which left this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike. Iran, with which the U.S. under President Barack Obama had negotiated a nuclear pact that Trump canceled during his first White House term, ranks among the world's biggest oil producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Myra P.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A massive backlog of maintenance and software contracts will ensure recurring revenue </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saturday's strikes on Iran by the U.S. and Israel will likely shine an even bigger spotlight on defense stocks. Shown: Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 4001 stealth fighter in file photo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defense stocks have been treated as a geopolitical barometer. When tensions rise and military conflict breaks out, shares climb. When headlines cool, the trade fades. It's a narrative built around procurement cycles and crisis-driven spending. The attack on Iran on Saturday by the U.S. and Israel should repeat this pattern for defense stocks in coming days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But something more structural and long-term has been unfolding, something that looks far less like a one-off weapons sale and more like a long-term service contract. Parts of the defense industry are beginning to resemble subscription businesses, recurring revenue layered on top of a growing installed base. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For investors focused on earnings durability rather than war headlines, that distinction matters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weapons systems have evolved from disposable purchases to multidecade ecosystems nowadays. Once a country fields a fleet of fighter jets, missile-defense batteries or naval destroyers, it commits to years or even decades of operating and support costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. Government Accountability Office has repeatedly noted that operating and support costs can account for roughly 70% of a major weapon system's total life-cycle cost, according to a recent GAO report. Upkeep includes spare parts, depot maintenance, training, software updates, systems integration and availability guarantees. Since national defense cannot tolerate downtime, readiness spending tends to persist even when procurement ebbs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In practical terms, the contractor that builds the platform often remains embedded in its upkeep. Every additional aircraft delivered expands the pool of long-term maintenance, logistics and modernization revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That dynamic increasingly resembles the aerospace aftermarket economy - and in some respects, enterprise software - where installed bases drive recurring cash flow. Three companies that stand to benefit: Lockheed Martin (LMT), RTX (RTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lockheed Martin: the ecosystem model. Lockheed Martin provides the clearest example of this shift. The F-35 program represented 26% of consolidated net sales in 2024, according to the company's latest Form 10-K. The filing explicitly states that F-35 revenue includes development, production and maintenance, underscoring how support and logistics are embedded in the program's economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Service sales increased in 2024, driven in part by higher volume in F-35 upkeep contracts, the company disclosed in that same annual report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the end of 2025, Lockheed Martin reported a record $194 billion backlog and strong generation of free cash flow in its full-year earnings release. That backlog provides multiyear revenue visibility that many industrial companies lack. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Support performance is not immune from scrutiny; a Pentagon watchdog has recently criticized aspects of F-35 maintenance and aircraft availability. Recurring revenue in defense is contractual and performance-based, not automatic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even so, the installed-base effect is unmistakable: Every aircraft delivered expands a long-term revenue stream tied to readiness and modernization. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     RTX: installed base, diversified. RTX offers a different version of installed-base economy. The company has recently reported strong sales growth and highlighted a backlog approaching $268 billion, according to its latest earnings results. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the defense side, missile systems and air-defense platforms require ongoing upgrades and upkeep. Collins Aerospace operates within a vast installed base of aircraft systems that generate recurring parts and maintenance demand, an approach the company emphasizes in its investor materials. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Commercial-aftermarket revenue behaves in many ways like an annuity tied to flight hours, while defense modernization cycles add a second layer of durability. The combination smooths earnings compared with pure production-driven models. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Northrop Grumman: the long arc of modernization. Northrop Grumman's portfolio is heavily weighted toward advanced systems - stealth aircraft, space assets, sensors and mission technologies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Once fielded, those systems demand continuous upgrades and integration work as modern defense doctrine emphasizes ongoing modernization rather than static platforms. Sensors are refreshed. Software evolves. Networks expand. The company ended 2025 with backlog nearing $95.7 billion, according to its most recent annual report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Northrop's strength in high-end systems integration positions it to benefit from that long modernization arc, although development-heavy programs can introduce project-timing volatility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The software layer: Defense as ongoing service </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The transformation is perhaps the most visible in defense's growing digital footprint. The U.S. Defense Department's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract vehicle reflects a shift toward acquiring commercial cloud services across classification levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Software-native companies like Palantir Technologies (PLTR) operate directly in that layer, providing analytics and AI systems through mult-year government contracts. Recent analyst coverage has highlighted the company's expanding government engagements and recurring-revenue profile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Palantir's stock nabs another upgrade, with its valuation now less of a 'struggle' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While valuation and volatility differ from traditional primes, the software layer most closely resembles a true subscription economy within defense budgets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market may be behind the curve </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite these structural shifts, defense contractors are often valued like cyclical industrial companies. The implicit assumption is that earnings are driven primarily by procurement wins and geopolitical events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Developing: The U.S. and Israel attack Iran. Bitcoin and oil offer a glimpse at how markets could react. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If maintenance, modernization and software continue rising as a share of revenue, that assumption will grow increasingly incomplete. Recurring support contracts and installed-base monetization can dampen earnings swings and support steadier free cash flow. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, intellectual property and data rights in maintenance contracts represent a critical issue that the Government Accountability Office examined in its recent review of IP and sustainment planning. Control over technical data can shape who captures margin over the life of a program. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Markets tend to reward predictability. Businesses with durable cash flows often command stronger valuation multiples than those dependent on episodic demand. If defense contractors continue migrating toward service-heavy revenue mixes, the sector's risk profile may increasingly resemble infrastructure rather than crisis trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defense stocks will continue to react to geopolitical headlines, but beneath those swings lies a structural evolution in how revenue is generated and sustained. The companies that control large, technologically complex installed bases - aircraft fleets, missile systems, naval platforms, secure networks - are not merely selling equipment. They are managing ecosystems that require continuous funding to remain operational. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This shift reframes the opportunity. Defense may no longer be just a trade on conflict. Increasingly, it resembles a long-duration cash-flow business anchored in readiness, modernization and software-driven support. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market may still be pricing yesterday's model. Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Rates have fallen overall since the start of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling mortgage rates are giving home buyers something they haven't seen in a long time: a glimpse of affordability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average 30-year mortgage rate hit 5.98% as of Feb. 26, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.01% the prior week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A year ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.76%. Elevated mortgage rates and high home prices have forced many house hunters to put off buying plans in recent years. That's driven home sales down and pushed the average age of a first-time home buyer to an all-time high of 40. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But falling mortgage rates have now pumped up buyers' purchasing power. A household making the median income of about $86,300 can now \"comfortably afford\" a $331,483 home with a 20% down payment, according to a new analysis from the real-estate platform Zillow (Z). That's $30,000 more than a year ago, Zillow said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The median sales price of an existing home in the U.S. was $396,800 as of January, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A more than $30,000 gain in buying power is meaningful for households that have been stretched thin by high rates. It can mean the difference between settling and choosing,\" noted Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow, in the report. \"That doesn't suddenly make this market affordable for everyone, but it does crack open doors that had firmly shut when rates peaked.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mortgage rates under 3% during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a rush of home buyers. But when rates soared to over 7% in late 2023 and home prices continued to tick upward, many would-be buyers were shut out of the market. That pushed home sales to 31-year low in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some see the chance for increased home sales in the coming months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For the first time in three-and-a-half years, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped into the 5% range, falling even lower than last week's milestone,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's (FMCC) chief economist. \"This rate, combined with the improving availability of homes for sale, is meaningful and will drive more potential buyers into the market for spring home-buying season.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about real estate that you would like to see covered in MarketWatch?

Profit attributable to owners of the Company stood at RM3.1 million, compared to a loss of RM3.6 million previously. The improved performance was primarily attributable to continued strong project execution and improved operational efficiency from the Group's core Construction and Support Services segment.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">On a full-year basis, Advancecon recorded revenue of RM423.1 million, representing an increase of 10.4% from RM383.2 million in FY2024. The Group reported a profit attributable to owners of RM6.7 million, compared to a loss of RM22.7 million in the previous year. This reflects a successful turnaround driven by improved operational performance, cost optimisation efforts, and more disciplined project management across its business segments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Notably, FY2025 also marked an important milestone for the Group, with Advancecon delivering four consecutive quarters of profit attributable to owners of the Company during the financial year. This reflects greater operational stability and consistency following measures undertaken to strengthen execution and improve overall efficiency. The Group's consistent quarterly profit performance reflects a structurally stronger and more sustainable earnings base.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As at <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">31 December 2025</strong> , Advancecon's outstanding order book stood at approximately <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">RM756 million</strong> , compared to <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">RM673 million as at 31 December 2024</strong> . This improvement has been supported by a series of strong contract wins secured over the past six months, with the Group securing new contracts totalling approximately RM229.5 million, reflecting continued participation in infrastructure and development projects. The order book provides ongoing work visibility for the Group's core construction activities. With a strengthened order book of approximately RM756 million and continued contract momentum, the Group is well-positioned to deliver sustained earnings growth over the next 24 months. The current order book provides strong earnings visibility through FY2027, underpinned by active participation in infrastructure and development projects.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Mdm. Phum Boon Eng, Managing Director of Advancecon Holdings Berhad</strong> , said: \"We are encouraged by the Group's return to full-year profitability and the consistency achieved over the past four quarters. This milestone marks not just a turnaround, but the beginning of Advancecon's next growth phase, as well as, the collective efforts of our team in strengthening execution, improving efficiency, and maintaining discipline in project delivery. With a strengthened order book we are confident in delivering sustainable earnings growth and long-term value for our stakeholders. We remain focused on operational stability and prudent project selection as we continue to carry out our existing works.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Advancecon's Construction and Support Services segment remained the primary contributor to revenue and profitability, supported by ongoing infrastructure and township development projects. The Group's quarry operations under Spring Energy Resources Berhad and its renewable energy segment also continued to contribute to the Group's overall operations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Advancecon's renewable energy subsidiary continues to operate its solar assets, including a 37.7MWp large-scale solar farm in Kuala Langat, Selangor, which commenced operations in November 2024, as well as rooftop solar installations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Separately, the Group's joint development with Perak Corporation Berhad for the Silver Valley Technology Park in Perak remains part of its longer-term business activities, and represents a key long-term value creation platform for the Group, with significant earnings potential as development progresses over its multi-phase rollout.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Malaysia's construction sector continues to be supported by infrastructure and development activities across both public and private sectors. The Group remains focused on its core competencies in earthworks and civil engineering while continuing to execute its existing projects. The Group is also well-positioned to benefit from increasing infrastructure investments, industrial expansion, and renewable energy development in Malaysia, which collectively support sustained construction activity across key growth corridors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Despite ongoing cost pressures arising from regulatory changes and industry competition, the Group's improving financial position, strengthening order book, and consistent operational execution provide a solid foundation for continued growth. Management remains confident that Advancecon is well-positioned to build on its turnaround momentum and deliver sustainable earnings improvement in the coming financial year.</p><span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">###</strong></p></span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">ABOUT ADVANCECON HOLDINGS BERHAD</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Founded in 1990, Advancecon is primarily involved in the provision of earthworks and civil engineering services in Malaysia, as well as related support services such as the sale of construction materials, hiring of machinery, and ad-hoc general construction services. The Group was listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia on 10 July 2017.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Advancecon's wide range of earthworks services encompass excavation and fill, rock-blasting, ground treatment works, erosion and sediment control plan, as well as compaction and surface finishing processes. On the civil engineering services front, Advancecon specializes in road works, drainage works, bridge construction, water supply works, and sewerage works.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To date, Advancecon has undertaken earthworks and civil engineering works for notable projects nationwide, including various township developments such as Bandar Setia Alam, Setia EcoHill, Setia Eco Gardens, Eco Majestic and Tropicana Aman, as well as infrastructure projects in relation to the construction of highways and railway such as West Coast Expressway (WCE), South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE), Trumpet Interchange and Ecohill Link connected to Lebuhraya Kajang Seremban (LEKAS) Highway and East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In 2019, Advancecon also established a renewable energy subsidiary, Advancecon Solar Sdn Bhd, which will undertake the development and/or operations of power generation from solar and other renewable energy projects. It currently owns revenue-generating rooftop solar assets of more than 1.2MWp and also a 37.7MWp large-scale solar farm in Kuala Langat, Selangor which commenced operation on 8 November 2024.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In 2021, Advancecon further completed the acquisition of a 51% stake in Spring Energy Resources Berhad (\"Spring Energy\"), which is an integrated quarry operation management and service provider involved in contract quarry operations, provision, marketing and management of quarry products, related advisory services, as well as the undertaking of quarry-related earthworks and civil engineering works.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In 2024, Advancecon entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Perak Corporation Berhad to develop Silver Valley Technology Park (SVTP) on an 816-acre land in Kanthan, Perak, with an estimated Gross Development Value of RM1.0 billion, which is envisioned to be a state-of-the-art industrial park.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information, please visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://pr.report/j5jp\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.advancecon.com.my/</a>.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Issued By: Swan Consultancy Sdn.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Joy Wiltermuth and Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The next 24 to 48 hours of conflict will be crucial for markets after the U.S. and Israel launched military strikes against Iran </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amoke rises in Tehran after U.S. and Israel launched a military attack. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel attacked Iran, leading Tehran to quickly retaliate with strikes within Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East after President Donald Trump called on Iranians to take over their government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those developments have raised questions about whether this conflict will last longer - and risk sweeping up more oil-producing nations - than the 10-day U.S.-Israel military operation in June targeting Tehran's nuclear facilities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This is different,\" said Ali Meli, founder and chief investment officer at Monachil Capital Partners, in a Saturday interview with MarketWatch. \"There's a belief that this may be more aimed at regime change, beyond nuclear deterrence.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     '[T]he question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical.'Ali Meli, Monachil Capital Partners </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now, the question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical,\" said Meli. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens in the next 24 to 48 hours may provide clues to the potential scope of this conflict and its likely impact on markets, with Iran's oil infrastructure and the region's Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, now a major focus. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes were nearing, as Trump suggested to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The brief June 2025 conflict is a poor guide to what is likely to follow,\" said Nick Redman, analyst at Oxford Analytica, a geopolitical risk-analysis and advisory service owned by MarketWatch publisher Dow Jones. \"Then, Iran sought to avoid confrontation because it understood U.S. objectives were limited, meaning that regional relations and wider international legitimacy were worth preserving.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, however, Iran might look to \"hunker down or seek to draw out any conflict,\" according to Redman. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European leaders from Britain, France and Germany issued a statement Saturday saying their countries had not taken part in the Iran strikes, but they added that they had been in close contact with the U.S., Israel and partners in the region. They called for a resumption of negotiations, the Associated Press reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Clearly, there are more questions than answers in this first day of this,\" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told MarketWatch. \"But there are valid concerns that this could become a larger issue than in June.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Detrick said he's bracing for near-term weakness in equities, a likely spike in crude oil and for gold and other safe-haven assets to rise. \"At the same time, the U.S. economy is still strong, and it's been a strong earnings season,\" he said, adding those factors as being a support for equity prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, investors have endured a violent rotation under the surface of the stock market in February, with investors looking for cover from artificial intelligence disruptions and cracks in credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That could spell a difficult start to March for stocks, plus the \"black cloud overhead\" from the Iran conflict, Detrick said. \"To think we are going to have a calm start to March probably isn't on anyone's bingo card.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Should a longer, more complicated conflict unfold, the U.S. could tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to keep a lid on oil and gasoline prices. U.S. benchmark crude shot up to over $130 a barrel in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the U.S could quickly ramp up domestic production given its shale resources, and it also now exerts control over Venezuela's oil, Meli at Monachil Capital said.
