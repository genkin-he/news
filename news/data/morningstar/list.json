The Chinese government had blocked some shipments from Nexperia, threatening to upend the auto industry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration and the Chinese government have reached an agreement to resume chip shipments from semiconductor company Nexperia, the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The resumption is part of a trade agreement reached this week between the U.S. and China, the Journal reported. Details of the deal were expected to be included in a fact sheet that the White House would release later on Friday, the report said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Automakers are bracing for a chip crisis that could roil production </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Netherlands took control of Nexperia, a key automotive-microchip maker owned by China's Wingtech Technology (CN:600745), in September. In response, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce blocked exports of some Nexperia products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company is responsible for around 5% of the global automotive silicon-discrete market, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility, and the shortage threatened to upend the automobile industry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nexperia mostly sells standard parts that are widely used but not technologically advanced, with hundreds of chips often needed per vehicle. Some automakers had slowed down production, and many had expressed concerns about their production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The industry went through a prolonged and more dire chip shortage during the pandemic, which became emblematic of global supply-chain disruptions. At the time, U.S. automakers would partially build their vehicles and wait for chips to be installed later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. At the time Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547069-1&amp;h=2013038123&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm</a>, on Twitter: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547069-1&amp;h=1301859455&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://twitter.com/rosen_firm</a> or on Facebook: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4547069-1&amp;h=3181757778&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Attorney Advertising.

The Company believes that a cross-listing could enhance shareholder value by expanding access to a wider base of potential institutional and retail investors. Additionally, the greater exposure to U.S. capital markets generally would be expected to strengthen engagement with the North American research and development community, supporting Onco's long-term growth trajectory.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">The groundwork we have laid over the past several months has positioned us to move decisively into clinical development.

(2) that, as a result, “certain road map and resource decisions” were unlikely to “yield their intended results;” (3) that the foregoing had a material negative impact on financial results; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Synopsys securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">60 days from the date of this notice</strong> to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Contact Us To Participate or Learn More:</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact us:\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nCharles Linehan, Esq.,\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Glancy Prongay &amp;
