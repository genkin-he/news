            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'All correspondence regarding the account was sent to my wife's email' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Shouldn't the credit-card company have sent nonpayment notices to me?\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I received a credit warning about a three-month overdue payment on a credit card held by my wife, with me listed as an authorized user. All correspondence regarding the account was sent to my wife's email, so the credit warning was the first time I became aware of her nonpayment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The amount owed (including interest) was under $55, so that part is not the issue. My question concerns the credit-card company. Shouldn't it have sent nonpayment notices to me, as an authorized user, and at least given me an opportunity to pay the bill before notifying me through a negative credit report? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Husband </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm rich in everything but parents': I inherited $400K. Is it unwise to use this money to buy a house with my fiancé? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conversation, if you want to have one, should be with your wife, not the credit-card company or the credit bureau. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Husband, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The call about the credit score should be coming from inside the house. There is a difference between a co-owner of a credit card, who is responsible for the debt, even after the other co-owner dies, and an authorized signer, who has the right to make purchases on the account in order to build up their credit but cannot make payments and has no legal liability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conversation, if you want to have one, should be with your wife, not the credit-card company or the credit bureau. It doesn't matter to the credit bureau whether it's $55 or $555. What matters is how long the debt has remained unpaid. Once a payment reaches 30 days past due, it is reported to the credit bureaus, and the damage compounds at 60 days and in particular at 90 days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Indeed, payment history is the most important factor in credit scoring, according to TransUnion (TRU), Equifax (EFX) and Experian (EXPGY). Being 90 days late on a credit-card payment can cause a severe drop in your score, and it can remain on your credit report for up to seven years if the debt remains unpaid, although the impact on your score lessens over time. If the debt is not paid, the lender would likely close your account or sell the debt to a collection agency. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If your credit score benefits from being an authorized user on your wife's card, the opposite is also true: If payments are late, your credit score will take a hit. It may be your wife's credit card, credit report and responsibility, but both your credit scores are on the line. \"That means both users should practice good credit habits,\" says Discover. \"Late and missed credit-card payments may stay on your credit report for years and seriously damage your credit score.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A teachable moment </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"So, it's important to make sure the primary cardmember typically manages payments responsibly,\" the credit-card company adds. \"You should also be sure to uphold any agreements you've made about paying a portion of the bill. You should also avoid overspending. Racking up expensive charge after expensive charge may do more than just frustrate the person who has to foot the credit-card bill.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your wife's (and your) unpaid credit-card debt is a small one. In the third quarter of 2025, the typical American carried an average credit-card balance of $6,500, and credit-card debt in the U.S. has climbed to a record total of $1.23 trillion. With interest rates for credit cards at 20% and higher, that adds up to a lot of money if you don't pay off your debt every month. Generation X, for what it's worth, carries the largest monthly debt - more than $9,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, this is a teachable moment - a warning for both of you to keep on top of your credit-card statements. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling and American Consumer Credit Counseling can help  those who are sliding into the red climb out of debt. And 12-step support groups, including Debtors Anonymous, provide a safe space to talk about your background and your emotional life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you and your wife don't have a monthly budget of your income and expenditures, including utilities, property taxes, home insurance, mortgage payments, groceries and gas, this is a good time to put one together. If saving $100 or $200 a month by not eating out helps you pay off one of your credit cards, then plan an extra-special evening cooking at home instead. Not everyone does things perfectly, but make sure this unpaid debt isn't part of a larger problem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'She is planning to move out of state': My sister sold our elderly mother's house from under her.

The money is not currently in a bank account and it is not part of an estate - let's assume it's just cash in an envelope - and I live in a state with no inheritance tax. I assume I can make this deposit legally and that there will be no tax consequences. Am I correct? Must I provide a recent death certificate? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lone Ranger </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 2025 has been one hell of a year.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how this money was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope - and I'm not sure I want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In any case, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect potential money laundering. It does not mean that you have done anything wrong, so as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong, it should not create a problem for you. But there should be a paper trail in case you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What if you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? Deliberately breaking up financial transactions to avoid triggering reports that are required by law is called \"structuring,\" and it's illegal. The authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a magnifying glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and was not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of a death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's death. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax versus estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the bank teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent, the bank might request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Within a week or two after the deadline to contest the will expired, my stepmother sent me an email stating she would not share anything' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"My siblings kept it a secret that our shares were all being given to my dad's new wife of two months.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If someone promises to share the wealth from a will and doesn't, you may have legal options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Maybe this will help someone else. I found out too late, but it appears you may have options if you are left with nothing in a new will and the new spouse says she will share the wealth - then, after the period to contest the will passes, says you get nothing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's called \"promissory estoppel\" and there is typically a three-year statutory limit to bring it to court. Also, look up constructive trust and attorney's fees (sometimes possible under equitable relief if bad faith is shown). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In my situation, my siblings kept it a secret that our shares were all being given to my dad's new wife of two months. The wedding was rushed, with only one sister in attendance. The will was changed months later, and after that, my dad died. That's when I found out about the new will. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A week later, the new wife told everyone she would share the wealth, including me personally. Contesting the will was going to be difficult because my wealthier siblings were okay with it. My dad had also suffered a heart attack within a week of signing the new will. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I wouldn't have ended up with much after legal fees, so I decided to see if she would share, as my siblings suggested. Within a week or two after the deadline to contest the will expired, my stepmother sent me an email stating she would not share anything. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether my siblings knew that would happen is unknown. That email is what starts the clock on estoppel. I thought it was over at that point, but that's actually when I had a much stronger case. This sudden marriage and subsequent will-change cost me about $500,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I also later learned that if parents have two similar wills and one of them dies, courts can consider it a joint will. That means the remaining parent cannot drastically change the will as happened in my case. I suggest saving copies of all wills for future reference. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's your take? Is it too late? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Stepson </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'People are often unreasonable when money is involved': My husband, 62, gave me a 5-year life estate. Would I have to pay for a new roof? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It ultimately depends on whether the promise was sound and/or whether you made decisions based on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Stepson, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yes, promissory estoppel is a legal doctrine in some states. But it may not be too late. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The deadline to contest a will can be a matter of months in many jurisdictions, but the statute for promissory estoppel varies from two years to six years, depending on where you live. The reason is not because you're contesting the will, but are effectively bringing a case against your stepmother's alleged breach of promise. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not sure your father's heart attack, which happened after he signed the new will, would play a part. Your stepmother could argue that they married specifically so she would inherit the estate. (An attorney could better advise you on the merits of your case, whether it applies in your state and/or if there is evidence that such a promise was not fulfilled.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That aside, you may have a good case. If your stepmother did indeed talk you out of suing by promising you a share of the estate, and you miss the deadline because you trusted her, the law may treat your lost lawsuit as the \"price\" you paid for that promise - or \"forbearance to sue\" - and may force your stepmother to honor her promise. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The facts, as you describe them, may not be regarded by the law as a casual promise. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The facts, as you describe them, may not be regarded by the law as a casual promise. Your stepmother appears to have persuaded you not to exercise your legal right - in this case, contesting probate - and then refusing payment. The court could see this as equitable fraud or unjust enrichment, usually easier to prove than promissory estoppel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If someone makes a promise that they should reasonably expect you to rely on - and it's reasonable for a normal person to rely upon that promise - and you get hurt because of that so-called \"reliance,\" a court may enforce the promise to prevent unfairness. So it ultimately depends on whether the promise was sound and/or whether you made decisions based on it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A party plaintiff's misguided belief or guileless action in relying on a statement on which no reasonable person would rely is not justifiable reliance,\" according to Vondran Legal, which has offices in California and Arizona. \"If the conduct of the plaintiff in light of his own intelligence and information was manifestly unreasonable, he will be denied a recovery.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burden of proof </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As always, the burden of proof would be on you to make your case that your stepmother made an unambiguous promise. In legal terms, that could include a text, email or letter that says, \"I will give you $500,000 or one-third of the estate. (Other situations may include statements like, \"I'll cover your $5,000 moving expenses,\" or \"You have the job. You start in a month!\") </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If your stepmother acknowledged in the email she sent you after the statute of limitations expired on contesting the will, even implicitly, that she promised to give you $500,000, that could suffice. If would, possibly, prove admission of a prior promise and proof of reliance damages. Your lost chance to contest the will likely start the clock on the statute of limitations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Generally, you also have to show that you took actions or, in fact, chose not to do something, based on this promise that was detrimental to you financially. This evidence might include financial statements - perhaps you made a purchase based on the expectation that you were receiving $500,000 - or maybe held off on taking a lucrative job. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your lost chance to contest the will may start the clock on the statute of limitations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Identical wills are not joint wills. Joint wills are complicated and, unlike trusts that become irrevocable upon one spouse's death, are not necessarily unchangeable after one spouse dies. Mary G. LaGrone, a Nashville, Tenn.-based attorney, expresses caution about joint wills, one document signed by both spouses. \"Some probate courts won't even honor them,\" she says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A potentially serious drawback to a joint will is that once one of the spouses dies, the other can't make changes to it, no matter how necessary,\" she adds. \"If an adult child, for example, demonstrates that they're no longer able to handle their future inheritance - perhaps because they've developed a drug or gambling problem - there's nothing you can do about it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not clear that your father and stepmother's wills were mutual wills. \"These are two identical wills created by each spouse,\" LaGrone adds. \"They include an addendum - codicil - stipulating that neither can be changed unless both spouses agree. Just as with a joint will, this means that the surviving spouse can't change the terms of their will after their spouse dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a lot on your side. Just remember, an oral promise may not be enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: After bitcoin's fall, pity those wildly enthusiastic investors who borrowed billions against crypto </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Check out the Moneyist private Facebook group, where members help answer life's thorniest money issues.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your unwillingness to take out a loan may end up costing you more in the long run, given that you would have to pay income tax on withdrawals from your IRA, plus lost returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Nearing, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have an $18,000 problem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another issue: Your unwillingness to take out a loan may end up costing you more in the long run, given that you would have to pay income tax on withdrawals from your IRA, plus the amount of money you will lose in lost returns on those funds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here is the true lifetime cost of withdrawing $18,000 from your traditional IRA. First, you'd end up paying $3,000 to $5,500 in income tax, depending on your tax bracket, so you'd actually have to take out closer to $24,000 from your traditional IRA. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adding in the opportunity cost - over the next 20 years, the likely period of time when you will be making withdrawals from your retirement accounts - you would lose $47,800 in just unrealized returns at a conservative annual 5% rate of return. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So your unwillingness to take out any debt to pay for these repairs would actually cost you closer to $53,000. That's why you will hear CPAs and economists talk about \"good debt\" (HELOCs, in certain circumstances, and mortgages) and \"bad debt\" (credit cards). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An $18,000 home-equity line of credit (HELOC) would cost you approximately $212 a month with a 7.3% interest rate over 10 years (and cost $25,400 in total). Because HELOCs usually have variable rates, it would be better to pay it off faster than 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I believe you should take out a loan. You need to balance your future returns, how much money you have set aside for emergencies and taxes. If you do insist on tapping your retirement, use the cash, then move onto your Roth and, only as a last resort, dip into your traditional IRA. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Planning for retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taking a step back, in your 60s, you should be focusing on maximizing your savings, minimizing your tax burden in retirement, planning when to take your Social Security benefits and adjusting your risk profile so you're not vulnerable to stock-market shocks, especially in those early years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Charles Schwab (SCHW), if you're in a lower income-tax bracket (0%, 10% or 12% rate), \"consider maxing out your Roth savings, where you pay the taxes up front, because your tax bracket in retirement is likely to be the same or higher than it is today.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're in a middle tax bracket (22% or 24% rate) \"consider splitting your retirement savings between tax-deferred and Roth accounts so you can benefit from both tax treatments. You might also want to consider additional savings in an HSA,\" it adds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And if you're in a higher tax bracket (32%, 35% or 37% rate) your tax rate in retirement is likely to be the same or even lower than today, so maximize your tax-deferred accounts - in this case, your IRA. Every $1 contributed to a traditional account avoids taxes at 32%-37% today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other challenges you'll face - beyond your house repairs - will be your own repairs. That is, your medical bills. Without long-term-care insurance, you will at least have the value of your home to tap in the event you need to move to assisted living. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your retirement income </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's obviously not a lot to live on, but it doesn't include Social Security. When you decide to claim depends on when you need the income, but it also hinges on how long you expect to live. Are you a smoker? Are you in good health? How old did your parents live to be? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can also keep working and collect Social Security once you reach your full retirement age. \"Starting with the month you reach full retirement age, there is no limit on how much you can earn and still receive your benefits,\" the Social Security Administration says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your Social Security benefit is based on your 35 highest-earning years. For 2026, the maximum a person can earn in the year is $184,500. Social Security taxes will not be withheld above this limit. The maximum possible monthly Social Security benefit for 2025 is $5,251. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is the time to stress-test your retirement, based on your estimated expenses. The 4% rule assumes 30 years of withdrawals. That's based on historical market returns. So if you retire at 67: Your $531,500 could potentially last you 30 years, if you took $21,000 a year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are several programs that provide funds, grants and low-interest loans for house repairs for seniors. Check out the USDA Section 504 loans/grants, Weatherization Assistance Program, HUD Title 1 loans and non-profits like Rebuilding Together. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Think carefully before tapping your retirement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'She is planning to move out of state': My sister sold our elderly mother's house from under her.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'My son is smart - he really is - but he was in love' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"My son is smart - he really is - but he was in love.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A caution to anyone who doesn't already know this. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My son is smart - he really is - but he was in love. He and his live-in girlfriend mingled their finances. I'm not sure how much, but now that they've parted, his credit rating is wrecked. Just enough that he couldn't apply for a car loan or an apartment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yes, he has managed to get both because he has a good, long-term job, and he's slowly crawling out of the abyss. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I have no idea about her, and I don't care. She was a shopper and spent $1,000 a month on weight-loss drugs. Oh, she looks great! He was guilty of following her across the country and back, and apparently letting her buy whatever she wanted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lesson learned - big time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My husband and I never mingled money. I have mine, he has his, and we have one account for bills. Maybe one of the few good decisions I made in our marriage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I probably told all my kids this at one time, but really it's none of my business. They're adults and very well employed. The others have not fallen into this trap. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some story, right? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Mother </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm rich in everything but parents': I inherited $400K. Is it unwise to use this money to buy a house with my fiancé? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son, I'm sorry to say, bears the responsibility for his own credit rating, even if his girlfriend was a reckless spender. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Mother, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son learnt a lesson the hard way. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The biggest lesson is about boundaries, personal and financial. It is, in fact, extremely difficult to ruin your credit rating because you lived with a person, unless your joint responsibilities - utilities, etc. - were not paid on time and/or your son allowed his girlfriend to use his credit cards to shop, or he himself got into the red paying for their joint lifestyle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son, I'm sorry to say, bears the responsibility for his own credit rating and, even if his girlfriend was a reckless spender and made demands on your son, he is the one who needs to do some soul-searching. Because if it happened once, and the finger of blame is being pointed at his girlfriend - perhaps an easy reaction - it could happen again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nor do I believe we should blame your son's girlfriend for using weight-loss drugs, which can be life-saving by helping to prevent diseases like diabetes. These medications, particularly GLP-1 brands like Wegovy (DK:NOVO.B) and Zepbound (LLY), can cost $1,000 a month or more without insurance coverage. The costs are obviously significantly less if someone has insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Unmarried couples are not legally bound to each other - marriage is a business contract as much as it is a legal and romantic one - so it would have taken a few naive or, frankly, head-scratching decisions by your son to mingle his finances with this lady. Did he leave credit cards lying around? Did he pay for her? Did they open a joint account for bills? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Without more detail, we can only speculate how your son's credit rating was ruined. But I am willing to bet that he made some unwise decisions about his own finances in the process. It's easy to look back on a broken relationship and blame one party, but as with most relationships - marriages or cohabitants - the responsibility is usually 50/50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cohabiting unmarried couples </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Like your son, more unmarried couples will face decisions about how and when to mingle their finances. Fewer than half (47%) of households last year were married couples - a big shift from 50 years earlier, when nearly two-thirds (66%) were married, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's historical America's Families and Living Arrangements. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Couples find it helpful to have one joint account in which each person contributes a set amount each month that is used solely for paying shared expenses,\" says wealth-management firm Focus Partners. \"Outline specifically all the shared expenses and those that you will be responsible for individually. How much you contribute to the joint account is up to you.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It is much easier to figure out the details in times of happiness and bliss than at the end of a relationship when you might be acting from a place of anger or hurt,\" the firm adds. \"It may be a good idea to draft a domestic partnership agreement with an attorney that spells out the legal and financial responsibilities of each partner and how you would split anything jointly owned.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I receive many letters from readers who wonder about the wisdom of commingling their finances. This woman, for instance, did not mingle her finances with her first husband, but is buying a home with her second husband and told me that she intends on rolling $150,000 - the proceeds from the sale of her home - into her new purchase. That would be a mistake. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your son, I believe, has a lot of questions to ask himself. HIs ex-girlfriend is just a proxy for all of the judgments he will make in life. It will never be a straight line. Landlords will hike rents, employers will cut staff, customers won't pay their debts, and your choice of partner may not have the same ideological or financial outlook. It's up to all of us to stay true to ourselves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I'm part of a blended family that didn't blend well': My stepsister added her mailing address to our mother's bank account.

Yesterday, I had to spend almost $400 on a repair, and I estimate that similar expenses will occur two to three times per year. I'm trying to determine at what point it makes sense to replace the unit. I don't yet know what a new unit will cost, but I plan to find out on Monday when the salesperson visits. Is there a formula or method for figuring out when replacement becomes more cost-effective than ongoing repairs? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Homeowner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million.

He has not proven that he can do that, so it's time for a second opinion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Homeowner, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Regular maintenance should, as any dentist will tell you, help prevent pain later on. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since your HVAC unit is 11 years old and you're spending $400 per repair two to three times a year, it's costing you $1,000 a year. So it would take 15 years to reach the $15,000 price tag of a new unit. As older units tend to fail more often, repair costs are likely to rise each year, and a major breakdown could hit you with even bigger sticker shock. If your system is more than 10 years old and annual repairs exceed $500 to $1,000 a year, start putting money aside for a replacement. From what you say, replacing the unit would be more cost-effective and less stressful. However, I'm not convinced that your maintenance man is not missing the problem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A leak of the chemical refrigerant, which is crucial for the cooling and heating process, can reduce cooling efficiency, cause the buildup of ice on coils, increase your energy costs and lead to periodic breakdowns in the entire system. Your maintenance man keeps coming back and, it seems, fixing the same problem. If there is a leak, he needs to find it. He has not proven that he can do that, so it's time for a second opinion. You should conduct maintenance on your HVAC every year, but three times a year is not sustainable. So you either find the problem and fix it or invest in a new air-conditioning unit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The silver lining, I hope, is that you can afford your heating and cooling bills. \"I dread the snow,\" a friend recently told me, because the cold temperatures mean they'll have to turn up the heat for weeks, meaning a surge in their heating bill. It can make a difference for a house with two or more bedrooms. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association recently reported that home heating costs are expected to rise 11% this winter (November through March), driven by higher energy prices. That's nearly four times the rate of inflation. (Homes that rely on electricity for their heating are predicted to rise more than those relying on natural gas.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lifespan of units </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Back to your HVAC: While some brands have better reputations than others, Constellation (CEG), the energy company, has this guide on the lifespan of units. Taking these estimates at face value, your unit should have at least another four years left, so let's assume that with a change of maintenance contractor, you will find the leak and solve the problem. Here are some lifespan estimates, according to Constellation: central air-conditioning units (12 to 17 years); heat pumps (10 to 16 years); furnaces and boilers (15 to 20 years); geothermal heat pumps (25 to 30 years); ground loops (50 years); solar panels (25 to 30 years); and evaporative coolers (5 to 15 years). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HVACs, like people, require regular tuneups. So if your unit costs you $15,000, you want to make sure it lasts as long as possible. The healthier the unit, the fewer times you will have to replace it. Those seasonal tuneups start with simple tasks like changing filters, inspecting refrigerant levels and keeping outdoor components clean, according to the experts at Constellation. Cleaning air filters removes dust, pet hair and germs, and - the best part - replacing them is inexpensive and easy. The same is true for keeping air ducts clean. To save money, put the system on \"auto\" (rather than \"all day\") and turn it off if you're going away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It is important to understand, however, that there really is no such thing as an average HVAC system,\" the company adds. \"The features and functions of different units vary tremendously. A system that only produces heat and doesn't include air conditioning will perform differently from a heat pump, for example, that does both. Usage patterns will affect how long a system might last. Heavy use will increase wear and tear and decrease a unit's lifespan. How well they are maintained can also make a difference that is measured in decades of more useful life. It is often worth paying more up front for a higher-quality unit.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Good luck with the new maintenance man in solving your temperature trouble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Can I stop my kids from using their inheritance to support political causes I vehemently oppose? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My wife's credit-card payment is three months overdue.

Physically, he is not able to live independently, but was or is pretty sharp mentally. We take care of all his bills; his house and car were sold over three years ago. His wife died in 2020; they had no children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 10 days, he started calling my sister about bills he needed to pay; all his bills are being paid by her. He also wants to know the balance in his bank accounts. My sister has always given him this information when he asks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He wanted to see the lawyer recently. He was very paranoid, asking staff to witness their conversation. He doesn't remember that he sold his house or car. In an email, his lawyer said, \"He's gone off the deep end.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lawyer's last words to us were we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate. My sister and I are his only family, the will is made and we would inherit his estate. What do we do next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Other Sibling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Sibling, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not encouraged by the tone or content of his attorney's email. It lacks compassion, professionalism and respect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother is confused and needs help. But he doesn't need an executor. An executor is appointed by the probate court after your brother passes away (and would typically be designated executor in his will). A power of attorney usually looks after a person's finances while they have diminished capacity; a durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. A conservator/guardian would be appointed by the courts to oversee his financial, physical and medical wellbeing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Take immediate steps to safeguard your brother's safety: He may need an assessment for dementia or cognitive impairment from a neurologist or geriatrician. I hope that the assisted-living facility is aware of this change of behavior, and is equipped to help him navigate this next stage. You will all need to work together until you figure out the next steps for your brother. Questions remain: What kind of power of attorney document currently exists? What legal capacity does your brother have to make decisions for himself - everything from hiring a new lawyer to revoking a POA? Has your brother been actually diagnosed with dementia? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, you will require health advocates and a competent lawyer. If the lawyer mentioned in your letter is not equipped to deal with your brother's situation - and it could be so given his reaction to the decline in your brother's health - you need a new lawyer to oversee your brother's affairs; as his joint powers of attorney, you can help him to appoint one. They will be able to help outline your options, which will depend on what kind of POA you hold and whether or not your brother requires conservatorship/guardianship, which should be a last resort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Laws regarding a conservator/guardian vary by state. In Texas, you would need to file a petition with the court. \"A hearing will be held, and the judge will examine the evidence and make a decision,\" says Childs Legacy Law Firm in Houston. \"In the second instance, absent a pending petition, and in lieu of a family member, living will or another relevant document, the court will appoint a conservator. The conservator can be any number of people, like a friend, social worker, neighbor, church member, attorney, nurse [or] another qualified person.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     General conservatorship </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A general conservatorship is created when an adult - typically an elderly person but can be a younger adult person - cannot manage their finances or health due to deteriorated mental capacity or impairment caused by an illness or injury,\" it adds. \"While they recover from the illness or injury, a conservator may be appointed by a court to address their medical and financial needs.\" Reasons include a person falling into a coma, a form of dementia like Alzheimer's, head injury or a stroke that impairs their ability to think or express their wishes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating, quite suddenly. \"People who suffer from any of the above can become vulnerable to bad actors who may try to manipulate the situation for their own financial gain. These bad actors may, for example, attempt to divert your disability payments (fraud) or coerce you into changing a will (undue influence),\" the law firm says. It is always better to draft an estate plan while you have the legal capacity to write and sign such a document. Otherwise, it will be left up to the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating. He needs calm and legal protection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, your brother needs reassurance and validation, clear and comforting communication, a routine so he feels safe, and legal protection; document everything, especially his changes in behavior. If he does not already have a healthcare proxy or healthcare power of attorney, and your brother is not of sound mind, the courts will appoint one for him. If he is in assisted living, for example, there may come a time when you will have to move him to a full-time care facility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the absence of long-term-care insurance or Medicaid, I assume you will use (or have used) the proceeds from the sale of his house to pay for his care. Selling a primary residence turns the home's equity from an exempt asset into countable cash, which often exceeds the strict monthly $2,000-$3,000 individual limit for Medicaid, which would lead to a temporary loss of benefits until those funds are spent. A trust and estate attorney can talk through your options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can do this. But you can't - nor should you - do it alone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am fearful': My ailing relative is being forced into assisted living.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Dubai International Airport in February 2021. Dubai and other airports in the region fashioned themselves into major international hubs over the years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Middle Eastern airports such as United Arab Emirates' Dubai and Qatar's Doha fashioned themselves into the crossroads of the world in the last couple of decades. Both are closed following U.S. and Israel's attacks on Iran on Saturday, wreaking havoc in international air travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dubai and Doha are among the largest international hubs for air travel, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Flights from these hubs go to all continents,\" he said. \"It's going to be highly highly disruptive to international air travelers.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel's strikes on Saturday led to Tehran's strikes of its own, with President Donald Trump calling on Iranians to overthrow their government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Aviation analytics firm Cirium said Saturday the three major airlines operating out of the UAE and Qatar - Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad - connect about 90,000 transiting passengers a day, not including passengers destined for the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several airlines canceled flights to Middle Eastern airports due to safety concerns, including United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) scratching their flights to Tel Aviv at least through the weekend, among other changes and cancellations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stephen Trent, an independent airline analyst who spent decades at major investment banks, noted that U.S. airlines already spent the last couple of years experiencing disruption in the region and already restricted their routes, which could minimize the current direct disruption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dubai's and Doha's airports were catapulted into major air-travel hubs starting in the 2000s as their own countries became global economic powerhouses. Dubai's Emirates, for instance, is one of only a select group of airlines flying Airbus' A380 jets, the largest commercial plane ever built, with room for more than 500 passengers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Historically, Iran's Mehrabad airport in Tehran was emerging as a global hub connecting East and West in the 1970s, but that trajectory cut short by the Iranian Revolution, Harteveldt said. Over the years, Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi's airports took that mantle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depending on how long the conflict and airport closures last, cargo would also be affected, Harteveldt said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even with an end to the conflict, it will take time for airlines to right their schedules and resume normal operations, since their planes - and crews - were diverted to other airports and are scattered due to the closures, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
