And so far this year, Hershey said its chocolate retail sales have returned to growth, they have increased 4% after a previous 1% decline in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the stock dropped 3.8% in morning trading, toward the lowest prices seen since mid-July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     During the third quarter, Reese's Oreo was the \"top new item\" in the candy, mint and gum category, the company said, with retail-sales trends exceeding targets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Reese's Oreo </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Early data shows that Reese's Oreo overindexes with Gen Z and millennial buyers, a priority audience for the brand,\" Tanner said. The company is preparing fresh advertising and partnerships to raise the confectionery's profile on Instagram, TikTok and through live events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Overall, net sales for the third quarter increased 6.5% from a year ago to $3.18 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus revenue estimate of $3.12 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Hershey has managed to boost prices, and as tariff costs have declined, the extra revenue \"only partially mitigates\" inflation from higher cocoa costs, which are still about 70% above levels in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hershey said it expects cocoa prices to come down over time, with a larger global supply surplus expected for the 2025 and 2026 crop thanthe prior season. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Third-quarter net income fell to $276.3 million from $446.3 million in the year-ago quarter, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 handily beat the FactSet consensus EPS estimate of $1.07. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company raised its outlook for 2025 EPS to between $5.90 and $6 from a range of $5.81 to $6. That compares with the analyst EPS projection of $6.02 a share, and with the year-ago level of $9.37 a share. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff in Hershey's stock has turned it negative for the year.

The work builds on models trained using the company's in-house neuroactive compound screening data, as well as public sources, and applies predictive modeling to identify chemical signatures associated with AChE inhibition.
