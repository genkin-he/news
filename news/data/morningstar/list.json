With 42% margins, you'd expect a richer valuation, but Waystar trades at about seven-times sales - a far cry from bubble territory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Next, look at the enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) leaders where AI genuinely enhances products, rather than cannibalizing core businesses: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Atlassian (TEAM): Atlassian's growth remains solid - fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.38 billion - and the company is leaning into AI as a core pillar. Its centerpiece is Atlassian Rovo, an AI \"teammate\" introduced in May 2024 that layers search, chat and AI agents across Jira, Confluence and other tools to help teams find information, summarize work and automate workflows. With a base of more than 300,000 customers, deeply embedded products (Jira, Confluence) and a potent AI layer, Atlassian is one of the purer enterprise SaaS AI plays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DocuSign (DOCU): Shares of DocuSign tumbled at the end of September after headlines framed OpenAI's new \"DocuGPT\" as a competitive threat. In reality, DocuGPT was presented as an internal OpenAI agent that converts contracts into structured, searchable data - not an e-signature platform or commercial DocuSign replacement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff overlooked DocuSign's real strength: its entrenched legal-compliance infrastructure, enterprise integrations and a growing Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform that uses AI to analyze and manage contracts end to end. These capabilities are deeply embedded across regulated industries and supported by the company's roughly $900 million in annual free cash flow, allowing continued investment and share repurchases. With AI enhancing - not replacing - its core workflow moat, DocuSign remains one of the most undervalued enterprise automation plays amid AI-driven market confusion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adobe (ADBE): Adobe reported $6 billion in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up roughly 11% year over year, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.31. The company also noted that its AI-influenced annual recurring revenue surpassed $5 billion, and its generative-AI-model family (Adobe Firefly) has already produced more than 24 billion pieces of content. Despite this, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 - well below its historical 10-year average of 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The thesis is brutally simple: These companies boast loyal users, documented time- and cost-savings tools, and deep integration that customers keep paying for regardless of headline volatility. They aren't betting on the farm on AI; they're using it to widen existing competitive moats and improve unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your bubble-management playbook </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The timeline for maximum disruption in AI runs from the beginning of 2026 until the third quarter of 2027. This is the point when both the AI pilot launches that haven't produced a return on investment and the 2021-2023 AI startups run out of capital. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports that 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024, with the average organization scrapping 46% of AI proof of concepts before production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates the framework for a slow-motion AI-bubble deflation, rather than a catastrophic burst: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 1 hyperscalers with diversified revenue will weather disappointing AI returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 2 unicorns face valuation compression or acquisition. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 3 experiences mass casualties, with a small cohort of survivors demonstrating actual unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three plays outlined above position investors for this selective deflation: buying Tier 1 quality on 15% to 20% corrections; positioning in data-center infrastructure ahead of verified 2027 constraints; and accumulating profitable companies - whether routine automation or mispriced SaaS - being unfairly sold off alongside failing startups. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI bubble is deflating on schedule - but the infrastructure buildout and automation revolution remain genuine opportunities for investors who can distinguish between speculative AI startups burning cash and profitable enterprises solving real problems with measurable returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: These stocks are the real deal for investors in AI - Wall Street is just chasing bubbles </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Everyone's asking the wrong question about an AI bubble. Here are the stocks to buy - and when. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I've been watching the AI bubble inflate for months now - the unsustainable burn rates, the pilot projects that went nowhere, the startups that couldn't explain their unit economics. So when industry insiders finally started ringing alarm bells, I couldn't resist diving deeper into what's really happening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What I found surprised me. Yes, there's an AI bubble. But the viral claim that it's 17-times larger than the dot-com crash is misleading. MacroStrategy Partnership's headline-grabbing analysis measured total capital misallocation across all asset classes, not AI specifically. It seems to me that the math behind the analysis was designed to terrify, not inform. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More importantly, everyone's asking the wrong question. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The debate shouldn't be whether the AI bubble will pop - that's already happening. Not in some dramatic, market-crushing way that will dominate headlines, but through a slow-motion deflation that's quietly reshaping the entire landscape. The casualties are already piling up: startup shutdowns surged in 2024; in 2025, 95% of enterprise AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact within six months of launch; and down rounds this year hit a decade high at 15.9% of all venture deals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many companies that scream the loudest about the bubble are either exaggerating the threat or fundamentally misunderstanding what's actually unfolding. This isn't the 2000 dot-com collapse all over again. It's far more interesting and far more profitable if you know where to look. I've identified three distinct market tiers facing radically different fates: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 1: The hyperscalers (Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)) are essentially unassailable. Their estimated $320 billion to $340 billion in 2025 capex spending - largely for AI and cloud infrastructure - comes from operating cash flow generated by their core businesses. They can weather extended periods of disappointing AI returns because their core businesses print money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 2: The unicorns in limbo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI) command massive valuations but face existential questions. Can they achieve returns that justify stratospheric valuations? Can they compete against both hyperscalers with infinite resources and substantially cheaper models coming in from overseas? The next 18 to 24 months will separate the winners and losers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 3: Mass casualties are showing up in the numbers. We're seeing more shutdowns (up 26% year over year in 2024), decade-high down rounds in 2025, thinner deal counts and smaller checks, plus enterprises scrapping a big chunk of AI work and failing to get a return on investment (ROI) from pilots. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Expectations are being managed to engineer an orderly deflation rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Sam Altman openly admits that investors as a whole are overexcited about AI at the same time his OpenAI reaches a valuation of $500 billion, he's not confessing failure - he's managing expectations to engineer an orderly deflation, rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates a rare market asymmetry: The public sees \"bubble\" and flees everything AI-related, while sophisticated capital is making precise bets on deflation survivors. Here are three investment strategies to put you on the winning side of any correction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     1. Buy Tier 1 hyperscalers after the 15% to 20% correction </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When the next correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft: Microsoft's AI business is already at a $13 billion annual run rate, up 175% year over year, but most of its money still comes from core products including Azure, Office and Windows. With about $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Microsoft can easily fund its AI buildout without stretching its balance sheet. A pullback in the stock to $400 to $420 would bring the valuation back to around 30-times earnings - right at historical norms and a strong long-term entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon.com: Amazon's cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing about 17.5% year over year, hitting a $123 billion annual run rate. The bulk of Amazon's revenue still comes from retail and e-commerce, giving the company the cash flow and scale to invest heavily in AI infrastructure without jeopardizing its core business. If the shares pulled back 15%, the valuation would drop into the 27- to 30-times-earnings range, offering a potentially compelling entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet: Internet-search advertising still accounts for roughly 56% of revenue, and for the second quarter of 2025, the company posted an operating margin of 32.4%. Estimated capital expenditures for 2025 are roughly $85?billion, much of which is going into AI and data-center infrastructure, yet Alphabet maintains a strong balance sheet to absorb variable returns. A correction of 15% to 20% would lower the valuation to about 22- to 23-times earnings, potentially offering the best entry within the hyperscaler group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DeepSeek's January 2025 reveal triggered a brief panic across AI stocks; hyperscalers slipped 2% to 5%, while AI chip and infrastructure names plunged 15% to 30% before rebounding within days. The takeaway for investors is clear: When the next 15% to 20% correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee - the long-term infrastructure buildout remains intact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Believe the hype: AI is coming for your job. Plan now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     2. Invest in data centers before power constraints are a given </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gartner's November 2024 forecast warns that 40% of AI data centers could face power-availability constraints by 2027, underscoring the physical limits of AI expansion. The firm projects that AI computing workloads alone could consume around 500 terawatt-hours of electricity annually by 2027 - more than two-and-a-half times the 195 TWh used in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dominion Energy (D) is ground zero for the AI power crunch. In Virginia - the world's most populous area for data centers - data-center capacity demand has nearly doubled in just five months, jumping from 21 gigawatts under contract to more than 40. These servers already consume a quarter of the state's electricity, and Dominion expects demand to double again by 2039. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To keep up, Dominion is spending $50 billion over the next five years on new electric-transmission projects and infrastructure upgrades -including an offshore wind project, a solar and battery storage project, and five small modular reactors planned for the 2030s. The stock throws off a 4% to 5% dividend yield, but what really matters is positioning: Dominion isn't just a utility anymore - it's becoming the backbone of the AI era's grid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vistra (VST): Vistra signed a 20-year deal to supply 1,200 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power from its Comanche Peak facility to an investment-grade buyer. It's also adding 860 MW of new gas capacity at its Permian Basin site (boosting it to 1,185 MW) and has outlined up to 2,000 MW of Texas gas additions by 2028 to meet surging data-center and industrial load. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition, data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Digital Realty Trust (DLR): Operates more than 300 data centers globally and has a long record of annual dividend increases. The stock's current dividend yield runs close to 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equinix (EQIX) operates more than 270 data centers serving in excess of 10,000 customers. Last year, the company marked 85 consecutive quarters of top-line growth and said announced projects were more than 85% leased and preleased as of the first quarter of 2025, underscoring demand from hyperscalers and large enterprises. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vertiv (VRT): Nvidia (NVDA) last year partnered with Vertiv for AI data-center builds, and Vertiv's stock has soared. The company's valuation is high, but the stock is riding a market that Goldman Sachs sees jumping to $10.6 billion next year, from $4.1 billion in 2023, as liquid cooling reaches 57% of AI servers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Schneider Electric (FR:SU) (SBGSY): This French multinational is a steadier way to play the data-center theme, with a 24% exposure to data-center end markets and 25% fourth-quarter growth in North American energy management on surging AI demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Conservative investors should build positions in companies poised to profit from the coming power crunch. As AI data centers push grid capacity to its limits, these firms stand to benefit from the multiyear investment cycle required to expand power generation, cooling and infrastructure. With the 2027 constraint window approaching, the next year offers a favorable entry period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     3. Buy what the market has mispriced </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The stock market is committing a cardinal error: indiscriminately punishing profitable companies with documented ROI along with speculative AI startups with no path to profitability. This creates two distinct opportunities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, look at companies that solve unglamorous back-office problems through automation. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UiPath (PATH): UiPath boasts 83% gross margins and its solid client base includes giants such as Orange Spain (FR:ORA) (ORANY) and Travis Perkins (UK:TPK) (TPRKY), yet the stock trades at about four-times sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BlackLine (BL): Third-party studies show triple-digit ROI from BlackLine's close automation - 234% ROI at Creditsafe (12.4-month payback) and 379% ROI at Red Wing (Nucleus Research). BlackLine returned to GAAP profitability in 2024 and authorized a $200 million share repurchase (later increased by another $200 million). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  10-30-25 1936ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

The Air Force Research Lab tracks spacecraft beyond geosynchronous orbit - basically a traffic camera for the Solar System. Because if history teaches us anything, it's that humans can turn any frontier into a border dispute. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     War starts in space (how convenient) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Welcome to the 21st century, where your car's navigation system is a legitimate military target. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the day in 2022 that Russia invaded Ukraine, a cyberattack took out ViaSat's (VSAT) KA-SAT broadband service - a commercial satellite network - across parts of Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Civil aviation has diverted flights repeatedly because of GPS interference around the Baltic. This is the new normal. Welcome to the 21st century, where your car's navigation system is a legitimate military target. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What China and Russia are doing (Spoiler: nothing good) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Space Force officials say five Chinese satellites flew in tight formation last year, closing within meters of each other in coordinated patterns. If you're feeling generous, call it choreography. If you remember Pearl Harbor, call it a dress rehearsal. The Pentagon calls it \"synchronized proximity maneuvers,\" which is what happens when military bureaucrats try to describe dogfighting in space without using the word \"dogfighting.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In 2022, China's Shijian-21 docked with a dead BeiDou satellite and dragged it to a graveyard orbit. Debris removal, they said. Which it was. It's also exactly what you'd do in wartime if you wanted to remove someone else's satellite and make it look like housekeeping. It's the Swiss Army knife problem: It's not a weapon until you use the sharp parts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The international space treaty system is collapsing just as the hardware gets interesting. This has happened before: The Washington and London Naval Treaties limited battleship construction in the 1920s and 1930s, right up until Japan withdrew in 1934 and everyone started building again. World War II followed. It never ends well, but it's always profitable for somebody. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     America's strategy: More is more </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon's answer? The Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Yes, that's its real name. It's a 154-satellite mesh network designed to track missiles and route data around whatever? gets killed first. Launches are running roughly monthly into 2026. This is the Costco model of national defense: buy in bulk, expect casualties, keep the replacements coming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Twenty-one more satellites went up recently for what the Pentagon calls Tranche-1, the first batch of the 154-satellite network. Ten more Falcon 9 launches are already booked. Elon Musk is having a better decade in defense contracting than most people have in life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Space Force has just awarded contracts to SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin for their big launches. They also brought in new companies for smaller missions, which is Washington's way of saying \"We need more vendors because we're about to need a lot of launches.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rocket Lab (RKLB) is the small-launcher outside of SpaceX that works. Rocket Lab is part of the VICTUS HAZE exercise - the sequel to VICTUS NOX, because the military is now doing franchise launches, paired with a startup for rapid-response missions that include on-orbit maneuvering. Rocket Lab also builds spacecraft, which matters because the Pentagon is buying satellites by the hundreds now. Build them and launch them? That's two revenue streams. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The moon is back (unfortunately) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beijing brought back lunar samples in 2024 and is building a Moon base with Russia. Yes, Russia - the country whose satellite-navigation system barely works. This should go well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. is commercializing lunar access. NASA's CLPS program pays private companies to land cargo on the Moon. These are simple delivery contracts, not government megaprojects. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Intuitive Machines (LUNR) landed the first American spacecraft on the Moon since Apollo in 2024. More contracts are coming. This is logistics infrastructure for military and commercial operations between the Earth and the Moon. Watch Intuitive Machine's landing-success rate and contract flow. Either this becomes a business or it doesn't. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Firefly Aerospace followed Intuitive Machines with Blue Ghost in March 2025 - a full 14-day surface mission before the lunar night shut everything down. Firefly is acquiring SciTec for missile-warning analytics, which means they're building a vertical stack: responsive launch, lunar missions, in-space services and defense analytics. This is either visionary integration or an earnings-call disaster. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Debris: The problem everyone ignores until it hits them </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Kinetic antisatellite weapons - the kind that blow things up - make clouds that last decades. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you want something to worry about late at night besides your mortgage, pick orbital debris. Kinetic antisatellite weapons - the kind that blow things up - make clouds that last decades. Everyone knows this. Everyone has an incentive to jam, hack or tow before they smash. That's why debris removal is moving from feel-good environmentalism to actual procurement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Astroscale (JP:186A) (ASRHF) is the pure play here. Debris removal and satellite life extension - Astroscale is the only company where this is the whole business model. Picks-and-shovels for the orbital-trash problem. This Japanese company will either get contracts from governments that suddenly care about space junk, or they won't. If they do, it's a business. If they don't, it's a tax loss. Watch for government contracts and technical demonstrations: actually capturing debris, extending a satellite's life and proving the robotics work in orbit. I'd say watch for revenue, but that might be optimistic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One other cheerful note: The International Space Station deorbits in 2030. NASA plans to bridge to commercial stations, but government schedules are about as reliable as a drunk's promises. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If those slip, China's Tiangong could be the only crewed outpost in orbit for a while. That'll be awkward at the next diplomatic summit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is about money, not destiny </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon doesn't need exquisite systems that do everything perfectly. It needs good-enough systems it can afford to lose and replace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Proliferated constellations and responsive launch means an economic model of lower costs per unit, higher volumes and faster replacement. It's the shift from battleships to PT boats, from handmade suits to off-the-rack ones. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon doesn't need exquisite systems that do everything perfectly. It needs good-enough systems it can afford to lose and replace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors don't need to know when the shooting starts. They need to own the companies that get paid whether it starts or not. That's the beauty of defense contracting: The threat is enough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bottom line </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The question is not whether space defense spending is real, it is whether these companies can execute at scale. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market has already been pricing in this growth. Rocket Lab's stock is up 540% year-to-date. Firefly's stock is down 51% since its IPO - one of the few not following the rally. Intuitive Machines' stock is up 30%. Astroscale's stock is up 18% since listing in Tokyo. The smart money got in two years ago, when these were speculative bets. Now these companies are defense contractors with actual revenue. That does not mean you are late. It means the thesis is proving out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Are these stocks fully valued? Rocket Lab trades at 52 times trailing revenue, with a $1 billion backlog. About 58% of that should convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Space Force contracts currently provide roughly 6% revenue visibility, with more upside ahead as U.S. military demand accelerates. The question is not whether space defense spending is real, it is whether these companies can execute at scale. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  10-30-25 1920ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

And so far this year, Hershey said its chocolate retail sales have returned to growth, they have increased 4% after a previous 1% decline in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the stock (HSY) dropped 2.3% on Thursday, closing at its lowest price since mid-July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     During the third quarter, Reese's Oreo was the \"top new item\" in the candy, mint and gum category, the company said, with retail-sales trends exceeding targets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Reese's Oreo </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Early data shows that Reese's Oreo overindexes with Gen Z and millennial buyers, a priority audience for the brand,\" Tanner said. The company is preparing fresh advertising and partnerships to raise the confectionery's profile on Instagram, TikTok and through live events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Overall, net sales for the third quarter increased 6.5% from a year ago to $3.18 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus revenue estimate of $3.12 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Hershey has managed to boost prices, and as tariff costs have declined, the extra revenue \"only partially mitigates\" inflation from higher cocoa costs, which are still about 70% above levels in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hershey said it expects cocoa prices to come down over time, with a larger global supply surplus expected for the 2025 and 2026 crop thanthe prior season. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Third-quarter net income fell to $276.3 million from $446.3 million in the year-ago quarter, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 handily beat the FactSet consensus EPS estimate of $1.07. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company raised its outlook for 2025 EPS to between $5.90 and $6 from a range of $5.81 to $6. That compares with the analyst EPS projection of $6.02 a share, and with the year-ago level of $9.37 a share. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff in Hershey's stock has turned it negative for the year. It has now slipped 0.4% in 2025, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has advanced 16.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Steve Gelsi </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Christine Ji </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Both companies are spending big on AI, but Google's diversified business and cost discipline could help it pull ahead </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared that AI growth had led to the company's first-ever $100 billion quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wednesday's earnings reports may have shuffled the rankings among Big Tech players. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ever since the launch of ChatGPT three years ago, Alphabet Inc.'s stock (GOOG) (GOOGL) has been fighting off concerns that artificial intelligence would come for Google's search business. On the other hand, investors have largely regarded Meta Platforms Inc. (META) as a winner thanks to the benefits AI confers on its advertising business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson predicted an inflection in the rivalry between the companies after yesterday's reports. Alphabet solidly beat earnings expectations and maintained margins on the heels of strong Google Cloud and Search growth, while Meta missed profit expectations and shared guidance suggesting increasing capital expenditures and operating expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The MoffettNathanson analyst reiterated his buy rating on both companies but raised his Alphabet price target to $305 from $295 while lowering his Meta price target to $875 from $890. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AI capex has been a focal point this earnings season as investors look for proof that these companies can realize a return on the investments made in expensive data-center projects. In this regard, Alphabet appears better positioned, according to a Thursday note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet can spread its capex across its high-growth cloud business, YouTube platform and traditional search entity, Nathanson wrote. On the other hand, Meta \"is reliant on core advertising monetization and a nascent AI business that includes devices.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Meta's stock slides toward its worst day in years as Wall Street pans 'runaway' AI spending </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What once was a wide valuation gap between Meta and Alphabet has closed over the last few months. As recently as July, Alphabet's stock traded at around a 20% discount to the S&amp;P 500 index SPX on a forward price-to-earnings basis, while Meta's stock was trading at a roughly 20% premium, according to MoffettNathanson. Now, both companies are trading at a slight premium to the index. Nathanson predicted Alphabet's stock trading at 25 times 2027 earnings estimates - a 25% premium to the market - due to its higher return on invested capital. He said Meta's stock can trade at 22 times earnings for the same period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Raymond James analyst Josh Beck said Alphabet's stock is still an undervalued opportunity. In a Thursday note, Beck reiterated his buy rating and raised his price target to $315 from $275, based on a 24.5x 2027 P/E ratio. The updated valuation still leaves Alphabet shares trading at around a 20% discount to other big AI winners such as Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), according to Beck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet's rising price-to-earnings multiple to date has been driven in part by continued resilience in its search business and increasing Gemini adoption. As Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a Thursday note, \"Search picked up again despite AI chatbots taking share of queries. As long as AI is helping drive growth in clicks and cost-per-click, investors will like this dynamic.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared on the earnings call that AI growth drove the company's first-ever $100 billion quarter in revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's third-quarter earnings showed strong top-line growth, as well. Revenue grew 26%, beating Wall Street expectations of 22%. However, Meta's costs have grown at a faster rate than revenues have, Nathanson highlighted, due to increasing depreciation and employment expenses, even after adjusting for one-time expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Alphabet gained 2.5% and shares of Meta sank 11% on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Can Google overtake Nvidia as the world's most valuable company?
