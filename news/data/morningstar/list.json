I went over the options with the major financial group holding the IRA. I made a choice based on the information given, but I admit published IRA rules and the Secure Act 2.0 left me confused about which was the best choice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative told me that I would be able to change my choice if I was not satisfied. After mulling things over, I felt I wanted to change my choice but when I called back I was told by another representative presumably higher up the food chain that this was not so. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given that all conversations were on a recorded line, I requested a copy of the pertinent conversations regarding this matter. I was told they did not provide copies of these conversations. Is this another thing in life we need to get a lawyer for? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your thoughts please. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bamboozled Beneficiary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: I'm in my 70s. Should I take the tax hit and withdraw all of my inherited IRA to avoid required minimum distributions? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Bamboozled, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As if a personal loss leading to an inherited account wasn't enough, financial headaches make the situation all the more stressful. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're right in that inherited account options, as well as many other retirement plan decisions, are complicated, and the published rules or changes under any new law do not always make them easier to understand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, let's review the options for a spouse who inherits an IRA. The two main avenues are rolling the money over into an IRA in the inheritor's own name or transferring the assets to an inherited IRA, though someone could also either take a lump-sum distribution or disclaim the assets if they so wished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spouses get to do the option to roll over the money into an IRA under their own name. They can use a new or existing IRA. This option can be quite tax-advantageous, especially if you don't need the money anytime soon and are not close to the current RMD age, which is 73 years old. For instance, if your spouse had already reached 73 but you haven't, you don't have to take those required minimum distributions even if your spouse had taken them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about retirement, Social Security, where to live or how to afford it at all? We want to hear from you. Join the conversation in our Facebook community: Retire Better with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are caveats, however. If your wife was taking RMDs before but hadn't in the year of her death, you would have to do so now. \"This RMD is calculated based on the longer of the remaining life expectancy or your spouse's single-life expectancy,\" according to Fidelity Investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another caveat: If you're under 59 1/2 years old and you do end up needing to draw down some of that money, you'd be hit with a 10% penalty if the money is in an account under your name before you reach that age for penalty-free distributions. However, you could convert the money to a Roth account after rolling it into an account under your name. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The second avenue is to transfer the money into an inherited IRA, which would avoid that 10% penalty for distributions for those under 59 1/2 years old. With this option, you either can begin RMDs in the year after the year of death or you can wait until the year in which your wife would have turned 73. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The starting date depends on whether your wife was of RMD age. If she was taking her RMDs, you would have to take the RMD for the year if she hadn't done so yet, and then you can begin taking RMDs based on your life expectancy in the year after the year of her death, and thereafter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If your wife had not yet reached her RMD age, then you can either take the RMD by Dec. 31 of the year after the year of death or, if later, by the end of the year that your wife would have reached her RMD age. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can always decide to go from an inherited spouse IRA to your own IRA down the road,\" Stephen Maggard, a certified financial planner at Abacus Planning Group. The reverse, however, is not possible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lawyering up </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Getting attorneys involved can bring along its own stresses, as well as costs, so you should only do so if you're sure that you have suffered financial damage and you believe you could get something out of the whole process. Before doing so, try sending the firm a written request for the recorded call. Alternatively, an attorney might be able to get a hold of that recorded call with a subpoena. However, many businesses do not provide copies of recorded conversations unless they receive a subpoena, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to HG.org, an online legal resource. \"A subpoena is a request for certain documents to be produced, usually made by an attorney who is representing a client in a pending case who believes that the information requested will prove or disprove a component of the case.\" If a business fails to comply when it does not have a defense, it adds, the party can be subject to civil or criminal penalties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide not to use an attorney, but you still want to try and get a hold of that recording, you can file a complaint with regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or your state regulator. Make sure you have all of your facts straight - as much detail as you can remember about what the representative told you, and the options made available to you, and all relevant documentation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By submitting your story to Dow Jones &amp; Co., the publisher of MarketWatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Have a question about your own retirement savings?

These statements caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase and/or acquire VFC's securities at artificially inflated prices.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The truth emerged on May 21, 2025, when VFC reported its fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results, highlighting a significant decline in Vans' growth trajectory, which faltered from an 8% loss the quarter before to a 20% loss in the fourth quarter, and noting such decline would continue through the next quarter. The Company attributed its results and below-expectation guidance largely as \"a direct effect of deliberately reduced revenue to eliminate unprofitable or unproductive businesses\" and \"an additional set of deliberate actions\" already in-place but previously unannounced. VFC further noted that, disregarding these deliberate actions, Vans would still have shown a \"high single digit[]\" revenue decline, suggesting growth slowed in comparison to the prior years' sequential improvements irrespective of management's new \"deliberate actions.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Investors and analysts reacted immediately to VFC's revelation. The price of VFC's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $14.43 per share on May 20, 2025, VFC's stock price fell to $12.15 per share on May 21, 2025, a decline of about 15.8% in the span of just a single day.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The economy is still afloat in an ocean of uncertainty </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Is the sun setting on the U.S. economy? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors are set to miss out on the second U.S. jobs report in a row due to the government shutdown, but there's enough scattered evidence to suggest the economy is hanging in there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the shutdown now passing the one-month mark, the U.S. Labor Department probably won't be able to publish the October employment report next Friday as scheduled. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The second postponed jobs report in a row has made it hard for investors and senior Federal Reserve officials to figure out if the economy is getting better or worse. Hiring had almost grinded to a halt by the end of summer, alarming the Fed enough to push the central bank to start cutting interest rates again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Absent the usual signposts, Wall Street has had to turn to other indicators such as credit-card spending, corporate earning results and state jobless claims to try to piece together what is going on. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What they show is an economy that's still expanding even amid a cloud of uncertainty - the shutdown, trade wars, the sharp slowdown in hiring. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Let's start with credit-card spending. Bank of America found that weekly spending was up almost 1% in the seven days ended Oct. 25 compared to the same period a week earlier. Not great, but not bad either. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial, said customers in the 15 states in which the bank has branches continue to spend at a similar pace as before the government shutdown. \"So far I haven't found anything at odds,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Business spending, meanwhile, has also held up well, largely because of the ongoing boom in investment in artificial intelligence. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) all said this week that they would ramp up AI investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A big reason why they can invest more is because sales and profits remain quite healthy, a testament in part to solid consumer spending. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The latest round of [quarterly corporate] earnings reports don't suggest an economy that is about to roll over,\" Moody said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve on Wednesday also seemed to suggest the economy may have improved a bit since late summer. While the Fed still cut interest rates because of worries about a soft labor market, senior officials also sounded an optimistic note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The economy is showing continued momentum. Consumption remains solid,\" said Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed. He was the lone dissenter who preferred no rate cut given the residual strength of the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The risk of recession is not on \"people's minds,\" added Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Fed officials would dearly love to see the monthly employment reports resume to get a more realistic appraisal of the economy. Now they have to look at alternative or lesser measures to guide their decisions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for his part, took comfort in data showing new applications for unemployment benefits remain low. He also noted that private-sector surveys of job openings were stable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We are not seeing an uptick in jobless claims or a downtick, really, in [job] openings,\" Powell said on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The resilience of the economy and a seeming stable, if softer, labor market helps to explain why Powell went out of his way to say another rate cut in December is not a \"foregone conclusion - far from it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some Wall Street firms even think the economy will pick up a bit of steam at year-end.

Management will be looking to convince investors that the company's chips are resonating, beyond a recent 6-gigawatt agreement with OpenAI that won't become much of a factor until the latter part of next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While the OpenAI deal is focused on next-generation chips, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri will be watching trends in the current MI355x line as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Our sense is that, following the initial tool-up in [the second half], many customers seem to be pausing on MI355x and waiting for MI455 racks next year - not a huge issue, but something we think about given the recent rally in shares after signing the [OpenAI] deal,\" Arcuri wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's why OpenAI wants a stake in AMD </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's also interested in how customers are viewing AMD's graphics processing units relative to application-specific integrated circuits from Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Companies are diversifying beyond Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), but when it comes to Nvidia alternatives, \"recently things seem to have tilted in favor of ASICs,\" Arcuri noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Google shows off its semiconductor prowess with a new Anthropic deal </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That said, there's more to AMD's business than AI accelerators. \"No one really talks about servers as much as they do accelerators, but the server business has bounced back pretty nicely,\" Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the company's last earnings call, Chief Executive Lisa Su said that AMD's businesses of selling central processing units for servers and personal computers were \"accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio and expanded go-to-market investments.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"All of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well,\" she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How much AMD's earnings will move the stock remains to be seen, since so much of its recent momentum stems from business that's farther out than the present day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But for now, the setup into the print as a result admittedly looks solid; core markets (PCs, servers) are looking better in the near term, they continue to take oodles of share, and as the OpenAI ramp doesn't even start for a year, a tremendous amount of pressure has probably been removed from any nearer-term AI expectations,\" Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon wrote recently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rasgon asked whether anyone would really care if AMD missed AI expectations for the fourth quarter, given the magnitude of what lies ahead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Can AMD's stock live up to the hype? Depends on how you look at it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In looking at overall third-quarter expectations, analysts tracked by FactSet are calling for $1.17 in adjusted earnings per share on revenue of $8.8 billion. For the fourth quarter, the consensus view calls for $1.32 in adjusted EPS and $9.2 billion in total revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This also won't be the only time investors are hearing from management in the near future, as the company is due to host an investor day on Nov. 11. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We think AMD may opt to hold off on big news until then,\" Arcuri wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks just logged their best midyear stretch since 1950. Is it time to take some profits? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its best midyear stretch since the 1950s. Now it's a question of taking some profits or holding for a rally at year-end. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the S&amp;P 500 on pace for a 16% yearly gain already, investors find themselves at a familiar crossroads: lock in profits while they are hot, or stay greedy and bet on a typical year-end rally that could push stocks to new highs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 SPX just defied one of Wall Street's most entrenched seasonal clichés - \"sell in May and go away\" - with its strongest May-through-October stretch since 1950. Historically, this six-month stretch is the worst seasonal period for stocks, with an average gain of only 2.1%, according to data compiled by LPL Financials. But this time, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 22.9% during the period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up nearly 17% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP surged 36%, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     History also shows that when stocks resist the \"sell in May\" slump with double-digit summer gains, the rally often has more room to run. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 12% from November through April in such cases, outpacing the market's usual 7% return during its most favorable six-month window, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial (see chart below). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     SOURCE: LPL Research, Bloomberg </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As October drew to a close, investors turned their attentions to the final two months of the year - a period that's historically bullish - while wondering whether a year-end rally is already underway. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     History suggests that the S&amp;P 500 has shined the brightest in November and December, averaging a 3.1% gain during those two-month periods since 1945, while logging positive returns 76% of the time, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To be sure, seasonal trends do not always translate into reality and should always be viewed in the context of current market conditions. Seasonality simply reflects the broader market climate rather than the immediate setup on Wall Street - meaning stock performance through year-end doesn't have to follow any seasonal script, LPL's Turnquist noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After all, \"economic conditions, earnings, geopolitics, along with fiscal, monetary and trade policy, are much bigger drivers of price action\" in the stock market this year, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stovall told MarketWatch that macro forces also support the case for a year-end rally. His CFRA team continues to see stock prices advancing through the end of 2025 on \"an improvement in earnings-growth expectations\" combined with potentially another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're still looking for two Fed rate cuts in 2026, so that could also help to shore up stock prices, at least through the end of April,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Will the Fed cut interest rates in December? Here's what experts are saying. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. central bank last week voted to lower the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 3.75% and 4%, and officially announced its plan to stop shrinking its portfolio of assets beginning Dec. 1. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned investors against assuming another rate reduction will follow in December, saying it's \"not a foregone conclusion\". </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As a result, investors have scaled back expectations for a December rate cut, with fed-funds futures traders on Friday only pricing in a 69% chance of a rate reduction at the end of the year, down from 90% before the October policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Here's what a government shutdown means for markets - and your wallet </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, investors can't ignore the political storm clouds gathering in Washington. The ongoing government shutdown - now stretching into its second month - is beginning to ripple through the economy and straining American households. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The longer the government shutdown lasts, the bigger of a potential drag it could have on consumer confidence, said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at SimCorp. \"So far, we haven't seen the impact, but I've got to imagine that eventually we are going to see the impact, as people are not getting paid or [receiving] food benefits,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, while also scoring weekly and monthly gains. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 2.3% in October, while the Dow was up 2.5% and the Nasdaq surged 4.7% for the month, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Joy Wiltermuth contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are glimmers of hope - from nanotechnology and brain games, to diet and exercise </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not all of the findings require medical intervention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How likely are you to develop Alzheimer's, or another form of dementia, when you get older? The chances are probably a lot better than you think. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About half-a-million Americans develop dementia every year, and that figure is projected to double to 1 million by 2060. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Researchers earlier this year reported that those over the age of 55 have about a 42% chance of developing dementia before they die, or more than  a 2-in-5 probability. That includes more than a third of men and nearly half of women. Women face a higher risk because they typically live longer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the good news is that promising new research on how to treat dementia has been coming on multiple fronts lately. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A team of scientists from China, Barcelona and London have just reported that they have been able to use nanotechnology to reverse the symptoms of dementia in mice. Their technology got the brain to clear away as much as 45% of the amyloid-beta protein clumps associated with dementia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's pretty exciting,\" says Dr. Jagan Pillai at the Cleveland Clinic, a neurologist who is an expert in dementia. He says the research is especially interesting because it offers a new way for scientists to think about removing these damaging proteins. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     David Gates, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, says the findings are \"highly intriguing\" and represent \"a pretty clever strategy\" for removing amyloid from the brain. But, he adds, the findings are \"very preliminary and need replication. I am interested to see where they take it, but it is far from being used clinically on humans.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The researchers themselves, contacted by MarketWatch, confirmed that even if all their research continues to go well, it would be five to seven years before human trials. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But that's a lot better than nothing - which, until recently, was all medicine could offer those with dementia. If one of the world's most famous people, the actor Bruce Willis, can't be helped, what is available for the rest of us? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And the latest development isn't an isolated instance: Promising and hopeful research in dementia has been coming thick and fast of late. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several studies this year - such as this one from Bristol University in Britain, this one from Galway in Ireland, and this one from Britain's Cambridge University - have found that drugs already on the market, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, can help materially lower your risk of getting dementia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another study, based on data from Wales, found that vaccinating people against shingles may lower their risk of getting dementia by 20%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And a global team of researchers led by those at Washington University in St. Louis have reported promising findings from a specific experimental drug designed to reduce amyloid plaques in the brain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But just as interesting are the findings that aren't about medical interventions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, researchers at McGill University in Toronto have just published research that regular use of a popular brain-training app on your phone, BrainHQ, can make your brain younger. A 10-week study undid about 10 years' worth of brain aging, they found. Astonishing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A study published recently in the journal Nature confirmed that various versions of the so-called Mediterranean diet - meaning whole grains, fresh vegetables and fruit, fish, olive oil and so on - lower your risk of getting dementia. (Lots of red meat, processed foods and sugar, meanwhile, raise your risk.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And a new paper in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry reports that finding purpose in your life seems to cut your risk of getting dementia. (This may not come as a surprise to anyone who has read Viktor Frankl's memoir, \"Man's Search for Meaning.\") </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Scientists are also learning more about the causes of dementia, such as pollution, insomnia and drinking alcohol. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A recent report in the American Journal of Medicine concluded that up to 45% of dementia cases might be prevented through things we can do on our own - including eating right, getting exercise and staying socially involved in our older years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     (Earlier this year, researchers reported that staying sociable could delay dementia by a remarkable five years.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The social and economic burden of dementia is devastating: The University of Southern California puts the figure at $781 billion this year, though that's just an estimate. They reckon family and friends spend 6.8 billion hours looking after people with dementia, which they value at $233 billion, or $34 an hour. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But those gloomy projections for the future rest on two pessimistic assumptions: First, that individuals and society as a whole won't take the steps needed to slash the risks; and second, that scientists won't find massive breakthroughs in treatment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Will those assumptions prove correct? Stay tuned. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account.

It will receive a step-up in basis as an inheritance. With IRA withdrawals and Social Security, this man is enjoying some well-earned gravy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors should not make decisions about their portfolio based on a feared downturn in the S&amp;P 500 SPX.

Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm.

It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78.
