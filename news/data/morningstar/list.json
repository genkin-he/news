As conversations around consent and sexual wellness continue to evolve, Dr. Laino emphasizes that condoms are not just about prevention - they help create a shared understanding of responsibility, reduce anxiety around unintended consequences, and allow couples to be more present with one another.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Being responsible and using condoms should feel seamless, not awkward,” says Dr. Laino. “When you feel confident and comfortable, you can focus on the chemistry, the closeness, and the experience you’re creating together - which is what truly enhances pleasure and connection.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWhen used correctly and consistently, condoms remain one of the most effective and accessible methods for helping prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. But beyond protection, they can also increase emotional safety, build mutual trust, and remove distractions or worry that can interfere with intimacy - ultimately allowing partners to feel more relaxed, confident, and connected in the moment.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAmong one of the newest sexual health innovations is <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trojanbrands.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fcondoms%2Ftrojan-goat-non-latex-lubricated-condoms&amp;esheet=54435690&amp;newsitemid=20260227512574&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Trojan+G.O.A.T.%26%238482%3B+%28Greatest+of+All+Trojan%29&amp;index=1&amp;md5=381cf76f158d740af1f7cf2b11a378fe\" tabindex=\"0\">Trojan G.O.A.T.™ (Greatest of All Trojan)</a> from Trojan Brand Condoms.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Grok will let its model be used for classified purposes, while Anthropic has balked at the idea that its products could be used for mass surveillance </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that artificial intelligence has the capabilities to undermine democratic values. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump on Friday ordered the U.S. government to stop using Anthropic's artificial-intelligence models and threatened the company with \"major\" consequences. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Anthropic better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump directed all federal agencies to immediately stop using Anthropic's Claude AI models. He added that the Department of Defense and other U.S. agencies have six months to phase out Anthropic's technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. On Thursday, Anthropic said it would work to enable a \"smooth transition\" to another provider. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's announcement comes after days of public and private back-and-forth negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic that occasionally turned ugly. After Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei defended his company's refusal to budge on Thursday, a Pentagon official accused him of trying to \"personally control the U.S. military.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, wrote on X. Michael, a former executive at Uber Technologies (UBER), also accused Anthropic of having a plan to \"impose\" its values on Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conflict stems from Anthropic's contract with the Defense Department, which is worth up to $200 million. Anthropic has drawn a line in the sand over how the agency can use its technology. Specifically, Anthropic doesn't want its products to be used to develop autonomous weapons or for mass surveillance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon has said it has \"no interest\" in using AI for those purposes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,\" Amodei wrote Thursday. \"Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today's technology can safely and reliably do.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But that didn't square with a Jan. 9 memo handed down by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that calls for AI labs to amend their defense contracts to allow \"any lawful use\" of their technology. Hegseth gave the department 180 days to insert that standard into any contract that involves procuring AI services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"DoD does not want a private company's usage policy to function as a veto over lawful military applications,\" Jessica Tillipman, a professor at George Washington University's law school who specializes in government procurement law, told MarketWatch over email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If DoD makes this the default clause across all AI vendors, it eliminates vendor-by-vendor negotiation over acceptable use and signals that firms unwilling to accept that baseline will be replaced,\" Tillipman said. \"It sounds like boring contract boilerplate, but it is really about procurement leverage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following Trump's announcement, Hegseth formally declared Anthropic as a supply-chain risk to national security, a designation previously applied only to foreign companies. As a result, no contractor, supplier or partner that does business with the U.S. military can \"conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That has potentially major implications for Anthropic, which recently raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation and disclosed $14 billion in annual run-rate revenue, driven mostly by increasing enterprise adoption of its products. More than 500 business customers now spend over $1 million annually on Anthropic's products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), which alongside Nvidia (NVDA) signed a strategic partnership with Anthropic last November, works with the Defense Department.  Amazon (AMZN), which has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic, recently detailed a plan to support the Pentagon through access to Amazon Web Services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before this week, Claude was the only AI model approved for classified use in the Pentagon. Claude was even used, through a Palantir Technologies (PLTR) partnership, to help the U.S. capture Venezuela's then president, Nicolás Maduro, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Elon Musk's xAI signed a deal to allow its controversial Grok model to be used for classified purposes earlier this week. Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns over potential safety issues with Grok, the Journal reports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A senior Pentagon official told MarketWatch that other companies are close to a similar agreement that would allow their AI models to be used for classified work. OpenAI and Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google have made versions of their AI models, ChatGPT and Gemini, available on the Defense Department's GenAI.mil enterprise platform used by civilian and military personnel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Representatives for Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Amazon, Nvidia and SoftBank pour $110 billion into OpenAI - raising the stakes for AI monetization </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The money is not currently in a bank account and it is not part of an estate - let's assume it's just cash in an envelope - and I live in a state with no inheritance tax. I assume I can make this deposit legally and that there will be no tax consequences. Am I correct? Must I provide a recent death certificate? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lone Ranger </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 2025 has been one hell of a year. Consumers should expect more 'silent pain' in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how this money was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope - and I'm not sure I want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In any case, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect potential money laundering. It does not mean that you have done anything wrong, so as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong, it should not create a problem for you. But there should be a paper trail in case you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What if you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? Deliberately breaking up financial transactions to avoid triggering reports that are required by law is called \"structuring,\" and it's illegal. The authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a magnifying glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and was not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of a death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's death. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax versus estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the bank teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent, the bank might request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Binges with subtitles: Released in February, the comedy-mystery series \"How to Get to Heaven from Belfast,\" from \"Derry Girls\" creator Lisa McGee, is a charming though overly twisty romp set in Northern Ireland, as three old friends investigate the apparent death of their former classmate. Though the characters are different, the vibes are very much \"Derry Girls\"-plus 20 years, and there are a couple of winks to the hit comedy. There's also the propulsive espionage thriller \"Unfamiliar,\" about a pair of former spies whose quiet family life in Berlin is suddenly thrown into a violent game of cat and mouse after a Russian spymaster looks to cover up a nearly two-decade-old operation. Part Jason Bourne, part \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" it's a quick and intense binge. One red flag: It ends on a cliffhanger, and Season 2 has not been green-lit yet, despite the show shooting to the top of Netflix's charts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Play, pause or stop?

The Australian \"Odd Couple\"-like comedy/mystery shifts to the tropical north of Darwin this time around, as boorish detective Eddie (Madeline Sami) investigates the death of her former partner, aided by straightlaced Tasmanian cop Dulcie (Kate Box). Season 1 deftly balanced slapstick comedy with darker themes of violence and misogyny in an utterly addictive season. Hopes are high that the series can pull a repeat. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, the hit animated superhero drama \"Invincible\" (March 18) is back for its fourth season - which is, mercifully, not split in half again. After last season's global catastrophe, we pick up the action with Mark (Steven Yeun) struggling with guilt as yet another threat emerges. And a few years after the surprise success of the documentary-style comedy \"Jury Duty,\" a sequel is on the way: \"Jury Duty Presents: Company Retreat\" (March 20), as a newly hired intern is thrown into a world of chaos during a corporate getaway. The twist, of course, is that while he thinks it's all real, everyone else is an actor orchestrating crazy scenarios to test his responses. Season 1 was a delight; can lightning strike twice? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon's (AMZN) streaming service also has \"Young Sherlock\" (March 4), a new series from Guy Ritchie, delving into the iconic detective's origins as a student at Oxford; \"Scarpetta\" (March 11), a new mystery series starring Nicole Kidman as a crime-solving medical examiner, based on the bestselling book series by Patricia Cornwell; \"Meal Ticket\" (March 19), a documentary about the McDonald's All-America high-school basketball games; \"Bait\" (March 26), a comedy series starring Riz Ahmed as a struggling actor whose life spins out of control over one wild week; \"Pretty Lethal\" (March 25), an action movie about five ballerinas trapped in the woods who must fight for their survival; Season 2 of the biblical drama \"House of David\" (March 27); and Season 2 of the British reality competition \"Last One Laughing\" (date TBA), as a roomful of comedians try to crack each other up, and the last one to hold it together wins. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And don't forget a full slate of NBA games, as the playoff push begins. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Play, pause or stop? Pause and think it over. There's some high potential this month, particularly with \"Deadloch\" and \"Company Retreat.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hulu ($11.99 a month with ads, or $18.99 with no ads) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hulu will live-stream the Oscars (March 15) for the first time, along with ABC's red-carpet coverage. This is an obvious upgrade, since it always seemed odd to stream the awards a day later, once everyone already knew the winners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hulu's also got weekly episodes of ABC's \"American Idol,\" Season 4 of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" (March 12), ABC's new private-eye drama \"RJ Decker\" (March 4), Season 4 of \"Celebrity Jeopardy All Stars\" (March 14), a new season of ABC's \"The Bachelorette\" (March 23), and \"Mike &amp; Nick &amp; Nick &amp; Alice\" (March 27), a buddy action-comedy movie about two friends who get mixed up in the criminal underworld, starring Vince Vaughn, James Marsden and Eiza Gonzalez. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the best things to stream will likely be the ongoing seasons of the soapy-but-addictive post-apocalyptic thriller \"Paradise\" and the revived hospital comedy \"Scrubs,\" which both premiered in late February, along with Ryan Murphy's surprisingly decent body-horror drama \"The Beauty\" (finale March 4). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Drop the Puck: Between HBO Max's \"Heated Rivalry\" and the Winter Olympics, hockey has been having a moment. And if you feel the need  to scratch that itch even more, look no further than Season 5 of \"Shoresy,\" which dropped in February. Jared Keeso stars in this \"Letterkenny\" spinoff satirizing performative masculinity among a small-town Canadian hockey team. Extremely raunchy but surprisingly heartfelt, it allows its characters to both be knucklehead bros yet grow and display depth at the most surprising moments. The first 10 minutes of the current season's premiere episode perfectly encapsulate the show: Five minutes of an extended (and hilarious) masturbation joke followed by five minutes of a tender and inspirational heart-to-heart with a struggling junior player that'll put a tear in your eye. And while this season is probably the weakest of the series, it's still a blast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Play, pause or stop? Pause. \"Paradise\" and \"Scrubs\" are very watchable, and the Oscars will be good for cord-cutters, but there's a steep drop-off after that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple TV ($12.99 a month) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's another fairly busy month for Apple (AAPL), topped by the premiere of the psychological-thriller series \"Imperfect Women\" (March 18), starring Elisabeth Moss, Kerry Washington and Kate Mara as three lifelong friends whose lives are shattered after one is killed, and her secrets are revealed. Unfortunately, that seems like the plot to about a dozen recent streaming shows. It'll be a challenge to elevate it beyond generic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's also Season 5 of \"For All Mankind\" (March 27), the uneven alternate-history sci-fi drama that peaked in Season 2 and has seen diminishing returns since. Joel Kinnaman (who also co-stars in \"Imperfect Women\" and Netflix's \"Detective Hole\") returns with about 8 pounds of makeup as crusty, now-elderly astronaut Ed Baldwin, whose little rebellion at the end of Season 4 worked out pretty well, with the Mars colony, aka Happy Valley, now thriving - though tensions with Earth are building. The show tends to veer from engrossing to ridiculous, often in the same episode, but the underlying concept remains compelling enough to earn a wary thumbs-up (in many ways, much like Hulu's \"Paradise\"). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And after resolving a plagiarism dispute that delayed its release last year, the French-language thriller \"The Hunt,\" about a deadly encounter between two groups of hunters, is finally landing on March 4. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple's also got weekly episodes of \"Hijack\" (season finale March 4), \"Drops of God\" (season finale March 11), \"The Last Thing He Told Me,\" \"Monarch: Legacy of Monsters\" and \"Shrinking.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, the Israeli spy thriller \"Tehran,\" which just completed its third season, has been shaken by the sudden death of showrunner Dana Eden amid production for its fourth season. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vroom vroom: In addition to becoming the new streaming home of Formula 1 racing (starting March 7), Apple has reached an agreement in which the current season of Netflix's megahit docuseries \"F1: Drive to Survive\" will also stream on Apple. In return, Netflix will get to stream the Canadian Grand Prix live to its U.S. audience in May. Apple also has the Brad Pitt movie \"F1,\" so... hooray for corporate synergy! </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Play, pause or stop? Pause. There are good shows here, but with the possible exception of \"Shrinking,\" probably none that stand out as reasons to subscribe. F1 fans may beg to differ though. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Paramount+ ($8.99 a month with ads, $13.99 a month Premium with no ads) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Our long national nightmare is over: Paramount+ has gone more than a month without a Taylor Sheridan show, but that situation will be rectified in March with not one, but two, new Sheridan-produced shows. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Get ready for more sweeping  shots of Montana's natural beauty in \"The Madison\" (March 14), an intimate family drama starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell as a couple coping with a family tragedy played out between Manhattan and the Big Sky state. There's also the \"Yellowstone\" spinoff \"Marshals\" (March 1), a CBS drama that sees Luke Dutton (Luke Grimes) leaving the ranch to join the U.S. Marshals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In non-Sheridan shows, longtime \"Top Chef\" host Padma Lakshmi has a new cooking-competition show on CBS, \"America's Culinary Cup\" (March 4), pitting 16 chefs against each other to master the \"10 culinary commandments\" (you'll have to watch to figure out what that means). With six Michelin-starred chefs and 14 James Beard Award nominees, including two-time \"Top Chef\" winner Buddha Lo, this could put some heat on \"Top Chef,\" which also returns this month on Peacock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Paramount's also got a new season of the true-crime docuseries \"FBI True\" (March 31); the \"female Viagra\" documentary \"The Pink Pill: Sex, Drugs &amp; Who Has Control\" (March 8), premiering just in time for International Women's Day; and the season finales of \"School Spirts\" (March 4), \"Star Trek: Starfleet Academy\" (March 12) and \"Dreaming Whilst Black\" (March 27). Don't forget weekly episodes of CBS shows including \"Tracker,\" \"Watson\" and \"NCIS.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sports-wise, there's a full slate of college basketball before March Madness tips off March 19. Rule of thumb for the men's NCAA Tournament: If it's a CBS game, it'll stream on Paramount; if it's on TBS, TNT or TruTV, it'll be on HBO Max. There's also European soccer (including UEFA Champions League Round of 16), NWSL (starting March 13) and UFC fight nights. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  02-27-26 1751ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 24, 2026.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">So What: If you purchased Lakeland securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">What to do next: To join the Lakeland class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629574-1&amp;h=75577555&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50020&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50020\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50020</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 24, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Lakeland was experiencing significant, sustained issues with its Pacific Helmets and Jolly businesses, including, inter alia, shipping-related delays, production issues, and slower than expected rollout of new products; (2) accordingly, defendants overstated the anticipated and actual positive impact of these businesses on Lakeland's financial results, as well as the overall strength and quality of Pacific Helmets' and Jolly's respective operations; (3) Lakeland's business and financial results were significantly deteriorating because of, inter alia, tariff-related headwinds and timing, certification delays, and material flow issues in its acquired businesses; (4) accordingly, defendants overstated the strength of their tariff mitigation measures and \"small, strategic, and quick\" (\"SSQ\") M&amp;A strategy; (5) as a result of all the foregoing issues, defendants' financial guidance was unreliable; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Lakeland class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629574-1&amp;h=75577555&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50020&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50020\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50020</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. OpenAI shut down Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account after detecting a violation of its policy but didn't notify police. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon said he's also scheduled to speak to OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman next week. A spokeswoman for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Solomon said the timing and location have yet to be determined. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A meeting with Solomon marks the second senior Canadian politician Altman has agreed to speak with. British Columbia Premier David Eby said he's also set to speak to Altman, and Eby added he wants the CEO to be cognizant of the pain that families in Tumbler Ridge are feeling. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Online platforms have long debated how to balance questions of privacy with public safety in their decisions to alert law enforcement about certain users. That debate has now pulled in the AI companies that power the chatbots to which people are confiding the most intimate details of their private thoughts and lives. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In its letter to Solomon, OpenAI divulged that Van Rootselaar had a second ChatGPT account. Among OpenAI's pledges is a commitment to strengthen detection systems to prevent efforts to evade safeguards. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Taylor Owen, a public-policy professor at Montreal's McGill University with a specialty in media and ethics, said OpenAI has now publicly acknowledged its previous safety protocols were inadequate, and that Van Rootselaar's ability to create a second account discloses a previously unknown system error. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"It means the threshold that governed the original decision, the one that resulted in Canadian police not being contacted about violent content flagged by the company's own systems, was one the company itself now considers inadequate,\" Owen said. OpenAI's pledges, he added, follows a pattern among social-media platforms \"where product safety changes come only after an incident forces them.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon said he will press Altman about ensuring the pledges are fully implemented and enforced. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"We will be seeking further clarity on how human review is conducted and whether Canadian context and best practices are appropriately embedded in those decisions,\" the minister said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Solomon added that intends to meet other major digital platforms in the coming weeks to advocate for a consistent approach on protecting youths and the public. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 17:29 ET (22:29 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
