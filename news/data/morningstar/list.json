            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Megumi Fujikawa </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  TOKYO--Inflation in Japan's capital cooled below the central bank's 2% target for the first time in over a year, but the slowdown is unlikely to derail further interest rate hikes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While the headline figure eased, underlying price pressures in Tokyo--considered a leading indicator of nationwide trends--remain firm, with the bulk of the slowdown due to the impact of government subsidies, Friday's data showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Excluding fresh food, consumer prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area rose 1.8% in February from a year earlier, compared with the 2.0% increase seen in January. The deceleration was driven largely by a 9.2% plunge in energy prices after the government rolled out subsidies to help households cope with rising living costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That marked the first time the Tokyo gauge has fallen below the Bank of Japan's 2% target since October 2024, but the print likely won't shift expectations on monetary policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central bank has been maintaining a cautious but positive stance on further interest-rate hikes following a round of tightening that brought the policy rate to 0.75% in December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute economist Takuya Hoshino said the Tokyo data was \"broadly firm,\" pointing out that service prices, which have a strong correlation with wage growth, rose 1.5%, up slightly from January. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A core measure of inflation which strips out volatile fresh food and energy prices also edged up to 2.5% in February. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While consumer inflation excluding fresh food continued to slow, \"the results are unlikely to deter the BOJ from raising interest rates further,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant agreed, saying that the slew of economic indicators, including inflation figures, released Friday \"suggest that the BOJ won't wait much longer before hiking rates again.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Markets are currently pricing in a nearly 60% chance of a rate hike in April, according to data from money market broker Tokyo Tanshi. Traders and BOJ officials are closely monitoring how Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's planned sales tax cut will affect price trends. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Separate government data on Friday meanwhile signaled that consumption remains solid, with retail sales rising 1.8% in January from a year earlier. Industrial production rose 2.2% on the month in January on the back of front-loaded demand ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, a sharp reversal from December's 0.1% decrease. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Still, there is continued uncertainty around the outlook for Japanese manufacturers. If weakness in the sector drags on broader economic growth, that could dent the case for rate hikes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While the U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down so-called reciprocal tariffs, Japanese officials have warned that automobile levies continue to weigh on the industry and said they will continue monitoring the impact of President Trump's new tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Policymakers say the nation's corporate sector remains resilient despite the headwinds posed by U.S. trade policy, but Friday's data showed factory activity is expected to weaken again in the coming months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Norinchukin Research Institute economist Takeshi Minami said increasing tensions between Japan and China could weigh on production down the road. Earlier this week, China said that it will ban the export of items that have potential military applications, targeting a list of Japanese companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Diplomatic tensions between the two countries have intensified following Takaichi's remarks last year suggesting Japan's potential involvement in any conflict over Taiwan. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 21:59 ET (02:59 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

This \"speed bump\" was implemented in September 2022 when the yuan faced renewed downward pressure amid a surging dollar and a slowing Chinese economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Friday's move came as the Chinese currency hit a nearly three-year-high against a weakening greenback in recent days. This strong performance also buoyed regional currencies from China's close trading partners such as South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand amid trade uncertainties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While Beijing has recently signaled more tolerance for a stronger yuan, Chinese officials have also frequently warned against bumpy currency fluctuations that could hurt exporters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Over the past decade, the PBOC has adjusted the requirement ratio on foreign-exchange forward trading several times to manage the yuan. The ratio could be re-imposed if concerns about the Chinese currency's appreciation abate. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Singapore Editors at singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 21:30 ET (02:30 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

In response to persistent above-target inflation, the Bank of Japan has continued to normalise its monetary policy, raising the benchmark interest rate to 0.75% in December 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Despite economic uncertainties, including the pace and magnitude of further benchmark rate hikes and persisting depreciation pressure on the Japanese yen, the fundamentals of Japan’s life insurance segment remain sound, supported by steady premium growth and an improving investment environment with higher domestic interest rates,” said Charles Chiang, senior financial analyst, AM Best.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAccording to the report, the life industry’s annualised premiums in force have remained broadly steady due to consistently low economic growth and an ageing and shrinking population. The industry’s overall premium income declined slightly in fiscal year 2024, interrupting the upward trend observed in the previous four years, primarily due to weaker sales of single-premium savings-type products, particularly foreign currency-denominated products.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Over the next 12 months, AM Best expects the current macroeconomic environment to support demand for asset-accumulation products, offering some degree of inflation protection,” said Chanyoung Lee, director, analytics, AM Best. “The life industry’s product mix is likely to shift further toward Japanese yen-denominated products as domestic interest rates remain elevated while foreign interest rates ease.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOther factors supporting the stable outlook include:\n\n</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nMajor Japan-based insurers have accelerated overseas expansion and diversified into adjacent domestic non-insurance market segments, reducing structural dependence on a contracting domestic insurance market and supporting medium-term earnings resilience.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nThe mandatory transition to the economic value-based solvency regime for all insurers by fiscal year ending 31 March 2026 is proceeding in an orderly manner, with the market capitalisation well above regulatory thresholds, underpinned by active asset-liability management and the strategic use of asset-intensive reinsurance.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nInsurers’ investments in agency digitalisation and new third-sector products are expected to support protection-type sales over the medium term.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nTo access the full copy of this commentary, please visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww3.ambest.com%2Fbestweek%2Fpurchase.asp%3Frecord_code%3D362794&amp;esheet=54434843&amp;newsitemid=20260226511082&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww3.ambest.com%2Fbestweek%2Fpurchase.asp%3Frecord_code%3D362794&amp;index=1&amp;md5=6798dad5174b62586cbf15da94ceb648\" tabindex=\"0\">http://www3.ambest.com/bestweek/purchase.asp?record_code=362794</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best is a global credit rating agency, news publisher and data analytics provider specialising in the insurance industry.

Excluding the non-controlling interests, equity attributable to shareholders was $293.3 million ($6.66 per share). This compares with total book value at the prior fiscal year end on May 31, 2025 of $617.8 million (as restated). Excluding the non-controlling interests, equity attributable to shareholders was $319.6 million ($7.26 per share) at May 31, 2025 (as restated).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Current assets, comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents, amounted to $46.4 million as of November 30, 2025, and $46.3 million as of May 31, 2025.

The equity security investment that accounts for the net loss is identified as Investment A in Note 4 of the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Investment Concentration.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For the six months ended November 30, 2025, FRMO's net loss attributable to the Company was $26.4 million ($0.60 per diluted share), compared to net income of $145.0 million ($3.29 per diluted share) a year earlier.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Net loss attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain or loss from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes for the three months ended November 30, 2025 was $7.3 million ($0.17 per diluted share) compared to net income of $46.1 million ($1.05 per diluted share) for the three months ended November 30, 2024 (as restated). The six-month figures, as of the same end dates, are a net loss of $8.6 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in 2025 compared to net income of $53.3 million ($1.21 per diluted share) in 2024 (as restated).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Net income or loss attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain or loss from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes is a measure not based on GAAP and is defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in \"Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\" at the end of this release.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Valuation of securities and digital assets are subject to change after November 30, 2025.

The Company owns 4.42% of HKHC and earns substantially all of its advisory fees from HKHC (see Note 4 - Investments, Investments under the Equity Method of Accounting). Due to the common control and ownership between HKHA and the Company's principal stockholders and directors, HKHA has been consolidated within the Company's financial statements. The noncontrolling interest of 78.23% and 78.12% in HKHA has been eliminated from results of operations for the periods ended November 30, 2025 and November 30, 2024.
