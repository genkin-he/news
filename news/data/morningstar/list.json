He urged APEC members to keep promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, deepen fiscal and financial cooperation, steadily push for regional economic integration, foster mutual alignment and collaborative progress, so as to inject impetus into the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Thirdly, Xi called on APEC members to work together to keep industrial and supply chains stable and smooth. APEC members should join hands rather than part ways, strengthen their links rather than sever them, vigorously expand common interests and support the open development of supply chains, strive for concrete and tangible results in physical, institutional and people-to-people connectivity, so as to further consolidate the foundations for open development in the Asia-Pacific region, Xi said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Fourthly, Xi called for advancing the digital and green transformation of trade. He urged efforts to make digital technologies a strong catalyst for cross-border trade, remove various green barriers, and expand cooperation in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Fifthly, Xi urged the Asia-Pacific to work together to promote universally beneficial and inclusive development.

As a steadfast advocate and active contributor to regional cooperation, China injects core momentum into the region's development through opening-up, pragmatic collaboration, and innovation-driven leadership.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Opening-up for global prosperity</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">President Xi said on Friday that walking with China means walking with opportunities, believing in China means believing in tomorrow, and investing in China means investing in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In a written speech delivered at the APEC CEO Summit, Xi said China can provide the global business community with more development opportunities, a sound business environment, a broad stage for innovation, and conditions for green growth.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Facts have proven that whoever has a firm foothold in the Chinese market will gain the upper hand in fierce international competition, he added.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The recommendations of the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) adopted by the recently concluded fourth plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee stressed that China will continue to expand opening-up at the institutional level, safeguard the multilateral trading system, and share opportunities with the rest of the world and promote common development.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"China's efforts to further open up and engage more with other countries is an encouraging signal,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore, told the Global Times on Friday.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In a volatile world, there is a need for regional economies to expand mutual trade among each other, Palit said. \"They can explore framework agreements for expanding bilateral and regional trade. They can also work with each other in building rules for new-generation trade issues such as managing supply chains, digital trade and sustainability.

More than 1.5 million people in Los Angeles County, most of them children and seniors, rely on CalFresh to put food on the table.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Earlier today, U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled from the bench following a similar decision by another federal judge, who declared the Trump administration's plan to halt SNAP benefits unlawful, but stopped short of ordering immediate payment.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">If benefits lapse, hundreds of thousands of families in Los Angeles County already struggling with hunger could face an even deeper crisis. The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank has already reported a 24% increase in demand this year alone.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">RIGHT NOW:</p>\n<ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A family is sleeping in their car because rent costs too much.</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A child is going to school hungry.</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A senior is choosing between medicine and food.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"This crisis is a stark reminder that we cannot rely solely on short-term fixes,\" said Santana. \"At CCF, we work with more than 2,000 partners—from the LA Regional Food Bank and YMCA to CIELO and dozens of grassroots organizations—to reach Angelenos who are too often left behind. For 110 years, CCF has stood with Los Angeles through wildfires, public health emergencies, and economic hardship. Together, we can ensure that families don't just survive these moments—but have the support to thrive long after.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"We learned from previous crises, including this year's wildfires and the COVID pandemic, that as we provide immediate aid, we hear from those affected how systems need to change – that could be insurance coverage or equitable health care.

The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity, the \"seven-year rule\" states that you should only invest money in the market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
