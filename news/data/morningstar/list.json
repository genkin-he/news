The outlook of the FSR is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGolden Tree is a subsidiary of Iris Financial Services Limited (IFS) and is owned ultimately by Springbrook Capital Ltd., a private holding company with diversified operations in insurance and financial services.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Credit Ratings (ratings) reflect Golden Tree’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe revised outlook to positive from stable of the Long-Term ICR reflects AM Best’s expectation that Golden Tree will be able to maintain improvements in its strongest balance sheet assessment driven by further growth in the United States, while sustaining its favorable trend in operating performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGolden Tree was established in 2015, as a segregated portfolio company. In 2019, the company was licensed as a Class 3A insurer under Bermuda laws to provide reinsurance capacity for commercial credit and credit life risks as part of the group’s retrocession cover, with geographic exposure mainly to Colombia’s insurance market, as well as a growing presence in the United States.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings also reflect Golden Tree’s sound operating performance, improving business profile and affiliation to Iris Financial Services, which provides synergies and operating efficiencies, as well as an appropriate ERM framework. Offsetting these positive rating factors are Golden Tree’s historic concentration in one business line and the strong competitive environment in its target geographic market of Colombia. Nevertheless, the company has expanded beyond its core market in other geographies with new specialty lines and by providing coverage to third parties.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGolden Tree’s balance sheet strength level of strongest is underpinned by a capital base reflecting consistent growth according to a 18.4% compound annual growth rate, in conjunction with its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Additionally, the company’s capital base has strengthened over time as a result of its sound underwriting practices. In 2024, the company sustained profitability mainly through underwriting, enabling it to generate a return-on-equity ratio of 24%. AM Best expects Golden Tree to maintain its important role in the group’s strategy. AM Best’s expectation comes amid healthy growth prospects and consistent profitability that is generated by business from the group´s proprietary managing general agent, which also has contributed to improve Golden Tree’s geographic footprint in the United States. Investment income, driven by a diversified strategy, has continued to support Golden Tree’s results further; however, the company is not dependent on this revenue to achieve positive bottom-line results.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFactors that could lead to positive rating actions for Golden Tree include an enhanced balance sheet strength driven by further growth in the United States and increased business diversification. Factors that could lead to negative rating actions include a material loss of capital, either from a substantial decline in profitability, due to new business volatility or execution risk, or an aggressive dividend policy, which reduces risk-adjusted capitalization to a level that no longer supports Golden Tree’s ratings.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

(Patria Re) (Mexico). AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” (Good) of Patria Re’s ultimate parent, Peña Verde, S.A.B. (Peña Verde) (Mexico). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Per AM Best’s criteria procedure on insurance holding companies, Peña Verde’s rating reflects a standard notching from Patria Re’s Long-Term ICR.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Patria Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe stable outlooks reflect Patria Re’s ability to maintain a stable and profitable operation along with a strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), while implementing its business expansion strategy.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re is Mexico's only locally registered reinsurer, founded in 1953. The company has a strong niche position in Mexico and in other Latin America markets, which allows it to accept profitable business selectively while maintaining a diversified product portfolio tailored to specific markets, where it has developed very strong client relationships. This strategy has resulted in consistently favorable underwriting results over the past few years.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re’s balance sheet strength assessment of strongest is supported by that same assessment on the company’s level of risk-adjusted capitalization, low underwriting leverage, a robust reinsurance program placed among counterparties with a strong security level and strong liquidity metrics. The ratings also reflect its comprehensive ERM infrastructure and expansive knowledge of its core markets in Latin America, which reflects the company’s smooth implementation of its expansion strategy with a stable overseas operation outside its niche market.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDespite limitations posted by catastrophe reserve development, Patria Re reported positive bottom-line results in 2024, mainly driven by favorable underwriting results. The company’s strong underwriting practices allowed Patria Re to report a bottom-line result of MXN 1 billion. The company’s efforts to maintain stable claims and management expenses have resulted in a profitable first six months for 2025, with a bottom-line of MXN 347 million, despite the limitations of catastrophe reserve development.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFactors that could lead to positive rating actions for the company include a consistent upward trend in profitability metrics that compare well with the strong operating performance, while maintaining its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as well as the continued and successful operation of its overseas expansion. Factors that may lead to negative rating actions include a sustained deterioration in risk-adjusted capitalization, driven either by unfavorable results or a significant cash withdrawal.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Typically, a stronger U.S. dollar makes U.S. grain exports less attractive for global customers versus the exports of other countries. Seemingly outweighing this uptick in the dollar is the desire of traders to get their books in order ahead of the weekend, said Brady Huck of Advance Trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Next Episode: The agricultural market is now looking past the U.S.-China deal and spent the day searching for the next major mover of futures. \"Grain action and volume slowed considerably overnight with the U.S.-China trade deal having come and gone,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases, although reports of cargoes did circulate today. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Going the Distance: Some analysts are unsure if soybean purchasing under the pending U.S.-China trade truce will take place as promised, even amid reports of Chinese buyers securing some new soybean cargoes. One reason is because there are no penalties described to enforce China's purchasing of 12 million metric tons of soybeans in this marketing year, along with 25 million tons of soybeans annually for the following three years. \"Whether China secures 25 MMTs in future years depends on the price relationships between South America and the U.S.\" AgResource said in a note. \"China buys what China needs at the cheapest price offered -- it's that simple.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dried Out: The U.S. Drought Monitor, which has remained in operation through the government shutdown, is showing dryness spread throughout the eastern Corn Belt states. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map, but also large areas of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest -- but the dryness likely hasn't helped those conditions. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Tyson Foods Co. will release its fourth quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
