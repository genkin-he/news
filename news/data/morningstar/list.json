She recounts the day her young son told her he wanted to die and the difficult path that followed. Drawing from her background in biomedical research, her family roots in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and her lived experience as a mother, Dr. Zeng explores how her family found a way forward without immediately relying on medication.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The talk focuses on practical, science-informed shifts that supported her son's mental well-being, including the role of food, time in nature, and intentional reflection. Dr. Zeng presents these approaches as complementary tools that can support children experiencing stress, anxiety, or depression, while emphasizing the importance of understanding root causes rather than only symptoms. Her message offers guidance not just for parents, but also for educators and caregivers seeking compassionate, grounded ways to support emotional health.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Dr. Zeng's work consistently connects personal experience with professional expertise. Born into generations of herbalists and trained as a medical researcher, she has dedicated her career to exploring how ancient healing traditions and modern science can work together to support both physical and mental health. Through her TEDx talk, she brings that philosophy into a broader conversation around parenting, resilience, and emotional care.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The talk has resonated strongly with viewers seeking alternatives and additional perspectives in conversations around children's mental health. By sharing her family's journey with honesty and clarity, Dr. Zeng aims to offer hope and practical insight to those navigating similar challenges.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The TEDx talk <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_a9EqVJcxw\" tabindex=\"0\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">How to Support Your Child's Mental Health Without Medication</em></a> is now available on YouTube.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Dr. Angela Zeng</strong><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Dr. Angela Zeng, PhD, MBA, is a scientist, entrepreneur, and the founder and CEO of Karviva Wellness Beverages.

Consumers should expect more 'silent pain' in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how it was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope rather than an electronic transfer - and I'm not sure I need or want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect any alleged money laundering; it does not mean that you have done anything wrong, as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong. In other words, there should be a paper trail if/when you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? That's \"structuring\" and it's illegal. This occurs if you deliberately break up financial transactions to avoid triggering mandatory reports required by law. Authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a fine-tooth comb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor and/or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of the death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax vs. estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As you note, only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source, and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent might the bank request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.

Despite record sales, investors blew hot and cold. U.S. equity futures--including the tech-heavy Nasdaq--slipped, with Nvidia up 1% premarket after falling earlier. Elsewhere, the AI narrative appeared in good shape as chip companies again drove South Korea's blue-chip Kospi index to new records. Earnings prints from Dell and CoreWeave will give further shape to the AI story Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Investors will focus on talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva. Oil prices nudged up ahead of the talks, holding above $70 a barrel, while investors bought into U.S. Treasurys. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --U.S. equity futures nudged down in early European trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% premarket, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq nudged down 0.1%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Nvidia reported record forth quarter sales and a 94% increase in profit, though traders were unconvinced by the chip maker's guidance. Salesforce failed to assuage investor concerns around the threat of AI agents to software stocks, with the stock falling 3.9% premarket. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Warner Bros. Discovery will also report earnings Thursday, with traders watching for any further updates on the battle between Netflix and Paramount to acquire the company. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Asian markets were mixed despite a lift from tech giant Nvidia's earnings overnight. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.3% to close at another new record, led by tech- and IT-related stocks. South Korea's Kospi ended 3.7% higher, rising for a sixth consecutive session as chip and auto stocks gained, and the central bank stood pat on rates, as widely expected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.8%, while the tech gauge dropped 2.1%, dragged by a range of companies from EV makers to chip stocks. The Shanghai Composite in China ended flat. India's Sensex edged 0.2% lower. Lithium prices rose, buoying some mining stocks in Australia and China following news that Zimbabwe banned the export of lithium-concentrate materials. Battery-makers fell as a result. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Europe's blue-chip indexes were mixed at market open as markets digest a barrage of earnings reports. The FTSE 100 was flat even as engines-maker Rolls-Royce climbed 5.7% after earnings, while London Stock Exchange Group gained 4.7% after announcing a buyback. Generic drugmaker Hikma Pharmaceuticals plummeted 15.5%, while miners also dragged on the sector. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The German DAX slipped 0.2% as healthcare stocks dragged, with Bayer down 2.1%. In Milan, gains for utilities companies counter losses for financials, holding the FTSE MIB flat. Utilities also weighed on the Spanish IBEX--down 0.3%--though software defense group Indra Sistemas jumped 11.5% after earnings. The French CAC 40 bucked the continental trend, rising 0.4% as energy group Engie jumped 6.8% after announcing a deal to buy a key U.K. electricity distributor. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The dollar edged lower, dented by tariff uncertainty and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer told the Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria program Wednesday that the tariff rate for some countries will rise to 15% or higher. Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday the rift between the Fed and Trump has started to erode trust in the central bank's independence. The DXY dollar index fell 0.1% to 97.637. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sterling fell as voters headed to the polls for a one-off U.K. local district election that could determine Prime Minister Keir Starmer's future. If the ruling Labour Party loses the seat, there are concerns that this could renew the threat of a leadership challenge for Starmer. Investors are concerned that if Starmer and Treasury chief Rachel Reeves were forced out, their replacements could favor increased fiscal spending and trigger fresh debt sustainability fears. Sterling fell 0.2% to $1.3528. The euro rose 0.2% to 0.8723 pounds. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --U.S. Treasury yields declined in Asian trade, reversing the previous day's rise. Hawkish remarks from Bank of Japan policy board member Hajime Takata--who said a rate hike is needed soon even as inflation risks mount in Japan--haven't affected U.S. Treasurys. Weekly jobless claims data are due later Thursday on a day otherwise light in U.S. data. The two-year Treasury yield fell 0.8 basis points to 3.462%, while the 10-year yield declined 0.6 basis points to 4.041%, according to Tradeweb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Yields on U.K. government bonds were steady as investors await the outcome of Thursday's special election. Ten-year gilt yields were little changed at 4.319%, Tradeweb data show. Eurozone government bond investors will focus on Italy's auction of up to 9 billion euros in 2031- and 2036-dated fixed-rate government bonds, or BTPs, and 2035-dated floating rate notes, or CCTeu, with results due shortly after 1000 GMT. Italy's auction will round off government bond sales in the eurozone for February. The 10-year German Bund yield was up 0.3 basis points at 2.711%. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Bitcoin fell as U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open after Nvidia's earnings. The drop in cryptocurrencies since October has come alongside a similar fall in tech stocks, Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar said in a note. \"We believe that the linkage between crypto and tech stocks will persist over the coming months.\" Bitcoin dropped 1.5% to $67,904 after reaching a one-week high of $69,847 Wednesday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Oil prices edged higher ahead of a third round of nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran later on Thursday. In early trade, Brent crude was up 0.3% to $70.94 a barrel, while WTI rose 0.3% to $65.35 a barrel. \"A constructive resolution would likely prompt the market to gradually unwind as much as a $10/bbl risk premium, which we believe is currently priced in,\" analysts at ING said. \"If talks break down, the upside risk remains, but the market may hold off on a full reaction until the scale of potential U.S. action against Iran becomes clearer.\" Meanwhile, the latest EIA data showed U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 16 million barrels last week, the largest weekly build since February 2023. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Gold prices slipped in early trading but remain above $5,100 a troy ounce as investors look ahead to U.S.-Iran talks later on Thursday. New York futures fell 0.7% to $5,191.60 an ounce, with gains tempered by concerns that U.S. interest rates could remain on hold for some time. Still, the metal is up more than 3.5% on the week, supported by renewed uncertainty around U.S. trade policy and geopolitical tensions with Iran. \"Any escalation in tensions involving Iran is likely to add further support and reinforce gold's role as a hedge against shocks,\" analysts at ING say. \"At the same time, the structural drivers behind gold's earlier rally remain firmly in place.\" </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 05:02 ET (10:02 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
