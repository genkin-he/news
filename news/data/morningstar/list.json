(Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     YouTube is feeling the downside of its increasing importance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As the streamer has seen its position grow, it has found itself engaged in a series of bruising fights over carriage fees with several major television companies - which has reached a pinnacle with a blackout of programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney's channels were removed from YouTube's pay-TV platform late Thursday after the media giant failed to reach an agreement with YouTube TV, which is owned by Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google, over payments for programming rights. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney's stock gained 0.3% in recent midday trading, while Alphabet shares pulled back 0.4% from the previous session's record close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Negotiations continue, but it's unclear when Disney's programming might resume. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's a modern twist on an old kind of fight. For years, channels would temporarily disappear from cable services amid fights over carriage fees, or what carriers pay television companies for the rights to show their programming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now it has migrated into streaming, with YouTube TV becoming a prime battleground. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     YouTube argues that Disney's move to pull its programming was aimed at steering viewers to its own streaming platforms, ESPN+, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube wrote in a note to its customers. Subscribers were offered a $20 credit if the Disney content was unavailable \"for an extended period of time.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney countered that the fault lies with YouTube TV for \"Refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fight with Disney is the latest in a string of disagreements between YouTube TV and several major television companies. The service, which is popular with viewers looking to watch live programming like sports and news, has previously fought with Fox Corp. (FOX), Comcast Corp.'s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Paramount Skydance Corp. (PSKY) over carriage fees, but had reached last-minute agreements with them before any disruption to programming could occur. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     (Fox Corp. and MarketWatch parent News Corp share common ownership.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A similar fight with TelevisaUnivision (MX:TLEVISACPO) reached an impasse last month, forcing the Spanish-language broadcaster's programming off YouTube TV's platform. That led President Donald Trump to press Google to make a deal and restore TelevisaUnivision's programming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     YouTube has become an increasingly dominant player in the streaming space. Its free platform commands the largest share of audience of any streamer. Its subscription service, which costs $82.99 for the base plan, has about 10 million subscribers and is expected to surpass most traditional pay-TV cable and satellite providers in the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Lukas I.

The milestone underscores growing sponsor demand for quality ocular endpoint protection delivered at the point of need, all backed by secure data workflows that streamline submissions and protect timelines.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAcross its portfolio, 20/20 Onsite has achieved a 95+ patient Net Promoter Score (NPS), 100% screening timelines met, and 85,000+ ophthalmic assessments conducted across 48 states. In verified studies, the company has maintained ~91% patient retention versus an industry Phase 3 average near 70%, helping sponsors reduce re-visits, protect endpoints, and keep programs on schedule.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“CNS and neurology trials can live or die by the consistency and integrity of their ocular endpoints,” said Ivan Quiroz, VP, Clinic Operations, 20/20 Onsite. “Sponsors trust us because we bring certified teams, validated equipment, and a patient-first workflow directly to the point of need—sites, homes, or community locations—so they get high-quality data without adding burden to patients or sites. Our job is to get it done, and get it done right, every time.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Purpose-Built to Protect Ocular Endpoints in Neuro Trials</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n20/20 Onsite’s model pairs field-based ophthalmic experts with validated imaging and exam equipment deployed via mobile vision clinics, mobile vision pods, and mobile clinic suites. This point-of-need approach reduces travel, improves consistency across timepoints, and increases access for underrepresented populations.

I understand that each child will get the equivalent of 50% of my Social Security payment until they are 18. By retiring when they are in the 10th grade my income will be low when they apply for college scholarships (which are set at income level two years before you apply). My big worry, however, is healthcare - not only for myself and my wife (who is a stay-at-home mother) but also for my kids. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens when they get sick and I'm on Social Security? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Older Father </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Father, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're in a tough spot. Actually, two tough spots and one OK spot. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, you are correct: Your children will likely be looked upon more favorably for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) given that, as you said, they will be assessed on the prior-prior rule (the prior two years before their start date). Second, your Medicare will not cover your spouse or twins. Third, your minor children will be entitled to the equivalent of 50% of your Social Security benefits, as you suggest, if you retire at 65 and decide to claim your benefits; they must be younger than 18 or 18-19 and a full-time student in high school (up to grade 12). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are alternatives for your wife and your kids: CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal and state program for children in low-income families who don't qualify for Medicaid, is one such option. Social Security is counted as part of the financial assessment process for both CHIP and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Plan. You can also apply for COBRA after retiring at 65; you will have 60 days from the date of the notice to sign up, and your children will be deemed qualified beneficiaries. COBRA can cost from $400 to $700 a month per person. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are conditions to qualify for COBRA. National Plan Administrators outlines them: \"You must have been enrolled in a health plan through your employer. But that's not all. The employer must have at least 20 employees, and you must experience a qualifying event that results in the loss of your health insurance. Whether you leave your job voluntarily or are laid off, you can opt for COBRA.\" (But not if you're fired for gross misconduct.) Other qualifiers: If your hours are cut and you lose your healthcare, if you get divorced and/or legally separated, or if a covered employee passes away. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have a tough decision ahead of you as an older father. Only you can decide whether your finances in retirement will be enough to cover the health, lifestyle and education needs of your children. Retiring when your twins are 15 will also restrict your ability to put money aside for a 529 college tax-advantaged savings plan. You're not the only one facing this particular dilemma. Insurance on the open market is, for the most part, more expensive than workplace-based insurance and ACA premiums can be more volatile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My colleague, reporter Beth Pinsker, has grappled with this exact question. \"Should you consider your children's healthcare-coverage needs in your retirement plan?\" she asked. \"Many people would say a knee-jerk 'hell no' to that question, even though the law now allows your children to stay on your health plan until they are 26. My kids will still be in their early 20s when I hit 60. For many parents of my generation, who had kids in their 40s, their kids will turn 26 after they turn 65 and start on Medicare. When I think about the timing of any decision to leave full-time work, it's somewhere in that window.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't envy your decision, but with the help of your wife, a financial adviser, and your intuition, I trust you will make the right one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate. Is that fair? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Luckily, I did not mix our finances': My husband is 7 years younger and has dementia.
