(3) SLK’s distinct Nanobody structure supposed increased tissue penetration would not translate to clinical efficacy; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired MoonLake common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">December 15, 2025 </strong>to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Contact Us To Participate or Learn More:</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact us:\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nCharles Linehan, Esq.,\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Glancy Prongay &amp;

And so far this year, Hershey said its chocolate retail sales have returned to growth, they have increased 4% after a previous 1% decline in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the stock dropped 2,7% in afternoon trading, toward its lowest prices seen since mid-July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     During the third quarter, Reese's Oreo was the \"top new item\" in the candy, mint and gum category, the company said, with retail-sales trends exceeding targets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Reese's Oreo </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Early data shows that Reese's Oreo overindexes with Gen Z and millennial buyers, a priority audience for the brand,\" Tanner said.

I've been taught my whole life to max out - to the extent that I'm able to - my 401(k) and a Roth IRA, slowly grow a \"rainy day\" savings account, and try to participate in the stock market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This amounts to a lot, and I'm fortunate to not have a ton of debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I learned recently that adhering to this guidance might be overly restrictive and prevent me from taking personal investment risks such as starting a project, investing in someone I know, or taking the time to pursue something more recreational. I feel a little caught between traditional guidance and more modern flexibility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Responsible Risk Taker </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're just starting out on your money or career journey and have questions about how to navigate your finances, we want to hear from you. Write to Dollar Signs, MarketWatch's new advice column, at dollarsigns@marketwatch.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Responsible, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Someone like you - young, financially disciplined - could absolutely stand to take some more risks. If you're saving for retirement, have an emergency fund and are participating in the stock market, putting money toward a hobby or a friend's passion project is totally reasonable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, you should know that if you give money to a friend to build a business or expand their side hustle, you will probably never see that money again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many people promise returns that are not guaranteed. I'm reminded of a person who wrote in to our Moneyist column a few years ago. They took $70,000 out of their 401(k) to invest in their friend's business and were told they'd be able to sell their shares for three times that amount. This was not the case. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I say that not to scare you, but to help manage your expectations about how these investments are likely to play out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Look at this spending as an investment in your happiness, not a way to build your wealth, said Kate Feeney, a CFP at Summit Place Financial Advisors in Summit, N.J. Some of her clients are spending money on hobbies like woodworking and glass blowing. But they are doing so as an investment in themselves, not as a way to generate financial returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whatever you choose to invest in, \"I think you have to do so because it's interesting and fulfilling to you, not because it's going to help you achieve financial goals,\" Feeney said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And never invest more than you can afford to lose. Feeney suggests putting less than 10% of your fun money toward personal projects: \"The amount should be something you're comfortable with going to zero,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Creating a budget can quell some of your risk-taking anxiety </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From this letter, I'm gleaning that reckless spending isn't in your nature - and I don't want my advice to cause some sort of overcorrection. You shouldn't be thoughtlessly throwing money at whatever excites you that day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And, to be clear, by age 30 you should (ideally) have the equivalent of one year's salary saved in a retirement account and an emergency fund that covers at least six months' worth of expenses. The average 401(k) savings for someone between ages 30 and 34 is $45,700, according to Fidelity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You should also aim to have a diversified portfolio. You can do this by investing in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track stock-market indexes like the S&amp;P 500 . If you want to take on a little more risk, you can invest in the Nasdaq 100 , which tracks tech companies and, traditionally, experiences more volatility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you check all those boxes and stay mindful of the caveats I mentioned, you don't need to stress about putting money toward more fun endeavors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, create a budget for these riskier moves so you don't end up overspending on them. Doing even a little bit of planning can also help alleviate some anxiety you might have about going against traditional investing advice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Anxiety stems from not having a plan and not feeling like you have everything lined up,\" said Nancy Listiawan, a CFP and founder of Veral Wealth in Pasadena, Calif. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Calculate how much you want to invest in a personal project each month and stick to that number. Then it won't feel like a loss as much as a planned expense. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ensuring that your future self has a strong financial safety net is wise, but it's not the only purpose of your income. Your money should also, hopefully, help you have a more fulfilling life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Money is a tool,\" Listiawan said. In other words, you can use it to travel, save for retirement, invest in the stock market and even help out a friend with a business idea - as long as you put any loan agreement in writing, and know you could lose all of your investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Running out of money in your 70s would be tragic, but so would being so restrictive that you don't enjoy your youth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Aditi Shrikant </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) are reporting their quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As MarketWatch reported Wednesday, a $5 trillion market cap is bigger than the 2024 gross domestic products of every country except the U.S. and China, and equals the International Monetary Fund projections for Germany's nominal GDP this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also Wednesday, Microsoft posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell, in addition to quarterly reports from Google's Alphabet and Facebook's Meta.

Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather.

It simply states that you should only invest money in the stock market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This rule will help you weather market downturns and the day-to-day news headlines that can negatively impact your investments,\" it said. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to your financial adviser, obviously, but consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
