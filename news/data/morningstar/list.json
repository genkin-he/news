He also urged efforts to promote universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and build an Asia-Pacific community. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Xi then put forward a five-point proposal.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">President Xi's remarks have drawn a positive response among domestic and foreign experts and enterprises, as they highly praise China's active contribution to regional cooperation and global prosperity through opening-up, pragmatic cooperation, and strong momentum in innovations.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Five-point proposal</strong> <br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Firstly, Xi called for joint efforts to safeguard the multilateral trading system. He urged APEC members to practice true multilateralism, enhance the authority and effectiveness of the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, and update international economic and trade rules to reflect the changing times, so as to better protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Secondly, Xi called for building an open economic environment in the region. He urged APEC members to keep promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, deepen fiscal and financial cooperation, steadily push for regional economic integration, foster mutual alignment and collaborative progress, so as to inject impetus into the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Thirdly, Xi called on APEC members to work together to keep industrial and supply chains stable and smooth. APEC members should join hands rather than part ways, strengthen their links rather than sever them, vigorously expand common interests and support the open development of supply chains, strive for concrete and tangible results in physical, institutional and people-to-people connectivity, so as to further consolidate the foundations for open development in the Asia-Pacific region, Xi said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Fourthly, Xi called for advancing the digital and green transformation of trade. He urged efforts to make digital technologies a strong catalyst for cross-border trade, remove various green barriers, and expand cooperation in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Fifthly, Xi urged the Asia-Pacific to work together to promote universally beneficial and inclusive development. Xi called for joint efforts to adhere to the people-centered development philosophy, focus on imbalances in development, and foster an economic globalization that is more inclusive, sustainable and beneficial to all peoples in the region.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Building Asia-Pacific community</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"With its roots deep in the Asia-Pacific, China is always committed to the region's stability and prosperity. President Xi's five-point proposal, building on a series of China's initiatives to advance Asia-Pacific development, once again contributes China's solutions to win-win cooperation in the region,\" Liu Xiaoxue, an associate research fellow at the National Institute of International Strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Today, the Asia-Pacific region, home to one-third of the world's population, accounts for over 60 percent of the global economy and nearly half of world trade.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Over the past 30-plus years since its founding, APEC has been spearheading the region's rise to the forefront of global open development, and has made the Asia-Pacific the most dynamic part of the global economy, Xi noted.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Currently, changes unseen in a century are accelerating across the world, and the Asia-Pacific faces growing uncertainties and destabilizing factors in its development, he said, adding that the rougher the seas, the more APEC members must pull together.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"President Xi's speech charts a clear direction for the Asia-Pacific region amid evolving global challenges,\" Han Bicheng, founder and CEO of neurotechnology firm BrainCo, told the Global Times on Friday on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Gyeongju.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The five-point proposal systematically addresses core regional challenges, particularly in safeguarding the multilateral trading system and deepening regional economic integration, demonstrating China's responsibility as a major country in advancing regional peace and sharing prosperity while providing confidence and a path forward for economies worldwide to jointly tackle global uncertainties, Han said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Hemione Hudson, Chair and CEO of PwC China, told the Global Times on Friday on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Gyeongju that \"The Asia-Pacific region is a vital engine for global growth.

They can also work with each other in building rules for new-generation trade issues such as managing supply chains, digital trade and sustainability. These efforts, along with those to shore up the rules-based trade order of the WTO, should contribute significantly to stabilizing global trade,\" he said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In the first three quarters this year, China's total goods imports and exports in yuan-denominated terms rose to 33.61 trillion yuan ($4.73 trillion), hitting a new high. In particular, the country's foreign trade in the third quarter grew by 6 percent year-on-year, maintaining growth for the eight straight quarter, official data showed on October 13.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Having operated in China for decades, PwC has witnessed China's sustained efforts in promoting trade, investment liberalization and facilitation. We look forward to China hosting APEC next year and working closely with all Asia-Pacific partners to build a sustainable future for the region,\" Hudson said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">President Xi's speech has provided fundamental guidance for the China Council for Promotion of International Trade to do a good job in boosting APEC business community cooperation in 2026, Sun Xiao, secretary general of China Chamber of International Commerce, told the Global Times on Friday on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Gyeongju.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Moving forward, we will follow the President's important instruction, and take concrete steps to foster an open and inclusive Asia-Pacific economic landscape, contributing greater momentum to global economic growth,\" Sun said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN13071&amp;sd=2025-10-31\"/></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-xi-puts-forward-five-point-proposal-for-building-asia-pacific-community-at-apec-302601539.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-xi-puts-forward-five-point-proposal-for-building-asia-pacific-community-at-apec-302601539.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Global Times</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

More than 1.5 million people in Los Angeles County, most of them children and seniors, rely on CalFresh to put food on the table.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Earlier today, U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled from the bench following a similar decision by another federal judge, who declared the Trump administration's plan to halt SNAP benefits unlawful, but stopped short of ordering immediate payment.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">If benefits lapse, hundreds of thousands of families in Los Angeles County already struggling with hunger could face an even deeper crisis. The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank has already reported a 24% increase in demand this year alone.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">RIGHT NOW:</p>\n<ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A family is sleeping in their car because rent costs too much.</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A child is going to school hungry.</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A senior is choosing between medicine and food.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"This crisis is a stark reminder that we cannot rely solely on short-term fixes,\" said Santana. \"At CCF, we work with more than 2,000 partners—from the LA Regional Food Bank and YMCA to CIELO and dozens of grassroots organizations—to reach Angelenos who are too often left behind. For 110 years, CCF has stood with Los Angeles through wildfires, public health emergencies, and economic hardship. Together, we can ensure that families don't just survive these moments—but have the support to thrive long after.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"We learned from previous crises, including this year's wildfires and the COVID pandemic, that as we provide immediate aid, we hear from those affected how systems need to change – that could be insurance coverage or equitable health care. Emergencies can expose disparities that have long been overlooked. They show us that any one of us can suddenly become vulnerable.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This month, CCF created the Impact Fund to respond rapidly to crises like this one while also investing in long-term solutions that address the root causes of hunger, housing insecurity, and healthcare gaps, Santana said.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The support helps in two ways:</p>\n<ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">Today: Families receive emergency food, shelter, and resources.</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">Tomorrow: Communities gain advocacy, organizing, and policy support to create real, lasting change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">CCF funds partners who reach immigrants afraid to ask for help, seniors skipping meals, and working families one paycheck from hunger.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"When a child goes hungry, we respond today.

With IRA withdrawals and Social Security, this man is enjoying some well-earned gravy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors should not make decisions about their portfolio based on a feared downturn in the S&amp;P 500 SPX.

Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity, the \"seven-year rule\" states that you should only invest money in the market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

In June 2022, my childhood home in New Jersey was sold and I was due to receive 20% of my father's 50% stake in the home. My mother retained the other 50% as part of her residuary trust, which excluded me as a beneficiary. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The attorney for my late father stated that all beneficiaries needed to wait 10 months before disbursements from the sale of the home could be released. I was told that if no unknown creditors came forward during that timeframe, that my 20% share would be released to me. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As my father had no unknown creditors or debts, the attorney sent two separate letters stating that the executor of my father's will (my sister) wanted to expedite my disbursement and asked me to sign a release so that my portion from the sale of the home could be sent to me. After two weeks, I received a check. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'The newly appointed attorney has demanded that I return almost half of the amount that I received and has filed a civil action to compel me to do so.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fast forward two-and-a-half years: The executor (my sister) fired the original attorney, hired a new one, spent over $75,000 in legal fees, isn't speaking to any of the beneficiaries, and failed to finalize the terms of my late father's will, which included the transfer of three other properties designated to my siblings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I am not a beneficiary of the other properties; I was only entitled to a portion from the sale of my childhood home. Still, the executor has failed to finalize my father's wishes and has exhausted estate resources, which include tapping into the proceeds from the sale of my childhood home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The newly appointed attorney has demanded that I return almost half of the amount that I received and has filed a civil action to compel me to do so. Given that no new creditors have come forward and that I am not a beneficiary of the other properties that caused the delay in finalizing the estate, am I required to return any of the proceeds? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Why I Left N.J. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My daughter has $500K in med-school expenses.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You are not responsible for the executor's mismanagement of your father's estate or the legal fees incurred by your sister's increasingly litigious behavior. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Why, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So much about the handling of your father's estate stinks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Firstly, there is a statute of limitations on contesting a will in New Jersey, which has long been far exceeded by the shenanigans with your father's estate. Secondly, the executor of your father's estate was either asleep on the job and/or had an inexplicable volte-face. Thirdly, it's not up to you to return the money; it's up to the executor's attorney to compel you under the law to return the money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is a vortex of chaos, and the executor and her lawyer want to suck you in. You are responsible for claiming your inheritance and for signing the release of these funds, and waiting the required amount of time under the law in your state. You are not responsible for the executor's mismanagement of your father's estate and you are not responsible for the legal fees incurred by your sister's increasingly litigious behavior. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your father's attorney was broadly correct. In New Jersey, nine months is the standard waiting period for creditors to file claims against an estate, starting from the date of the decedent's death. Therefore, executors should wait at least this length of time before distributing any assets to beneficiaries to avoid personal liability. Oftentimes, estate attorneys will wait one year to account for paperwork and due process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is a vortex of chaos, and the executor and her lawyer want to suck you in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About that pesky statute of limitations: \"In New Jersey, once notice of probate is given by the proponent of a will, interested parties or next of kin typically have 120 days to contest a will,\" says Scura, Wigfield, Heyer, Stevens &amp; Cammarota, a law firm which has several offices in the state. \"This period allows interested parties to file objections to the will's validity. You must act promptly within this timeframe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Missing the deadline will prevent a challenge to the will's validity unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying an extension, which would typically involve proving fraud, misconduct or incapacity during the probate process,\" the law firm adds. \"If you are an out-of-state resident with an interest in a will or potential interest, New Jersey law provides a longer period of 180 days from the notice of probate to contest a will.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From what you say, your father's attorney did his due diligence and followed the letter of the law. The subsequent actions by your sister, the executor, make very little sense. Assuming you have the full story and/or did not hold anything back, this entire sorry saga strikes me as both unprofessional and unprecedented - assuming this case does not get thrown out of probate court by the judge. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The executor's actions are bad manners, at best, or a willful abandoning of her fiduciary duty, at worst. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An executor trying to claw back prior disbursements? That's bad manners, at best, or a willful abandoning of her fiduciary duty, at worst. Your lawyer is the best person to advise you going forward, but I would not be surprised if they suggest that you file a petition with the probate court to remove your sister as executor for misconduct, endangering the estate's assets, mismanagement or all of the above. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You don't have to prove intentional misconduct. \"Beneficiaries of an estate can ask to remove a personal representative when they have demonstrated that they cannot competently manage estate affairs,\" according to the Martin Law Office LLC. \"Particularly in scenarios where the estate contains high-value assets or a substantial amount of money, the proper management of those assets is important. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Improper choices when maintaining, investing or liquidating resources can be a reason to request the removal of a representative from their role,\" the law firm adds. \"If they have cost the estate money or have attempted to conduct transactions that would diminish the value of the estate, the courts may agree that their removal is in the best interests of the beneficiaries.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's time to clip the executor's wings, permanently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'My family is having a crisis': My mom added my brother to her mortgage.
