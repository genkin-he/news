During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, <span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">China's</span> exports of wind and photovoltaic products have helped other countries reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 4.1 billion tons, making a significant contribution to the global low-carbon transition.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For example, in <span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Bosnia and Herzegovina</span>, the Ivovik Wind Power Project, which was jointly developed by PowerChina and China General Technology Group, with a capacity of 84 megawatts, marks the country's largest wind farm and is projected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 240,000 tons annually, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Another good example is the \"Rural Solar\" off-grid project developed by Chinese technology giant Huawei in <span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Cameroon</span>.

As the globally recognized “Queen of Christmas,” Carey’s beloved 1994 yuletide hit “All I Want For Christmas Is You” has become one of the longest-charting singles in any genre, spending 65 weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100. In 2015, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 2023, Carey became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award for surpassing one billion streams in the United Kingdom.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nMost recently, Mariah dropped two new singles for her upcoming 16th studio album Here For It All, her first in seven years to be released on September 26.

In 2009, Carey was recognized with the Breakthrough Performance Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival for her critically acclaimed role in Lee Daniels’ “Precious.” Carey went on to appear in Daniels’ ensemble piece “The Butler” in 2013. A Congressional Award recipient, Carey has generously donated her time and energy to a range of philanthropic causes near to her heart, including Save the Music, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, World Hunger Relief, and the Elton John AIDS Foundation, among many others.
