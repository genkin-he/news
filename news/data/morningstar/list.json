            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Strategist says expect equities to take a hit and crude and gold to gain </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A plume of smoke rises following a reported explosion in Tehran on Feb. 28, 2026. Two loud blasts were heard in Tehran on Feb. 28 morning by AFP journalists, and two plumes of thick smoke were seen over the center and east of the Iranian capital. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors roiled for weeks by AI disruption and then hotter-than-expected inflation on Friday faced a fresh level of stress after the U.S. and Israel launched attacks on Iran to destabilize its nuclear ambitions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,\" President Donald Trump said in a video message published on his Truth Social account early Saturday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse of how investors might react, as they wait for Asian markets to open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) slid 3.1% to $63,561, a level not seen since early February. Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes could be nearing, with Trump suggesting to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"At this stage there are many unknowns, and the situation is incredibly fast moving. The damage done by U.S.-Israeli strikes, and the targets of those strikes, is not yet clear; nor is the impact of any Iranian retaliatory action,\" said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, in a note to clients. \"In addition, the precise scope of the action, nor mission aims, are obvious at this stage. Furthermore, it is not known whether any crude infrastructure has been targeted, or impacted, at the present time.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apart from surging oil prices on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP  and Dow industrials DJIA tumbled after a surprise spike in producer prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brown said investors could see a \"relatively predictable\" reaction to the strikes on Iran, starting with a big leap in crude prices. Also likely to get bid are haven assets, such as gold (GC00), which jumped nearly 11% in February, finishing at $5,230.50 an ounce on Friday. That marked gold's biggest one-month percentage gain since January 2012, and its monthly gain of $516.60 was the biggest one-month net gain on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brown said the Japanese yen (USDJPY), Swiss franc (USDCHF) and U.S. Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD30Ywould also likely be in the outperformer category. Investors have been increasingly pushing into U.S. government debt recently, a move strategists have attributed to fears over AI threats to employment and economic growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While equities will likely \"face headwinds,\" Brown said investors should remember that \"geopolitical events tend not to be a trigger for durable or longer-lasting market moves in any asset. Of course, there's a risk that this time could be different, however it is unlikely to be the case once participants have discounted the initial shock triggered by this weekend's events.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump last week offered a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, which left this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike. Iran has been one of the world's biggest oil producers, controlling to several crucial \"chokepoints,\" such as the Strait of Hormuz. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In his social-media post, Trump did not indicate how long the strikes would last. The Associated Press reported a daylight Saturday attack on Tehran, with initial blasts hitting near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He said after the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, Iran was warned never to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the U.S. \"sought repeatedly to make a deal.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions and we can't take it anymore. Instead they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe and could soon reach the American homeland,\" Trump said in his address. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,\" he said, recounting \"an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder\" against the U.S. over 47 years, as well as attacks on Israel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We're going to annihilate their navy, we're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Addressing the people of Iran - thousands of protesters were killed during protests at the start of the year - Trump also said the U.S. was giving them their \"only chance for generations\" to rise up against their government. He advised citizens in Iran to stay sheltered as \"bombs will be dropping everywhere,\" but after that they would have that opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now is the time to seize control of your destiny,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Myra P.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A massive backlog of maintenance and software contracts will ensure recurring revenue </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 4001 stealth fighter is silhouetted against the setting sun in this undated file photo. Saturday's strikes on Iran by the U.S. and Israel will likely shine an even bigger spotlight on defense stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defense stocks have been treated as geopolitical barometer. When tensions rise and military conflict breaks out, shares climb. When headlines cool, the trade fades. It's a narrative built around procurement cycles and crisis-driven spending. The attack on Tehran on Saturday by Israel and the U.S. should repeat this pattern for defense stocks in coming days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But something more structural and long-term has been unfolding, something that looks far less like a one-off weapons sale and more like a long-term service contract. Parts of the defense industry are beginning to resemble subscription businesses, recurring revenue layered on top of a growing installed base. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For investors focused on earnings durability rather than war headlines, that distinction matters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weapons systems have evolved from disposable purchases to multi-decade ecosystems nowadays. Once a country fields a fleet of fighter jets, missile defense batteries, or naval destroyers, it commits to years or even decades of operating and support costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly noted that operating and support costs can account for roughly 70% of a major weapon system's total life-cycle cost, according to recent GAO report. Upkeep includes spare parts, depot maintenance, training, software updates, systems integration and availability guarantees. Since national defense cannot tolerate downtime, readiness spending tends to persist even when procurement ebbs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In practical terms, the contractor that builds the platform often remains embedded in its upkeep. Every additional aircraft delivered expands the pool of long-term maintenance, logistics and modernization revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That dynamic increasingly resembles aerospace aftermarket economy (and, in some respects, enterprise software) where installed bases drive recurring cash flow. Three companies that stand to benefit: Lockheed Martin (LMT); RTX (RTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lockheed Martin: The ecosystem model: Lockheed Martin provides the clearest example of this shift. The F-35 program represented 26% of consolidated net sales in 2024, according to the company's latest Form 10-K. The filing explicitly states that F-35 revenue includes development, production, and maintenance, underscoring how support and logistics are embedded in the program's economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Service sales increased in 2024, driven in part by higher volume on F-35 upkeep contracts, the company disclosed in that same annual report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the end of 2025, Lockheed Martin reported a record $194 billion backlog and strong free cash flow generation in its full-year earnings release. That backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility that many industrial companies lack. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Support performance is not immune from scrutiny; a Pentagon watchdog has recently criticized aspects of F-35 maintenance and aircraft availability. Recurring revenue in defense is contractual and performance-based, not automatic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even so, the installed-base effect is unmistakable: every aircraft delivered expands a long-term revenue stream tied to readiness and modernization. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     RTX: Installed base, diversified: RTX offers a different version of installed-base economy. The company has recently reported strong sales growth and highlighted a backlog approaching $268 billion, according to its latest earnings results. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the defense side, missile systems and air defense platforms require ongoing upgrades and upkeep. Collins Aerospace operates within a vast installed base of aircraft systems that generate recurring parts and maintenance demand, the approach the company emphasizes in its investor materials. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Commercial aftermarket revenue behaves in many ways like an annuity tied to flight hours, while defense modernization cycles add a second layer of durability. The combination smooths earnings compared to pure production-driven models. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Northrop Grumman and the long arc of modernization: Northrop Grumman's portfolio is heavily weighted toward advanced systems - stealth aircraft, space assets, sensors and mission technologies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Once fielded, those systems demand continuous upgrades and integration work as modern defense doctrine emphasizes ongoing modernization rather than static platforms. Sensors are refreshed. Software evolves. Networks expand. The company ended 2025 with backlog nearing $95.7 billion, according to its most recent annual report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Northrop's strength in high-end systems integration positions it to benefit from that long modernization arc, although development-heavy programs can introduce project timing volatility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The software layer: Defense as ongoing service: The transformation is perhaps the most visible in defense's growing digital footprint. The U.S. Defense Department's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract vehicle reflects a shift toward acquiring commercial cloud services across classification levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Software-native companies like Palantir Technologies (PLTR) operate directly in that layer, providing analytics and AI systems through multi-year government contracts. Recent analyst coverage has highlighted the company's expanding government engagements and recurring revenue profile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While valuation and volatility differ from traditional primes, the software layer most closely resembles true subscription economy within defense budgets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market may be behind the curve </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite these structural shifts, defense contractors are often valued like cyclical industrial companies. The implicit assumption is that earnings are driven primarily by procurement wins and geopolitical events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If maintenance, modernization and software continue rising as a share of revenue, that assumption will grow increasingly incomplete. Recurring support contracts and installed-base monetization can dampen earnings swings and support steadier free cash flow. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, intellectual property and data rights in maintenance contracts is a critical issue that the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined in its recent review of IP and sustainment planning. Control over technical data can shape who captures margin over the life of a program. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Markets tend to reward predictability. Businesses with durable cash flows often command stronger valuation multiples than those dependent on episodic demand. If defense contractors continue migrating toward service-heavy revenue mixes, the sector's risk profile may increasingly resemble infrastructure rather than crisis trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defense stocks will continue to react to geopolitical headlines, but beneath those swings lies a structural evolution in how revenue is generated and sustained. The companies that control large, technologically complex installed bases -aircraft fleets, missile systems, naval platforms, secure networks - are not merely selling equipment. They are managing ecosystems that require continuous funding to remain operational. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This shift reframes the opportunity. Defense may no longer be just a trade on conflict. Increasingly, it resembles a long-duration cash-flow business anchored in readiness, modernization and software-driven support. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market may still be pricing yesterday's model. Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Trump says 'massive' strike against Iran underway - bitcoin plunge offers a glimpse of how markets could react </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to destroy their missiles,' says Trump </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A plume of smoke rises following a reported explosion in Tehran on Feb. 28, 2026. Two loud blasts were heard in Tehran on Feb. 28 morning by AFP journalists, and two plumes of thick smoke were seen over the center and east of the Iranian capital. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors roiled for weeks by AI disruption and then hotter-than-expected inflation on Friday faced a fresh level of stress after the U.S. and Israel launched attacks on Iran to destabilize its nuclear ambitions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,\" President Donald Trump said in a video message published on his Truth Social account early Saturday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse of how investors might react, until Asian markets open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) slid 3.1% to $63,561, a level not seen since early February. Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes could be nearing, with Trump suggesting to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. The S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP  and Dow industrials DJIA tumbled on Friday after a surprise spike in producer prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump last week offered a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, which left this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike. Iran has been one of the world's biggest oil producers, controlling to several crucial \"chokepoints,\" such as the Strait of Hormuz. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In his social-media post, Trump did not indicate how long the strikes would last. The Associated Press reported a daylight Saturday attack on Tehran, with initial blasts hitting near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump said in his post that after the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, Iran was warned never to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the U.S. \"sought repeatedly to make a deal.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions and we can't take it anymore. Instead they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe and could soon reach the American homeland,\" Trump said in his address. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,\" he said, recounting \"an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder\" against the U.S. over 47 years, as well as attacks on Israel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We're going to annihilate their navy, we're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Addressing the people of Iran - thousands of protesters were killed during protests at the start of the year - Trump also said the U.S. was giving them their \"only chance for generations\" to rise up against their government. He advised citizens in Iran to stay sheltered as \"bombs will be dropping everywhere,\" but after that they would have that opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now is the time to seize control of your destiny,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Myra P.

Recalling a time when \"China was still catching up with the rest of the world,\" Khan said he is struck by the \"consistency of effort\" seen today. \"People work hard and they also cherish family, tradition and festivals,\" he said. \"There's a balance between ambition and humanity.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For Khan, China is a living model where \"science serves society, innovation lifts communities, and progress is measured not just in patents or GDP, but in human dignity.\" \"That's the beauty of China,\" he remarked.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Foreign experts framed their expectations for the upcoming Two Sessions within this broader context of balanced and human-centric development.
