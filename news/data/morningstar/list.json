L3Harris is investing billions of dollars into modernizing and expanding its sites across the nation to significantly increase solid rocket motor production, including for Munitions Acceleration Council programs.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Thank you for being the backbone of our department and our great nation, for having the backs of our warfighters because what you build right here in Camden is absolutely central to the 21st Century Arsenal of Freedom,” Secretary Hegseth said. “You are the patriots ensuring that our warriors are never, ever in a fair fight. The more than 115,000 solid rocket motors that you’re building every single year can’t be matched.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Industrial capacity has become a strategic element of deterrence; the ability to deliver at scale, with speed and reliability, directly impacts how effectively the United States can deter threats and project peace through strength,” said Christopher Kubasik, Chairman and CEO, L3Harris. “Thank you, Secretary Hegseth, for reinforcing to our Camden team that what L3Harris builds here directly contributes to the safety of our warfighters and our homeland.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDuring the visit, Secretary Hegseth engaged employees who produce the propulsion systems that power the PAC-3 air and missile defense system and met with the teams who manufacture the large solid rocket motors for strategic deterrence, interceptors, hypersonic systems and target missiles. He also reviewed construction progress on the company’s new Arkansas Advanced Propulsion Facilities (AAPF).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe AAPF facilities are an expansive new campus that will support medium and large solid rocket motor production. The 110-acre campus will include more than 20 new buildings and increase large solid rocket motor manufacturing capacity sixfold. The expansion incorporates advanced manufacturing technologies, automation and digital process controls L3Harris designed to improve safety, efficiency and throughput while providing long-term, domestic surge capacity.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Camden site produces thousands of solid rocket motors a year that support a wide range of Department of War programs. L3Harris is investing billions in this competitive market to deliver at the scale and speed the Department of War demands. The company’s 2,000-acre Camden site is one of the nation’s largest solid rocket motor manufacturing centers and has supported national and allied defense missions for more than four decades.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nL3Harris acquired the solid rocket motor business in 2023 and has transformed and grown its production operations to align with the Department of War’s increasing demand for missile programs. L3Harris intends to pursue an initial public offering of the solid rocket motor business in the second half of the year.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About L3Harris Technologies</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nL3Harris is the Trusted Disruptor in defense tech.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Joseph Adinolfi, Joy Wiltermuth and Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A plethora of issues pushed U.S. stocks lower in the final trading session of a rough month </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 stumbled amid a turbulent February for stocks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks were caught up Friday in a whirlwind of market-moving headlines, making for a wild final trading day in a rough month for U.S. equities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The penultimate day of February saw President Trump signal that the U.S. military remains ready to strike Iran. There also were more problems on the inflation and private-credit fronts, with shares of financial stocks - banks and asset managers alike - selling off hard. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors largely blamed the collapse of U.K.-based mortgage lender Market Financial Solutions for reviving fears about more \"cockroaches\" to come in the private-credit industry. But there was also an announcement from Apollo Global Management (APO) that it had reduced a dividend at a private-credit fund and re-evaluated some asset values due to challenges with its loan portfolio. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index BKX fell nearly 5% to cap off the month. Shares of Blue Owl Capital (OWL) fell nearly 6%, while Apollo's stock was down more than 8%, FactSet data showed. Blue Owl spooked investors earlier in February when it limited investor withdrawals and sold $1.4 billion in private-credit assets, including some software loans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other issues for investors arrived ahead of the opening bell, including a troubling inflation report that showed wholesale prices rose by 0.5% in January - faster than the 0.3% increase economists had expected. Meanwhile, what some have called the artificial-intelligence \"fear trade\" remained in full effect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Investors are readjusting their risk budget right now in a risk-off mood on Friday, and that the AI momentum is now becoming AI anxiety,\" said Brian Mulberry, chief market strategist at Zacks Investment Management. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A 'shoot first, ask questions later' market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Software stocks and megacap technology players like Nvidia (NVDA) continued to struggle on Friday, adding to their already punishing losses over the past month. This time, semiconductor stocks - particularly highflying memory names like Sandisk (SNDK) and Micron Technology (MU), which have soared recently while software has plunged - joined in the selling as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks trading outside of the U.S. mostly continued to trundle higher in February, with big gains particularly in the South Korean market. But in the U.S., a dour mood has been underscored by a couple of apparent contradictions, as Jay Hatfield, a portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, pointed out during a conversation with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, sentiment in certain corners of the market has soured dramatically, even though the S&amp;P 500 SPX finished Friday roughly 2 percentage points shy of record territory. Second, there are seemingly contradictory narratives causing havoc within the technology sector, the largest and most important sector for the U.S. equity market's overall stability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Megacap tech stocks are struggling as investors balk at the massive spending on AI infrastructure, seemingly worried about the possibility that the return on investment might be too weak to justify the tremendous cost. Recent earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) elicited negative reactions from investors, while even blockbuster earnings from Nvidia earlier this week weren't enough to turn the tide. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, fears that AI might be so successful it turns whole industries on their heads have hammered shares of software companies, asset managers, commercial real-estate and brokerage firms, cybersecurity companies, and even transportation and logistics firms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"These ideas don't even make sense internally - but they're all out there, and all of these companies are going down,\" Hatfield told MarketWatch Friday. \"This is a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of market.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A Substack post penned by Citrini Research that went viral Monday was widely credited with inspiring the worst selloff in stocks in three weeks. The report envisioned an economy in 2028 where AI is successful enough to cause widespread white-collar job destruction, without new industries emerging to absorb displaced workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"AI has been disrupting a different segment of the economy on a daily basis,\" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at Citizens Wealth, in a phone interview Friday. He noted that \"the narrative has been shifting\" away from talk of huge productivity gains from AI to worries over potential job losses and damage to the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A puzzling bid for bonds </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There also has been a sudden bid for bonds. Instead of Treasury yields rising on signs that inflation might be rearing back up, the benchmark 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipped below the 4% threshold on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation can be kryptonite for bonds. But lately, inflation and the timing of any future Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts have taken a backseat to investors seeking safety from the selloff in software names, said Sweta Singh, a portfolio manager at City Different Investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's the legacy [software-as-a-service] scared money that is being parked into the Treasury market,\" Singh told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This dynamic has also helped bonds shrug off the Supreme Court's decision to rule most of President Trump's tariffs illegal, Singh noted. The ruling raised new questions about the size of U.S. fiscal deficits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In other haven plays, the U.S. dollar DXY failed to gain ground Friday against a basket of rival currencies, despite Trump saying he would \"love not to\" attack Iran. Yet gold (GC00,) which global central banks have been stockpiling as a dollar alternative, has been playing second fiddle to silver (SI00) as investors grow more nervous about a splintering world order. Both metals saw their largest monthly gains on record in February, Dow Jones Market Data showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A \"panic\" rotation has also helped boost shares of defensive stocks in the consumer-staples sector. Investors trawling for value stocks have also boosted shares of energy and materials names. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: February's 'panic' rotation in stocks sets the stage for more tumult in March </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP finished in the red on Friday, and both indexes capped off their worst monthly drop since March 2025, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now fallen during three of the past four months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet it wasn't all bad news. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA managed to eke out a gain for the month - taking its winning streak to 10 months, its longest such run since January 2018. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Joseph Adinolfi -Joy Wiltermuth -Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(\"Algo Grande\") (TSXV:ALGR)(OTC:KNDYF)(FRA:KM00) announces the closing of its previously announced non-brokered private placement and the election of three new directors at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Pursuant to its news releases dated February 11, 2026 and February 19, 2026, the Company has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\"), at a deemed price of $0.65 per Share. The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,524,063.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's 100%-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of $169,605.44, being equal to 7% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to 7% of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of $0.65 per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of $50,000 (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of $0.65 per Share.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Raymond Jannas</p></li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Hunter Scharfe</p></li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Enrico Gay</p></li></ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $50,150.75 in the Offering.

The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than 25% of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States.

As conversations around consent and sexual wellness continue to evolve, Dr. Laino emphasizes that condoms are not just about prevention - they help create a shared understanding of responsibility, reduce anxiety around unintended consequences, and allow couples to be more present with one another.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Being responsible and using condoms should feel seamless, not awkward,” says Dr. Laino. “When you feel confident and comfortable, you can focus on the chemistry, the closeness, and the experience you’re creating together - which is what truly enhances pleasure and connection.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWhen used correctly and consistently, condoms remain one of the most effective and accessible methods for helping prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. But beyond protection, they can also increase emotional safety, build mutual trust, and remove distractions or worry that can interfere with intimacy - ultimately allowing partners to feel more relaxed, confident, and connected in the moment.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAmong one of the newest sexual health innovations is <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trojanbrands.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fcondoms%2Ftrojan-goat-non-latex-lubricated-condoms&amp;esheet=54435690&amp;newsitemid=20260227512574&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Trojan+G.O.A.T.%26%238482%3B+%28Greatest+of+All+Trojan%29&amp;index=1&amp;md5=381cf76f158d740af1f7cf2b11a378fe\" tabindex=\"0\">Trojan G.O.A.T.™ (Greatest of All Trojan)</a> from Trojan Brand Condoms.

He added that the Department of Defense and other U.S. agencies have six months to phase out Anthropic's technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. On Thursday, Anthropic said it would work to enable a \"smooth transition\" to another provider. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's announcement comes after days of public and private back-and-forth negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic that occasionally turned ugly. After Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei defended his company's refusal to budge on Thursday, a Pentagon official accused him of trying to \"personally control the U.S. military.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, wrote on X. Michael, a former executive at Uber Technologies (UBER), also accused Anthropic of having a plan to \"impose\" its values on Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conflict stems from Anthropic's contract with the Defense Department, which is worth up to $200 million. Anthropic has drawn a line in the sand over how the agency can use its technology. Specifically, Anthropic doesn't want its products to be used to develop autonomous weapons or for mass surveillance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon has said it has \"no interest\" in using AI for those purposes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,\" Amodei wrote Thursday. \"Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today's technology can safely and reliably do.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But that didn't square with a Jan. 9 memo handed down by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that calls for AI labs to amend their defense contracts to allow \"any lawful use\" of their technology. Hegseth gave the department 180 days to insert that standard into any contract that involves procuring AI services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"DoD does not want a private company's usage policy to function as a veto over lawful military applications,\" Jessica Tillipman, a professor at George Washington University's law school who specializes in government procurement law, told MarketWatch over email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If DoD makes this the default clause across all AI vendors, it eliminates vendor-by-vendor negotiation over acceptable use and signals that firms unwilling to accept that baseline will be replaced,\" Tillipman said. \"It sounds like boring contract boilerplate, but it is really about procurement leverage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following Trump's announcement, Hegseth formally declared Anthropic as a supply-chain risk to national security, a designation previously applied only to foreign companies. As a result, no contractor, supplier or partner that does business with the U.S. military can \"conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That has potentially major implications for Anthropic, which recently raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation and disclosed $14 billion in annual run-rate revenue, driven mostly by increasing enterprise adoption of its products. More than 500 business customers now spend over $1 million annually on Anthropic's products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), which alongside Nvidia (NVDA) signed a strategic partnership with Anthropic last November, works with the Defense Department.  Amazon (AMZN), which has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic, recently detailed a plan to support the Pentagon through access to Amazon Web Services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before this week, Claude was the only AI model approved for classified use in the Pentagon. Claude was even used, through a Palantir Technologies (PLTR) partnership, to help the U.S. capture Venezuela's then president, Nicolás Maduro, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Elon Musk's xAI signed a deal to allow its controversial Grok model to be used for classified purposes earlier this week. Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns over potential safety issues with Grok, the Journal reports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A senior Pentagon official told MarketWatch that other companies are close to a similar agreement that would allow their AI models to be used for classified work. OpenAI and Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google have made versions of their AI models, ChatGPT and Gemini, available on the Defense Department's GenAI.mil enterprise platform used by civilian and military personnel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Representatives for Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Amazon, Nvidia and SoftBank pour $110 billion into OpenAI - raising the stakes for AI monetization </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Ranger, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I don't know why or how this money was withdrawn from a bank and put in an envelope - and I'm not sure I want to know. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In any case, depositing more than $10,000 into your bank account will likely trigger a mandatory currency-transaction report to both the Internal Revenue Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. This is standard procedure to detect potential money laundering. It does not mean that you have done anything wrong, so as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong, it should not create a problem for you. But there should be a paper trail in case you are audited. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What if you were to deposit this money in $10,000 increments to avoid triggering an alert? Deliberately breaking up financial transactions to avoid triggering reports that are required by law is called \"structuring,\" and it's illegal. The authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a magnifying glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and was not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of a death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's death. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax versus estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution. (Read more here.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you don't need this money, TurboTax suggests putting it into a trust. \"A trust allows you to pass assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate,\" it notes. \"Trusts are similar to wills, but trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and the associated expenses that wills typically have to go through. With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the bank teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent, the bank might request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer.
