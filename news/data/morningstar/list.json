The U.S. dollar index--which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies--is up 0.3% to 99.81, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for international buyers. The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year.

While the \"overarching bearish balance outlook continues to accelerate,\" risk premiums still exist as Russian output is likely to be a key focus, analysts at Rystad Energy say in a note. Rystad raised its Brent price forecast for 4Q to $63 a barrel from $62 a barrel.

The energy research firm estimates that between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day of Russian oil production could be curtailed in the next two months as a result of the latest U.S. sanctions, but the risk of immediate production shut-ins are extremely marginal at the moment. \"Given that any impact on Russian output will take time to materialize and with Moscow keen to project stability, it is unlikely Russia will oppose another modest OPEC+8 production increase,\" says Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis. \"For the Kremlin, staying composed and signaling control remain central to its strategy.\" In afternoon trade, Brent crude and WTI rise 0.5% to $64.69 and $60.94 a barrel, respectively.

In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slip 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -- </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Gold Rises With Focus on U.S.-China Trade, Fed Rate-Cut Prospects -- Market Talk </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  0847 GMT - Gold prices rise in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts.

Despite the commodity's narrowing price advantage over soybean oil, which could slow exports, BMI thinks palm oil remains competitively priced, providing a stable demand floor. BMI raises its 2025 average crude palm oil price forecast to 4,320 ringgit a ton from 4,150 ringgit a ton. Over the long term, slower production growth in Malaysia and Indonesia, due to land and environmental constraints, is expected to keep palm oil prices structurally firm, with a slight easing to 4,300 ringgit a ton in 2026, BMI adds.

The two oils often move in tandem due to their use in similar products. While increased soybean oil supply could weigh on demand for crude palm oil, firm biodiesel demand under Indonesia's B50 mandate, seasonal monsoon-related production slowdown and lower Malaysian inventories should limit downside risks. Unless China significantly scales up its soybean imports from the U.S., the overall impact on palm oil fundamentals may remain limited, she adds. TA maintains a neutral rating on Malaysia's plantation sector. It rates United Malacca at buy, Kuala Lumpur Kepong at hold, and SD Guthrie and IOI at sell.

Founder and CEO Ray Chen reflected on the brand's journey, sharing insights into its origins, values, and future direction.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">A Vision Inspired by Possibility</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">At the heart of TWOPAGES' decade-long journey is a simple but powerful idea: to make life at home easier, more beautiful, and more human. Years ago, while renovating his home, Ray Chen encountered hidden fees and a confusing curtain-buying process. What should have been a joyful part of creating a dream home had instead turned into a frustrating burden, prompting Ray Chen to explore possibilities beyond the traditional approach.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"That's how TWOPAGES came to life. We are not just a curtain brand — we are a solution,\" said Ray Chen. Determined to simplify the curtain-buying process, he built TWOPAGES on honesty, care, and innovation. From convincing factories to accept smaller custom orders to developing a user-friendly online platform, he introduced a more accessible approach to home furnishings. Today, TWOPAGES operates a 100,000-square-meter factory, sources from 100+ suppliers, and delivers over 1,000 custom orders daily, serving over 600,000 households worldwide.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808609/Image_Source_Ray_Chen_Founder_TWOPAGES.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808609/Image_Source_Ray_Chen_Founder_TWOPAGES.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Craftsmanship Meets Innovation</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">TWOPAGES is built on a philosophy of balance, where craftsmanship seamlessly blends with innovation. \"We use technology to express beauty, and craftsmanship to realize beauty,\" said Ray Chen.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This pursuit of balance is also embodied in the brand's very name. One \"page\" of the TWOPAGES story reflects emotional warmth, which is expressed through fine fabrics, precise tailoring, and artisanal finishing that bring comfort to everyday living. The other represents innovation and efficiency, showcased through smart measurement tools, menu-style customization, and fast, transparent delivery. Together, these elements empower TWOPAGES to redefine modern home design as accessible, effortless, and deeply meaningful.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Connection at the Core</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The TWOPAGES TOGETHER celebration also marked the finale of the TWOPAGES TOGETHER × Design Contest, a global co-design initiative inviting creators to explore new expressions of window aesthetics.

Only by understanding can we truly serve.\" That belief extends to the brand's global presence, reflected in its recent Times Square and Los Angeles billboard campaigns, which featured real designers and customer stories.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Through this contest and today's gathering, we're reminded that design is never just about aesthetics — it's about connection,\" Ray Chen added. \"That's what TWOPAGES TOGETHER truly stands for.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">From an online startup to an international brand, TWOPAGES' evolution mirrors Ray Chen's original vision that simplicity and trust should be at the heart of every home. Looking to the next decade, Ray Chen's ambition remains as grounded as it is forward-looking. \"Our dream is to use technology to save people time — and then help them invest that saved time into what truly matters: spending time with family, enjoying a quiet coffee in the afternoon sun, creating memories, feeling happiness,\" he said.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808611/Image_Source_TWOPAGES_TOGETHER_x_Design_Contest_Finale_1.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2808611/Image_Source_TWOPAGES_TOGETHER_x_Design_Contest_Finale_1.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About TWOPAGES</strong>\n</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Founded in 2015, TWOPAGES is a global home décor brand dedicated to creating premium, customizable window treatment solutions.

In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree.'Hemant Taneja </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hemant Taneja is a venture capitalist, author and CEO of General Catalyst, recognized for his insights into how artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and economies. Taneja was an early investor in companies including Stripe , Snap (SNAP), Grammarly, and Anduril, with a focus on applied AI, healthcare transformation and responsible innovation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His new book, \"The Transformation Principles: How to Create Enduring Change\" (co-authored with Kevin Maney), outlines nine principles for companies and managers to create sustainable change. Under Taneja's leadership, General Catalyst has raised billions of dollars while emphasizing ethical AI deployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In this recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Taneja discusses how individuals and companies can transform themselves, notes AI stocks with growth potential, and explains AI's huge risk and major opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What's the central message of your new book, and why is it timely now? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: We are entering a technology cycle where AI is going to be a transformative force, and it's going to transform many industries. There is an opportunity to actually make capitalism work for everybody if we make the right intentional choices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What does a company need to do to have a successful transformation through AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: For an organization to be transformative, it needs to have a culture of curiosity and generosity. They need to transform, but not disrupt. Disruption is the alternative to transformation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Should an individual begin transforming themselves today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: You have to. Steve Jobs said that first we have to change ourselves, then we change our industry, and then we change the world. We have to transform ourselves to deliver greater value and then gain the ability to transform the industries that we work in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Is AI going to be more transformative than the internet? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: It will be bigger. When the internet came, it was all about making things more efficient, but humans were still doing the work and software was making them more efficient. With AI, you're basically saying it will do the same job as a human for the most part. When ChatGPT first arrived, every CEO in every industry and in every country was thinking about what to do with it. It was the first time a technology hit the zeitgeist across the entire world at the same time (i.e., it became a global cultural phenomenon). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Many employees fear that AI means job loss. How can leaders introduce it in a way that builds trust and gets people on board? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: Change is scary for a lot of people, which is why trust matters. If AI people came into your company and said to your employees, \"We are going to transform your business,\" the natural response is that you're going to kill their jobs. That's because you didn't take the time to build trust. Instead, tell them, \"We're going to bring in this technology that will make you more effective and help you grow.\" They would embrace it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: Which companies are getting AI adoption right today? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: In my book I talked about companies such as Applied Intuition, Hippocratic AI, Stripe and Commure. Some of the AI model companies are obviously doing very well. If you look at the consensus, it would be OpenAI and Anthropic. There are also open-source companies, such as Mistral, that are building AI models that are quite interesting. There are also companies that are imagining modern call centers, the evolution of the legal department, how accounting is being done with AI, how marketing and sales are going to be done using AI, and how to empower sales reps. Those types of companies are going to be very, very interesting over the next 10 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest risks of AI adoption? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja:  We are going to transition from a culture of solving problems to a culture of asking questions, which will be a big transition. We want to make sure we're not losing our cognitive capabilities, our ability to think, and our ability to solve problems. How do you make sure you're using AI to improve what you're doing, but not using AI to be lazy and not think? There is a trap you can fall into, whereas these technologies get better and better, and you stop thinking. Think about how to get from point A to point B today. People turn on the map program and lose all touch of how things are laid out physically. You don't want that to happen to all concepts in your brain. It is a downside if we become too reliant and give up sharpening our own cognitive skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What are the key steps leaders must take to successfully integrate AI into their organizations? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There are four steps leaders must take to make AI work: First, they have to change their data infrastructure and their IT (information technology) department so they can adopt AI. Then they must train them with the data. Next, they have to change their workforce because they now have humans and AI working together. What a lot of CEOs got wrong is they didn't realize that the only way a profound change will happen in their company is if they demonstrate courage and conviction. They have to encourage their people to take risks and show them how it will make them more successful. Otherwise, people get scared, and they won't use it. That's how a lot of organizations get stuck. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What is the biggest cautionary lesson leaders should keep in mind as they adopt AI? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: There will always be those who use AI for societal harm. We have to trust the system to build the right guardrails. Over time, this technology will be properly regulated in terms of who gets access to it and how it gets applied. Like any new technology, it could be bumpy. I have an optimistic view that human beings will find a way to leverage these profound technologies for good in the aggregate, such as what happened with nuclear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: With AI reshaping so many industries, how can employees protect their careers and make sure they thrive in an AI-driven workplace? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: The most concrete and useful advice I can give is to learn how to adopt AI to do your job more effectively. That's really what you should be doing. This means asking the right questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and being more strategic in your own work. It's a huge opportunity for employees. In our company, we're encouraging everybody to use AI to do their jobs to a greater degree. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch: What guidance would you give recent graduates entering today's fast-changing job market? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taneja: To understand that the world is going to change a lot in the next few years. When kids used to graduate 10 years ago, they would list all the software they knew how to use on their resume. Now we're in a world where that software is changing every three months, and you're constantly having to learn and keep up to be effective at your job. Being a lifelong learner is important. The world is an empty canvas.

(QCOM), despite growth struggles for the iPhone manufacturer. \"I would own any of these over Apple any day of the week,\" he wrote, while disclosing positions in Samsung and Qualcomm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Below are the forward price-to-earnings multiples for those five names, based on FactSet data </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Company                             Forward P/E \n   Apple                               33.02 \n   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  25.05 \n   MediaTek                            17.64 \n   Qualcomm                            14.41 \n   Samsung                             13.07 </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Needham's Laura Martin thought Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) stock (GOOG) looked like a more intriguing play than Apple's, given that shares of the Google parent company trade at a discount to Apple shares despite far better growth prospects. Alphabet's stock trades at 25.8 times forward earnings, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet's revenue is growing two to three times faster than Apple's, Martin added. And the internet giant has a more tangible strategy around large-language models and generative AI than Apple does, plus leading or near-leading positions in AI, search, mobile, video and the cloud, according to Martin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple faces a \"key strategic problem,\" in her view, because it can only use generative AI to enhance its ecosystem. Alphabet can use generative AI to improve Android as well - but through the cloud it can also \"charge a fee for thousands of other companies to use its LLM, which aids its enterprise profitability and gives it the ability lower Android prices and improve its operating leverage faster,\" she wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS's David Vogt joined the others in flagging Apple's high stock multiple. He acknowledged that \"near-term iPhone demand is solid,\" but said Apple shares were trading at 34 times his estimates for fiscal 2026 earnings, making for a premium of 40%-plus relative to the S&amp;P 500 SPX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Based on historical relative valuations, material share price appreciation in our view will likely have to come from positive earnings revisions,\" he wrote, as it's been \"difficult to sustain\" a premium of that magnitude. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Alphabet's stock looks like a better play than Meta's in the AI race </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Paul Hannon </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of England is set to take a big step toward embracing uncertainty as it follows through on the recommendations made by former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke after a review that was critical of its forecasting record. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Published in April 2024, the Bernanke review was one of the first steps taken by a leading central bank to understand why it underestimated a surge in prices that began in early 2021 and has yet to be fully tamed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Bernanke recommended that the BOE place more stress on developments that could upend its expectations for the U.K. economy and future interest rates, and less emphasis on a \"central\" forecast for growth and inflation that communicated too much certainty about the future. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The BOE has been edging away from its pre-Bernanke practices over the intervening period, and has offered a number of scenarios for growth and inflation that members of the Monetary Policy Committee have referred to in speeches as a way of setting out how their decisions might change with the circumstances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But the most decisive step forward will come Thursday, officials said, when the BOE publishes its quarterly Monetary Policy Report alongside its latest rate decision, which investors expect to be a hold at 4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Staff at the BOE outlined the reasoning behind the shift in a paper published earlier this month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The intention behind the changes is to highlight uncertainties about the outlook and how they might affect the path of interest rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  There will be more scenarios, and they will come with possible paths for the key rate, although those will be determined by policy rules formulated by the BOE's economists, rather than reflecting the views of individual rate setters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"As with any other input, there is no mechanical link between policy simulations and real-world monetary policy decisions,\" staff wrote in their paper. \"And these tools are stylised and simplified. So, they do not accurately reflect the MPC's real-world reaction function.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That is a distinction that reflects the BOE's continued reluctance to employ the \"dot plot\" favored by the Federal Reserve, which gives the interest rate forecasts of individual voting members. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  However, the nine members of the MPC will be given around 200 words each to explain their view of the rate decision and the outlook. Previously, the MPC's debate had been summarized by BOE officials, and the identities of the members making the arguments referred to in the minutes had been kept hidden, although their votes had not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  One of Bernanke's key recommendations was that policy makers should be clear when they as individuals don't fully believe in the assumptions that underlie the central forecast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The MPC's forecasts for growth and inflation are based on the assumption that the interest rate they set changes as investors expect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But policy makers often have a very different view of how rates should change, and that has led to confusion. In late 2022, for example, the BOE forecast that the U.K. economy would enter a deep recession, but that forecast assumed rates were going to rise more sharply than policymakers intended. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  What policymakers were actually doing was signaling that they wouldn't raise the key rate as rapidly as investors expected because such a big move in borrowing costs would tank the economy. However, business and consumer confidence was weakened by the recession call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central forecast is not going away, but it will play a less important role in decision making, as Bernanke recommended. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 09:44 ET (13:44 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
