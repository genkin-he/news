This week also marks the first missed paycheck for the nation's air-traffic controllers, while Transportation Security Administration employees, including airport screeners, are also going without pay. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That increases the risk of further flight cancellations mere weeks away from the air-travel Super Bowl: Thanksgiving week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If we are still going [with the shutdown] by Thanksgiving, it'll be a disaster in the air\" in terms of delays, said Ernest Arvai, president of AirInsight Group, who noted that Thanksgiving also usually brings weather delays on top of the crowds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Roughly 14,000 air-traffic controllers and some 60,000 TSA agents are considered essential workers, and are thus expected to continue working during the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They may increasingly be calling out of work, however. \"Staffing triggers,\" indicating a shortage of controllers, drove some flight cancellations and delays in recent days, in addition to the more usual halts triggered by bad weather or construction at major airports this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Staffing triggers are expected to increase throughout the rest of the week as paychecks remain held up, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, on its website, urges air-traffic controllers to \"rise to the occasion.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our union or our professions,\" the Union said on its webpage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AirInsight's Arvai said air-traffic controllers have done a great public service during the shutdown. \"But all it takes is a couple of guys being out\" for delays, as the system is already operating under long-running shortages, he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It takes three to five years of experience for an air-traffic controller to work in high-density areas. Only about a third of the people vying to become a controller complete training, and of those, \"the stress gets to about half\" in their first few months on the job, Arvai said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"To get one controller, you probably have had to train five. It's not a job for everybody, let me put it that way,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In several interviews this week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned of even more air-travel disruption as the shutdown grinds on. Duffy said at an event that \"this year, on average, the delays that are associated with staffing triggers, with air-traffic controllers, is 5%,\" but that they were 44% on Sunday and 24% on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So far in 2025, which is considered a normal year, around 20% of flights have been delayed for a variety of reasons, aviation analytics company Cirium said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Major travel groups have yet to issue their predictions for Thanksgiving-week travel, which broke records last year. Travel and leisure group AAA said last year that nearly 6 million people were expected to fly during the holiday week, or 2% more than the previous year. Executives at major U.S. airlines recently expressed optimism about holiday travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If travelers feel the shutdown pain at airports, airlines feel it on their operations beyond the cancellations and delays. Among personnel furloughed are aviation-safety professionals, including aircraft-certification engineers and aerospace engineers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The shutdown also threatens to halt the progress U.S. airlines have seen in getting planes in and out of airports on time. Before the shutdown, U.S. delays and cancellations were trending down this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite several well-publicized problems in the spring, including a deadly air crash in Washington, D.C., and long delays at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, 2025 had been essentially tied with last year as far as the number of flights canceled or delayed for more than 15 minutes, the industry's on-time marker. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Rich fliers are making United and Delta billions by buying premium perks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Robert Schroeder in Washington contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Research from Harvard University professor Rebecca Diamond has shown that without high-skilled immigration, the U.S. would be one-third less innovative. Human capital is not the only key factor in U.S. innovation prowess, but by narrowing access to high-skilled talent from around the world, the U.S. could see slower productivity growth in the years ahead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other countries could gain major ground in the global battle for high-skilled talent thanks to the U.S.'s changing policies. America attracts the best and brightest workers from around the world, but now other countries are moving to open more doors for superstar talent, just as the U.S. tightens its pathways. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Source: Haver Analytics; author calculations </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Changes and challenges </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration imposed a $100,000 H-1B application fee in September. Prior to the proclamation, H-1B fees to the government ranged from $2,000 to $5,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The H-1B is a temporary work visa that requires at least a bachelor's degree and allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, healthcare and finance. The new fee would not apply to other visas - including, for example, student visas. Important questions remain about how and to whom the new fee will apply, but as written, its impact is certain, and designed to drastically increase the cost of using the H-1B program. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has since released guidance clarifying that the new fee will not apply to currently valid H-1B visas or to petitions requesting a change of status, amendment, or extension of stay for a beneficiary inside the United States. But the impact of the change is certain, with the cost of using the H-1B program set to rise drastically. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Supporters of the new policy say that the H-1B program reduces opportunities for American workers seeking highly paid jobs. However, this new fee is a blow to certain industries that now will face much higher costs to sponsor prospective hires, and it might deter overseas talent from coming to the U.S. For example, some tech companies have tens of thousands of staff on H-1B visas. Even if only a fraction of these companies' new hires require sponsorship, a $100,000 fee per petition adds up to many millions of dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The new fee will certainly have major impacts on the use of the H-1B program as a way to fill critical high-skilled workforce gaps,\" said Bo Cooper, executive director of the Fragomen Center for Strategy and Applied Insights. \"The United States is certainly still open for business for top international students and professionals, but employers will be monitoring carefully the aggregated impacts of these changes and the possible effects on their global talent strategies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The cost to U.S. innovation </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the U.S. at around 700,000, although there is no official data. That amounts to less than 0.5% of U.S. employees. Congress has limited the number of new H-1B visas to 85,000 per year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While H-1B workers are a small share of the U.S. workforce, policies aimed at reducing high-skilled immigration into the country could have outsize economic impacts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The study by Diamond and her co-authors found that immigrants account for 16% of inventors and authored 23% of patents, indicating that immigrants contribute an outsize share to innovation. (Diamond is an Andersen Institute advisory board member.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not only did immigrants author more patents, but Diamond's study also found that immigrants improved innovation for U.S.-born collaborators, pushing them to be more creative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In total, Diamond's study found that immigrants account for 32% of aggregate innovation, about half of which comes from improving the human capital of their native-born collaborators. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Source: Bernstein, Diamond, McQuade, and Pousada (2021) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Already, there are signs that the U.S. policy change is a golden opportunity for other countries to repatriate or attract superstar talent. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, in response to the hike in price for U.S. H-1B visas, the U.K. is said to be exploring proposals to abolish visa fees for skilled foreign workers, including scientists, academics and digital experts, in a bid to drive growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country would introduce new proposals to welcome skilled foreign workers. \"This is an opportunity for Canada,\" he said. In British Columbia, Jobs Minister Ravi Kahlon responded to Trump's policy by calling on workers in the U.S. to move north. \"We're inviting tech talent, innovators and scientists to come to B.C. and be part of building the economic engine of Canada's new economy!\" he wrote on the social-media platform X. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Considering the vital role that high-skilled immigrants play in driving innovation, if other countries can capitalize on this moment and attract a larger share of high-skilled talent from around the world, the implications could be profound. U.S. innovation exceptionalism, economic outperformance, and even the faster earnings growth of U.S. public companies compared to overseas peers, could all be threatened. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Khia Kurtenbach is chief of staff at the Andersen Institute for Finance and Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: I've got an H-1B work visa and I'm worried about my job status.

He was self-employed and had this 10-acre home for 30 years. We almost lost everything when he got sick. He was $20,000 behind in the mortgage. We have to refinance next year and pay his business debts off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I increased my income.

You increased your income, and you are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. You are using the one asset he has to pay off his debts, and you're doing so with the cooperation and assistance of his family. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether or not you decide to go for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage depends a) on the interest rate and b) on your husband and his estate's ability to pay off this loan. There may come a time where you will need to sell this house to pay for care when his dementia progresses, but you can only ever do one thing, one day at a time. He is fortunate to have you at his side. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other long-term plans you can make. Your husband would do well to sign a power-of-attorney document while he is of sound mind and has the legal capacity to do so, if he has not done so already. The power of attorney should be \"durable\" and should specify that you will make decisions on his behalf when he is incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He can also assign you to hold power of attorney for healthcare decisions. This will ensure that he has someone to act on his behalf in a medical context. If he does not wish to be on life support, for example, this advanced healthcare directive would say so. A living will and/or living trust can also provide additional instructions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My husband has dementia and will need care. Will Medicaid go after my money if I use it to pay off our mortgage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Importantly, setting up a trust would help your husband's executor - that is, you - to avoid probate. Making sure you have these documents in place before he enters mid- or late-stage dementia will prevent complications later on, like having to apply to be his guardian or conservator, which can be a lengthy and complicated process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is also the time to look into Social Security benefits for your husband. \"Someone with early-onset Alzheimer's who is younger than 65 can qualify for fast-track eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits,\" according to AARP. \"After two years of receiving SSDI benefits, they can qualify for Medicare before age 65.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your husband could also purchase a private supplemental policy, Medigap, or look into a Medicare Advantage plan. \"Medicare will cover hospice care, which provides as much comfort as possible to terminally ill patients in the last days or months of life,\" AARP notes. \"A doctor must certify that they have a life expectancy of six months or less.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, what you have created for yourselves after this diagnosis is something that was taken from you at that time: certainty. You may not know exactly how much time it will take for your husband's dementia to progress to the stage where he will need full-time care, but you have put in place enough financial safeguards to protect you both when you get there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am highly alarmed by the proposed changes to retirement accounts': I don't want bitcoin or private equity in my 401(k).

Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $8.71 billion in revenue, which would translate to about 16% growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That comes after Chief Executive Michael Miebach used Mastercard's earnings release to call out robust spending from both consumers and businesses, which helped the company post 9% growth in gross dollar volume for its third quarter and 10% growth in purchase volume. Those both matched rates seen in the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Across different segments of the population, whether it's affluent or mass market, we're seeing good healthy trends,\" Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra added in a conversation with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Visa Inc. (V) also pointed to consumer \"resilience\" when it delivered its numbers earlier this week. On Visa's earnings call, executives highlighted \"relatively consistent\" growth among different income bands, \"with the highest-spend band continuing to grow the fastest.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Visa earnings offer an upbeat read on consumer-spending habits </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That Visa and Mastercard are humming along while cracks show up in some pockets of the economy underscores the high-level nature of these businesses. As Visa pointed out earlier this week, the company is broadly exposed to debit and credit trends; so is Mastercard. That means the companies are relatively insulated from trends like consumers trading down to lower-priced products, as long as customers keep spending in aggregate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers \"might make choices as to how they spend, but the size of the wallet that they're spending is what we get to see,\" Mastercard's Mehra said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Fiserv's stock plunges 40% on worst day ever. Outlook reset is deemed 'difficult to comprehend.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the third quarter, that spending helped drive $8.6 billion in revenue for Mastercard, a hair above the FactSet analyst consensus of $8.54 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.38, while analysts had been modeling $4.32. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mastercard benefits from its faster-growth services business that consists of fraud products, research insights and other value-add offerings for financial-services customers. Services revenue was up 25% in the third quarter, outpacing the 17% revenue growth seen for the overall business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Artificial intelligence could be a further tailwind to the services business, and to Mastercard's spending-related revenue. The company offers tools for agentic commerce, through which AI agents can make purchases on behalf of consumers. From a services perspective, there are opportunities to sell merchants and financial partners on tools for authentication, loyalty and other areas that they might want when rolling out AI commerce offerings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Mehra thinks AI agents could help spur more transactions, which is good for Mastercard since the company generates revenue related to both the dollar value of transactions and the number of transactions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He explained that a consumer who is buying shoes and who also needs socks might buy them both from the same place to save time - but an AI agent might shop around and buy the items from two different places. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"What we will see is that the dollar value of spend might be the same across me buying a shoe and the socks, but you might get two transactions opposed to one,\" Mehra said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read on: American Express sees credit-card spending accelerate </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
