            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jobless claims show most companies are avoiding big layoffs </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some companies are hiring, but finding a job is not easy these days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market appears here to stay - at least in 2026. Most CEOs of U.S. companies say they have no plans to increase the size of their workforce this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The number of people being hired slowed sharply in 2026 to one of the lowest levels in more than a decade amid a burst of uncertainty triggered by high U.S. tariffs and the rapid evolvement of artificial intelligence as a potential labor-saving tool. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, most companies have refrained from widespread layoffs given a chronic shortage of skilled workers. Sales have also been strong enough to retain current staff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Economists have called this a \"low-hire, low-fire\" job market. The latest weekly report on jobless claims bears out this trend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Initial jobless claims rose by 4,000 to 212,000 in the seven days that ended Feb. 21, the government said. That's an exceedingly low level historically and reflects how few layoffs are taking place in the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bad news? The labor market is unlikely to see much improvement this year, based on a new survey of the CEOs of America's largest companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fewer  than one-third of business leaders say they plan to beef up their workforce anytime soon, the Conference Board reported Thursday. And some 41% say they plan to keep staff at current levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only 28% say they might reduce employment, the nonprofit board said in its quarterly survey of CEOs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lack of layoffs has been a key driver of the five-year-old economic expansion. Most people who want a job have one, and their spending continues to propel the economy forward. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If bad times were coming, rising jobless claims would be one of the earliest warning signs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Key details: The number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, fell by 31,000 to 1.83 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Remarkably, continuing claims are lower now than they were one year ago, a sign the labor market is no longer getting any worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These claims had risen steadily for several years and reached a high of almost 2 million last fall before tapering off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The labor-market data has been quite a bit better recently,\" Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran said Thursday on Fox Business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big picture: Barring a recession, the U.S. job market probably can't get much worse after a rough 2025. The U.S. only added 181,000 new jobs last year, the smallest increase in any year the economy was not in recession since 2003. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bright side? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEOs are more optimistic about the economy, and a majority expect their businesses will improve in the next six months. If the economy accelerates, it would likely lead to more hiring than expected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Looking ahead: \"There is no sign of layoffs picking up. Hiring remains anemic, but the labor market is not getting worse and is showing many signs of stabilizing,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&amp;P 500 SPX were set to rise slightly in Thursday trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Primerica, Inc. (Primerica) (headquartered in Duluth, GA) [NYSE: PRI], which is the holding company for the group’s insurance and non-insurance operating companies. AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) on $600 million, 2.8% senior unsecured notes, due 2031, of Primerica. The outlook of all these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Primerica Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica’s credit ratings continue to recognize the group’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s balance sheet remains a core strength, characterized by strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Primerica has an investment profile that focuses on fixed-income assets, while maintaining only modest exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, the company’s business model does rely heavily on the use of reinsurance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica reinforced its position as an industry leader, consistently reporting high levels of earnings and top-tier return-on-equity measures among its peers. Steady premium growth, fueled by a vast and geographically diversified distribution system spanning the U.S. and Canadian marketplaces, continues to improve the company's operational strength. Primerica has extensive agent recruitment and a well-established monitoring system to ensure compliance and steady premium growth. Primerica’s use of highly rated reinsurance partners mitigates term life insurance mortality risk, a core component of its strong balance sheet management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe group’s business profile is focused on its core term life insurance offering, particularly the investments made in its simplified issue product. Beyond the Primerica Group, Primerica also offers the distribution of primarily third-party investment and savings products and other non-life products.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat co-founder also sees Mag 7 selling nearing an end </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat's Tom Lee is calling the end, nearly, of the AI scare trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia delivered solid results, but there's just a smattering of applause so far, and no sign of a rally for Thursday as investors near the end of what has been a tough month for stocks tied to the AI trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also declared \"markets got it wrong\" over the software selloff, so we'll see if his view takes hold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You'll find some concurrence with Huang in our call of the day from co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who believes that selloffs for software, Magnificent 7 stocks and crypto are nearly done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee said markets tend to bottom on bad news, flagging the viral AI doom post from Citrini Research that shook up investors at the start of the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I think that we're seeing signs that we could be far along into that bottom,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Mag 7 stocks MAGS have been rising since Feb. 17. Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as the rotation out of those stocks nears extreme levels. He says the broader software decline is almost over, in its final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the final weeks of their own pullback. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That sets the stage for an even stronger March, with an average historical gain of about 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Adriano Marchese </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Restaurant Brands International backed its growth targets for the next two years, saying it remains on track to expand its global restaurant network and will return $1.6  billion to shareholders in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Canadian-American owner of Tim Hortons and Burger King at its investor day on Thursday reaffirmed its organic adjusted operating income growth target of 8% or more through 2028, noting it already exceeded the mark in 2024 and 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Part of the company's plan is also to grow its restaurant network by 5% each year, which would equate to about 1,800 net new restaurants a year by 2028. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In the U.S. and Canada, it plans to focus its expansion on Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs, which is expected to contribute about half the new stores there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In China, the company expects to have over 200 net new units in 2028, and said the pace of growth will speed up beyond that. For the its other main markets, including India, the U.K., Mexico, France and Japan, RBI expects to deliver about 700 units per year by 2028. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  RBI is aiming for the transition to a 99% franchised model, corporate investment-grade leverage by 2028. It said it is actively working to refranchise the Burger King US company restaurant portfolio to a base of about 300 to 500 home market restaurants and to place Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil with long-term local partners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Shareholders can also expect returns. RBI said it will resume share repurchases, with around $500 million expected in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Share repurchases are expected to grow over time as the company taps into its free cash flow for buybacks, which it says will accelerate as its investment grade improves. In addition, RBI is targeting a payout ratio of around 60% of its excess free cash flow for its dividend. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 09:02 ET (14:02 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
