Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as the rotation out of those stocks nears extreme levels. He says the broader software decline is almost over, in its final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the final weeks of their own pullback. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That sets the stage for an even stronger March, with an average historical gain of about 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement. The current one is up to 90%, so he thinks that process is nearly finished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is regarded by some as one of Wall Street's more accurate forecasters who correctly told investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market. But he's also made pretty wrongheaded calls on crypto, suggesting last summer that bitcoin could \"easily get to $200,000\" by the end of 2025, and has predicted it could top $1 million in a few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee also weighed in on Nvidia's earnings, pointing to record quarterly revenue and strong net income, plus shares trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, so about half of Costco's (COST) multiple. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's what's necessary to return the incredibly concentrated U.S. stock market to normal levels </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are edging higher, with gold (GC00), silver (SI00) and oil (CL00) under pressure. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Key asset performance                                                Last       5d     1m      YTD     1y \n   S&amp;P 500                                                              6946.13    0.94%  -0.46%  1.47%   16.62% \n   Nasdaq Composite                                                     23,152.08  1.75%  -2.96%  -0.39%  21.37% \n   10-year Treasury                                                     4.054      -2.60  -18.60  -11.80  -21.10 \n   Gold                                                                 5203.8     4.16%  -3.83%  20.12%  77.50% \n   Oil                                                                  65.62      1.05%  3.34%   14.30%  -4.65% \n   Data: MarketWatch.

For the its other main markets, including India, the U.K., Mexico, France and Japan, RBI expects to deliver about 700 units per year by 2028. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  RBI is aiming for the transition to a 99% franchised model, corporate investment-grade leverage by 2028. It said it is actively working to refranchise the Burger King US company restaurant portfolio to a base of about 300 to 500 home market restaurants and to place Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil with long-term local partners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Shareholders can also expect returns. RBI said it will resume share repurchases, with around $500 million expected in 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Share repurchases are expected to grow over time as the company taps into its free cash flow for buybacks, which it says will accelerate as its investment grade improves. In addition, RBI is targeting a payout ratio of around 60% of its excess free cash flow for its dividend. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 09:02 ET (14:02 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, other income (expense), income tax (expense) benefit, (gain) loss on foreign currency, (gain) loss on transfer of assets, reorganization costs, and other supplemental adjustments. Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, debt refinancing costs, acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring charges. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future.

At the time of clock-in, the system simultaneously captures GPS coordinates for geolocation, enabling IDD organizations to validate services rendered and reduce risk associated with documentation completed outside of appropriate service settings.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Once clocked in, DSPs can easily access schedules, individual-specific tools, and documentation workflows directly within the app. DSP Assist supports key service delivery activities including time tracking, medication administration, behavioral tracking, goal tracking, daily notes, and individual navigation — all designed to reflect real-world IDD care workflows. Documentation entered through DSP Assist syncs back to Cx360 Enterprise in real time, maintaining a single source of truth without disconnected systems or duplicate data entry.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">DSP Assist also supports service delivery in environments with limited or no connectivity. The application continues to function even when offline, allowing DSPs to document care without interruption, with data syncing back to Enterprise once connectivity is restored. Access to information about individuals served remains restricted until staff are clocked in at the appropriate service location, helping protect sensitive data and reduce unnecessary PHI exposure.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"DSP Assist addresses one of the most persistent challenges in IDD care: ensuring services are delivered, documented, and billed accurately while protecting the information of the people DSPs support,\" says Michael Arevalo, PsyD, Director of Clinical Strategy at Core Solutions. \"DSP Assist strengthens accountability and compliance while giving DSPs practical tools that fit how care actually happens. It also reflects our focus at Core Solutions on building technology that improves care and oversight without disrupting daily workflows.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">DSP Assist is designed for IDD provider organizations seeking greater operational control, documentation accuracy, and confidence in compliance without adding burden to DSP workflows. With DSP Assist, organizations gain clearer visibility into service delivery, improved confidence in billing and compliance, and stronger alignment between daily DSP work and Enterprise records without making the delivery of care more cumbersome.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">IDD organizations can learn more about DSP Assist and see the application in action by <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4627294-1&amp;h=3292667836&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finfo.coresolutionsinc.com%2Frequest-a-demo&amp;a=scheduling+a+demonstration\" tabindex=\"0\">scheduling a demonstration</a>.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Media contact:<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Elise Paul<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Director of Marketing<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Core Solutions, Inc.<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:409607@email4pr.com\" tabindex=\"0\">409607@email4pr.com</a><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>(610) 687-6080</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH95738&amp;sd=2026-02-26\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/core-solutions-launches-the-dsp-assist-mobile-app-for-compliant-idd-service-delivery-302698131.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/core-solutions-launches-the-dsp-assist-mobile-app-for-compliant-idd-service-delivery-302698131.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Core Solutions</p></span>\n</div>",
