The term only came up once on the company's prior earnings call, and there were scattered instances before that as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fungibility refers to the idea of being replaceable and interchangeable. In Microsoft's case, the company seemed to be referring to \"fungible\" infrastructure that can serve broad-based needs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While some on Wall Street are worried that Microsoft is overbuilding to meet the demands of a small set of high-profile AI companies, like OpenAI, that have uncertain financial futures, Microsoft's management sees its work as much broader than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Microsoft's stock is falling in the face of upbeat earnings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In response to an analyst's question about how the company makes sure it isn't overbuilding, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said Microsoft focuses on efficiencies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You have to start with building out a very fungible fleet,\" he said on the call. \"It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training,\" a reference to different types of AI workloads. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The term applies not just to the functional aspects of Microsoft's cloud business but also to the sorts of customers the company serves, according to Nadella. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You don't want to build for a digital native ... as if you're just doing hosting for them,\" he said. By being \"fungible,\" Microsoft lays the groundwork to \"ensure the build is for the broad customer base.\" The company sees broadening interest in AI services as enterprise companies are still early in their adoption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts noted the heavy use of the word, with mixed views. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Management spoke a lot of 'fungible' capacity, which seems to mean Azure can satisfy the demands for different kinds of Public Cloud workloads, which is probably true, but management's commentary causes us to question the company's ability to realize comfortable profitability in AI training, something we're confident that Oracle can achieve,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note titled: \"Fungible Quarter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey said Microsoft \"highlighted its fungible fleet that can be used across the AI lifecycle, be continuously modernized, and used across the company's platform of services.\" He noted that Microsoft has been using software to make its hardware more efficient. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft executives made their comments while also talking up plans for enhanced capital-spending growth this year. Whereas Microsoft previously projected a lower capex growth rate this fiscal year than last fiscal year, CFO Amy Hood said on Wednesday that she now expects this year's rate to be higher, in pursuit of \"accelerating demand.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft spent $34.9 billion on capex in the fiscal first quarter, more than $10 billion above what analysts were expecting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Meta's stock slides toward its worst day in years as Wall Street pans 'runaway' AI spending </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Kenneth Rapoza </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. and China reach a truce, but America's national security depends on its self-sufficiency </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neodymium stone, part of the rare earth group, is the world's strongest magnetic ore. U.S. rare-earths companies need to decouple from dependence on China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump's whirlwind Asia tour was a headwind for critical U.S.-based rare-earths miners, including MP Materials (MP), USA Rare Earth (USAR) and Energy Fuels (UUUU). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bull case for these companies remains now that the dust is settling. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to postpone export controls on rare earths at their meeting in South Korea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the push for U.S. rare-earths companies to decouple from dependence on China still matters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The main concern I had about these companies during Trump's Asia visit was that the president was focusing on the short-term supply of critical minerals - of which rare earths are a part. Rare-earth elements are mostly used to make high-powered magnets - those needed to manufacture a gyroscope for a fighter jet, for example. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China owns this supply chain and has consistently threatened to withhold supply. Critical mineral pacts with Australia, Malaysia and Thailand are a short-term solution, and  signaled to investors that these are the countries to invest in - not the U.S.  Energy Fuels, for example, imports materials from these producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the U.S.-Australia critical-minerals framework, for example, the Export-Import Bank of the United States issued seven Letters of Interest totaling more than $2.2 billion to Australian-owned projects, including Arafura Rare Earths (AU:ARU), Northern Minerals (AU:NTU), Graphex Group (GRFXY) and others. Those mined goods will be exported to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's deal with Japan, in contrast, is an \"America First\" arrangement that provides funding for U.S. mining operations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Japanese are investing in U.S. smelting of copper, a critical mineral, and a lithium-ion-phosphate processing plant. Much of this investment will support critical mineral supply chains and energy infrastructure. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When you are facing a behemoth nonmarket economy like China that is mostly only interested in full employment, you don't have a lot of options </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump is thinking in the short term with these recent deals in order to get supply into the U.S. and avoid China. The Trump administration is also thinking in the long term, with local miners in mind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Remember, there is an ongoing Section 232 tariff investigation into critical minerals. Miners are convinced this will lead to tariffs that protect industry investment. The market should not be too spooked by that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently announced that the government would create a strategic minerals reserve, not just for defense, but for national economic security - something the private sector can dip into. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The administration also implemented price floors. If China decides to overproduce a commodity to collapse prices globally and destroy margins of American miners, the U.S. government will make up the difference. Bessent said the goal is to build a deep, domestic critical-minerals industry. He said the tactic was \"the equivalent of Operation Warp Speed\" in the COVID-19 vaccine era. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some argue this all sounds like Chinese-style industrial policy. The problem is, when you are facing a behemoth nonmarket economy like China that is mostly only interested in full employment, you don't have a lot of options to compete.  You are never going to beat China on price or labor. China has surpassed every other market economy to become No. 2. The U.S. is the last man standing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump remade the narrative on China starting in 2017. There is now a rethinking occurring among American corporations about the so-called Asia pivot. Supply chains are getting closer to home. Others are actually coming home. This holds true for mined goods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Demand in the U.S. seems apparent. Apple (AAPL) partnered with MP Materials in July to expand domestic magnet manufacturing. GM (GM) did the same with MP in 2021 and this year entered into a joint venture with Lithium Americas' (LAC) Thacker Pass mine in Nevada to gain access to the lithium it will use in EV batteries.
