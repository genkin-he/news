LeBlanc cited, for instance, talks last fall between Ottawa and Washington to ease tariffs on key sectors like steel, aluminum and automobiles, which President Trump later terminated due to anger over a Canadian ad that questioned the use of tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  LeBlanc said Canada wants the U.S. to recommit to a trilateral trade pact. Furthermore, he added, \"there have always been bilateral arrangements as between the three countries. That's not new… [And] we need to get a bilateral deal with the United States to take pressure off the sectoral tariffs.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The sectoral tariffs, of up to 50%, have squeezed Canada's manufacturing sector. Nonfarm payrolls data issued Thursday indicated that factories shed workers in December, for a year-over-year decline of 2.6%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  LeBlanc said he expects to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the coming days. Greer told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday that Canada will have to live with U.S. tariffs as part of a revised USMCA. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"If Canada wants to agree that we can have some level of higher tariff on them while they open up their markets to us on things like dairy and other things, then that's a helpful conversation,\" Greer said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Earlier this week, LeBlanc told Canadian senators he remained optimistic about USMCA's future, noting that the White House provided an exemption to a new U.S. tariff, of up to 15%, so long as the goods entering the U.S. comply with the trilateral pact. The Bank of Canada has labeled the pending review of USMCA as a key risk to the economic outlook. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 14:35 ET (19:35 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "title": "Musk, Altman and China are fighting to control a potential $320 billion market for brain implants",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's still very early days for brain chips that let people control devices with their thoughts - but the market opportunity has become increasingly intriguing to tech CEOs and politicians </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elon Musk's Neuralink is among the most visible brain-computer interface companies around. But OpenAI's Sam Altman and a growing number of Chinese startups are aiming to challenge its lead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elon Musk, Sam Altman and a growing number of rivals are all fighting to become the leading player in the nescient but potentially lucrative market for brain implants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the global market for brain-computer interface, or BCI, technology could be worth $80 billion by 2035. A decade after that, the market for BCIs in the U.S. alone could be valued at $320 billion, the bank said in a Wednesday note to investors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brain-computer interface systems aren't new. The first major testing of such technology came in the 1970s in California, although roots can be found decades earlier. In the late 1990s, neurologist Philip Kennedy developed the first BCI to allow a severely paralyzed patient to move a computer cursor using their brain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As BCI research has developed, so has the opportunity to make money off of the technology, though companies often emphasize the humanitarian benefits they can provide. According to data from Tracxn Technologies (IN:543638), which tracks private markets, there are 278 BCI companies around the world. Collectively, they've raised more than $4 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The most visible is Neuralink, the BCI startup founded by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk in 2016 that's reportedly worth $9 billion. Since January 2024, the startup has given its \"Telepathy\" implant to 21 patients with paralysis, allowing them to use phones, computers or robotic limbs with their thoughts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Neuralink is also running a clinical trial for an implant designed to restore speech. Musk has said that, pending regulatory approval, Neuralink is ready for a trial of Blindsight, which could help restore patients' vision. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the end of the decade, Neuralink wants to implant its tech in a \"otherwise healthy\" person because the benefit outweighs the risk, President DJ Seo said last September. That could mean people would be able to pay for the ability to use their phones without physically doing anything. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In October, Neuralink submitted a scientific paper to the New England Journal of Medicine that described the first three patients implanted with one of its devices. It would be its first peer-reviewed publication with human data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The startup's approach includes placing electrodes near certain neurons after a protective layer around the brain and a piece of the patient's skull are removed. Then, Neuralink uses a robot to insert microscopic threads into the brain. After that, the implant is placed in the skull and skin is closed over it, according to the company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Competing with Neuralink is Synchron, a BCI company that has implanted 10 patients with devices designed to avoid open-brain surgery and recently raised $200 million. The firm has been backed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and was the first BCI company with connectivity to Apple (AAPL) devices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Pandromics, another competitor, implanted its BCI in a human for the first time last June. Its Connexus BCI is designed to restore communication for people with severe motor impairment as a result of spinal-cord injuries or ALS. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's also the new kid on the block. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Merge Labs exited stealth mode in mid-January with $252 million in funding from investors, including OpenAI. Altman, OpenAI's CEO, helped found Merge Labs, which aims to create widely accessible BCIs that are \"equal parts biology, device and AI.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Altman's role with Merge Labs set the stage for another rivalry in his long-standing feud with Musk, who helped found OpenAI but has soured on the company. Altman has also reportedly explored buying a rocket maker to compete with Musk's SpaceX. Musk, meanwhile, founded rival artificial-intelligence startup xAI and has taken OpenAI to court. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those U.S. tech big shots face increasing competition from overseas, particularly in China. According to Morgan Stanley, the Chinese government is expected to feature BCI technology prominently in its next five-year plan, set to be unveiled in March. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Inclusion in the plan would likely signal increased policy support, funding and commercialization pathways for BCI research and development over the next five years,\" analyst Adam Jonas said Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some of that support is already here. In December, China unveiled a 11.6 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) fund to support BCI companies. In August 2025, Chinese agencies revealed a plan to reach breakthroughs in \"core BCI technologies\" and build at least two globally competitive BCI firms over the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jonas noted that researchers at a Chinese university recently completed the first in-orbit test of a wireless BCI, collecting stable data under extreme conditions. China also has at least 20 BCI startups, 14 of which are funded, according to Tracxn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

In recent years, CPVC resin stability demands across the industry have increased. The LED chlorination upgrade represents a breakthrough, demonstrating significant improvements in thermal stability and energy efficiency, improving sustainable production. The process also provides operational benefits to customers, including enabling longer production runs with less down time, increasing formulation flexibility and supporting improved color performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“This technology represents a pivotal moment for our CPVC business,” said Griffin Rial, Vice President, Lubrizol TempRite. “LED chlorination allows us to deliver meaningful performance improvements—greater thermal stability, faster customer process times, and improved sustainability—while enabling new levels of operational flexibility across our global manufacturing network. The Louisville installation will bring lasting benefits to our customers and position Lubrizol for continued leadership in the CPVC industry.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Louisville installation serves as Lubrizol’s first for LED chlorination in CPVC resin production. The efficiency and performance gains will enable Lubrizol to flex production between making more products faster or enhancing stability as market needs evolve—further supporting growth in demanding applications and markets around the world. This innovative step lays the foundation for wider global adoption of LED chlorination technology across Lubrizol’s CPVC manufacturing footprint.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Lubrizol</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nLubrizol, a Berkshire Hathaway company, is a science-based company whose specialty chemistry delivers sustainable solutions to advance mobility, improve well-being and enhance modern life.

A new treatment from <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=84267847&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innovitalespa.com%2F&amp;a=InnoVitale+Spa\" tabindex=\"0\">InnoVitale Spa</a> is here to change that.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921528/LightGreenPrimary_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921528/LightGreenPrimary_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">InnoVitale Spa, a luxury day spa in St. Petersburg, Florida, has launched the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® - a proprietary, ten-step treatment developed specifically to address the dramatic skin changes caused by perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopausal. The facial is now available by appointment, and has already generated a growing waitlist.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A Widespread Problem the Beauty Industry Has Largely Ignored</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Declining estrogen doesn't just bring hot flashes and night sweats. It quietly dismantles the skin. Research shows that women lose nearly a third of their dermal collagen in the first five years after menopause, with collagen continuing to decline at roughly 2% per year for the following decade. The skin thins. Moisture vanishes. Elasticity disappears. Facial hair increases. Inflammation spikes. And yet, despite affecting every woman who lives past midlife, the issue gets almost no attention.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A large-scale global survey of more than 4,300 peri- and post-menopausal women, presented at the International Master Course on Aging Science World Congress in 2026, found that over 50% of women learned about menopause's impact on their skin only after experiencing it themselves. The three most commonly reported skin changes were lines and wrinkles (59%), loss of firmness and elasticity (58%), and increased dryness (56%). Beyond the physical toll, the survey found that 60% of women said these skin changes made them feel less attractive, 57% reported increased anxiety, and 55% felt less confident. (Read more about the Galderma Survey <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=3571775963&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.galderma.com%2Fnews%2Fgalderma-tackles-menopause-related-skin-changes&amp;a=HERE\" tabindex=\"0\">HERE</a> ) </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Perhaps most damning: a separate study found that almost one in two women was not aware that menopause affects the skin at all - and 61% said they felt insufficiently informed about menopause overall. Even among women who had discussed menopause with a doctor, more than a third still didn't know.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A Ten-Step Treatment Built on Personal Experience and Clinical Research</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Meno \"Pause\" Facial® was created by Sinead Norenius, founder and owner of <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=84267847&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innovitalespa.com%2F&amp;a=InnoVitale+Spa\" tabindex=\"0\">InnoVitale Spa</a> . Norenius began her career as a paramedical esthetician for a plastic and reconstructive surgeon in Southern California before going on to work with global brands including Yon-Ka Parisand St. Tropez Tan. In 2008, she founded Beautisol, a skincare company distributed on HSN and in spas and salons nationwide, and later launched iFabbo, an influencer marketing and technology platform. Both companies were subsequently acquired, and Norenius transitioned to the technology sector, where she served as a product management executive leading global development teams at billion-dollar SaaS companies.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Then menopause hit - early, and without warning. When Norenius entered perimenopause, she experienced the same confusion and isolation that millions of women describe: unexplained skin changes, a lack of useful clinical guidance, and the distinct sense that she was navigating something significant completely on her own. A subsequent Stage 2 malignant melanoma diagnosis deepened her commitment to developing solutions that genuinely serve women at this stage of life.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">\"The lack of public education and awareness around menopause is well-documented,\" said Norenius. \"For me, the experience was isolating. I didn't want other women to feel that way. I wanted to create something that actually worked and that treated women with the respect this transition deserves.\"</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The result is a comprehensive ten-step facial that targets the most common and disruptive menopausal skin concerns: severe dehydration, dryness, increased facial hair, loss of elasticity, dullness, and inflammation. The treatment addresses the specific questions women ask most: Why is my skin suddenly so dry? Why am I breaking out again in my 40s and 50s? Why does my skin look dull and lifeless? What can I actually do about the new facial hair?</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Where Traditional Technique s Meets FDA-Cleared Technology</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">What sets the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® apart from standard anti-aging treatments is its integration of Celluma® light therapy, an FDA-cleared red light therapy device. Celluma's technology delivers cellular repair, enhanced circulation, acne treatment, and reduced inflammation, addressing four of the most persistent and under-treated challenges of menopausal skin.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Red light therapy at this frequency targets the mitochondria in skin cells, stimulating ATP production and accelerating the repair processes that declining estrogen disrupts. For menopausal skin - which is simultaneously dealing with collagen loss, barrier dysfunction, increased sensitivity, and hormonal acne, this combination of hands-on expertise and science-backed technology represents a meaningful advance over single-approach treatments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Early Response: Five Stars and a Waitlist</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Since its introduction, the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® has generated five-star reviews and consistent demand that has already produced a waitlist. InnoVitale Spa has more than 250 five-star Google reviews overall, and the facial has become one of its most talked-about treatments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The response reflects a broader market reality. A 2024 Bonafide survey of more than 2,000 women found that 94% of US women reported receiving no education about menopause in school, and nearly half said they did not feel informed about it at all. More than 3 in 5 women said they are more likely to purchase from a brand that invests in menopause-related solutions. The Meno \"Pause\" Facial® is positioned squarely at the intersection of that unmet need and a growing willingness to seek out specialized care.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">St. Petersburg and Tampa Bay area women navigating perimenopause or menopause can now book the Meno \"Pause\" Facial® directly at <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628552-1&amp;h=1698881455&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.innovitalespa.com%2Ffacials-v2%2F&amp;a=InnoVitale+Spa\" tabindex=\"0\">InnoVitale Spa</a> .
