            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'After the divorce was finalized, he and his partner moved out of state to a place where there would be no child-support enforcement' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I feel disinclined to send money to someone who is essentially a stranger.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm looking for advice on my obligations to a parent who was not in my life starting at age 9 - there was no financial support or other contact - but who has initiated contact again now that I am in my 50s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My father left my mother with five young children on Christmas Eve in 1978. After the divorce was finalized, he and his partner moved out of state to a place where there would be no child-support enforcement. They did not have any children together. There was almost no contact for 42 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My mother did reach out when she remarried in 1981 because my stepdad wanted to adopt us. My father said no, which I now realize we could have challenged, but for me and my siblings, our stepdad became the person we considered our dad, so it wasn't very important to us to change our last name. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'There was almost no contact for 42 years.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several years ago, my father reached out after his wife passed away. He sent each of his five children $1,000 from his wife's life insurance and then a few hundred dollars more after he sold her car. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At that time, I told him I was not looking for a father-daughter relationship because I already had a dad, but I was willing to maintain some level of correspondence. For about a year, he sent cards, but over the last few years his interaction has decreased, which was not a surprise. However, I still receive emails from him from time to time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mention of money </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I have a legal and a moral question. Occasionally, he mentions his need for money. He has never directly asked for financial assistance, but he has shared some of the problems he has experienced. For example, he was defrauded and had to refinance his house after losing money. He has also had medical expenses, as he is now 83 and his health is declining. Recently, he told me that stairs have become difficult for him and that he would like to install a chair lift but cannot afford it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I am generally a compassionate person, so I sometimes wonder whether I should help him financially. While I would empty my savings for my mom (and would have done so for my stepdad, who has passed away), I feel disinclined to send money to someone who is essentially a stranger. He is not destitute: He owns his home and has relationships with his siblings and with some nieces and nephews. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I would empty my savings for my mom.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What I want to better understand is whether I have a legal obligation to provide support to this man, who is connected to me only through biology. I don't believe I do. Maryland (where I live) and South Carolina (where he lives) do not have filial-responsibility laws. However, does accepting money from his wife's life insurance create any obligations that would not otherwise exist? Does continuing to communicate with him create any obligation? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And finally, setting legal obligations aside, do I have a moral obligation to provide financial support to a man who did not provide food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, safety or emotional support during my childhood or throughout most of my adult life? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I wrestle with these questions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A Conflicted Daughter </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you give him one penny of your own money, it will open up a transactional codependence between you and this man, who is a virtual stranger. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Daughter, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That $1,000 gift was not free. It had strings attached. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He came back into your life in your 50s when his own wife died and he was on his own, emotionally and financially. I suspect the latter is where his focus lies. Given that he gave away $5,000 of his wife's life-insurance payout as gifts to his five children, we can assume that he received a substantial sum. That money either ran out due perhaps to home repairs and medical expenses, or he spent and invested it poorly. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What is clear: If he was in his 70s when he got back in touch with you, he has a very clear 360-degree view of his own long-term financial stability. He skipped town to avoid paying one red cent to your mother in child support, and now he's back. That $1,000 was an \"open-your-wallet\" gesture, designed to gain access. People in your life should make you feel safe, nourished and valued. Does he do that? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     South Carolina does not have filial-responsibility laws, and Maryland repealed its own law in 2017, meaning adult children are not responsible for their parents' debts or care-home costs, unless they sign as a guarantor. While some states still enforce these laws, they often include exceptions, including parental abandonment or failure to provide support, which would relieve the adult children of any liability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That $1,000 was an 'open-your-wallet' gesture to give him access. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This relationship ended at a time when you most needed him, as a child, and that 9-year-old child still exists today. She may still yearn for the approval, acknowledgement, attention and validation of her father, even if she received those things from her stepfather. Your father not only withheld that financial support and love and affection from your 9-year-old self, he also blocked the way for your stepfather to completely fulfill that role. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now that your stepfather is gone, it is of course too late for him to adopt you. But fatherhood, as you say, is about more than just biology. It's about the most valuable thing we give our loved ones during this short life: our time. Your father has never given you his time. He has only given you that $1,000 as an opening gambit, and now he wants something from you, but he is too Machiavellian to ask for it outright. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By leaving breadcrumbs for you in the form of hard-luck stories, he is manipulating you and using that 9-year-old child who he knows will always cry out with an open heart and open arms for the father who walked away, closing his wallet and his heart as he moved to another state. If you give him one penny of your own money, it will open up a transactional codependence between you and this man, who is a virtual stranger. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The $1,000 question </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have three choices. The first is to detach with love - that is, politely and kindly, and with no explanations or blame. That means telling him that you wish him well and bear him no ill will. You can gradually stop answering his emails and texts. That's your choice. He is the last person you owe an explanation. You can simply say: \"I need to take time for my family, my health and my life. I wish you well with everything.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Doing that may feel awkward because you accepted $1,000 from this man, your biological father. That's money in the bank in more ways than one, but primarily it gives him emotional and financial leverage. Your second choice is to detach with love and repay the $1,000, as he suggests he needs it more than you do. That way, you are not under obligation to him for anything, and you don't even have to answer his calls. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The third choice is to stay in contact - with or without repaying the $1,000 - and manage him as you would a busybody neighbor or annoying acquaintance who wants to be closer than you are. You don't have to answer every call or respond to every text. You are not a customer-service representative and you are no longer the little girl who needed a father. You are in your 50s and have other things to worry about. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I suggest you detach with love and repay the $1,000 he gave you. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So no, he is not your responsibility. You owe him nothing - legally, ethically or morally. Those ties were broken when he walked away and pulled up the drawbridge behind him. I don't know whether or not he is a narcissist, but from your retelling, he is someone who has always looked out for himself. He is in touch now because he needs something from you. He has nothing to bring to the table. It's likely too late for that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Legal and ethical issues are governed by standards set by society, but moral choices, for the most part, are for you alone to decide. I want you to make the choice for the right reason, not because you feel manipulated into giving money to a person who may not stop at one direct deposit and not because your 9-year-old self still craves the approval of the man who walked away and didn't look back all those years ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Be forewarned about the tools in a narcissist's playbook: Love bombing (giving you what they think you crave) and dry begging (dropping hints about what they need). And when they see you pulling away, be prepared for a complete change of personality (anger and rage and/or guilt-tripping and passive aggression). I am not diagnosing him or implying malicious intent, but I do believe you should be guarded. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Remember, your 9-year-old self already found her real father: your stepdad. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Can I stop my kids from using their inheritance to support political causes I vehemently oppose? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My wife's credit-card payment is three months overdue.

I empathize because I'm in the exact same position, and I am also in my 70s or thereabouts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I've owned my own company for the last 15 years. It's worth $8.5 million, with a portfolio of just under $5 million. More, more, more - and I've never cared less about that stuff. At the same time, I've never worked harder, and I've never had so much fun. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of my associates, with whom I've become very close, has analyzed my situation. He told me that I could certainly retire. Thus, I now consider myself to be working in my \"retirement job,\" under the assumption that if you can retire but you're still working, then it is your retirement job. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'My wife suggested taking one week off each month.' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taking Fridays off didn't work. I also tried shortening my days to seven hours instead of 10. But since I come in between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., that didn't work either, because people want to speak with me from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My wife suggested a \"glide week\" - taking one week off each month to go somewhere. I am anxiously awaiting my third one in March.

He replied, \"The vacuum\" - the gaping void where his career used to be. I've already used that line to describe to others what I fear about retirement. That answer really has an impact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I enjoy reading your column every day.

It might be the work itself, the chance to solve problems, the clients or customers who you help, the coworkers or, for those who are fortunate enough to work remotely, the flexibility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whatever your career, whether you're playing the piano at Lincoln Center, working as a dental assistant or sitting in an office figuring out how to solve a problem, enjoying what you do makes it easier to keep going, if you want to or - like millions of people - you need to keep working past 65. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But for people who have physically demanding jobs - in factories, retail stores or public transportation, for instance - the workplace camaraderie, the knowledge that they're doing something worthwhile and the privilege of having a job is often not enough. Working past retirement age is not always an option. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People retire due to financial stability and/or disability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Studies on America's \"unretirement\" rates bear this out, at least for those who return to work. Some 7% of older Americans surveyed by AARP in late 2025 reported returning to the labor market within the past six months. The reasons included financial necessity (48% of those polled), boredom (15%) and a desire to help others (14%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, the most common reasons for retiring, according to AARP, were financial stability (22%) and, unfortunately, a health problem or disability (21%). Financial readiness, including Social Security and pension benefits, is the reason behind roughly half of retirements (50%). Most retirees believe they retired at the right time (68%), while 28% say they retired too early. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Let me tell you a story. I recently had lunch with a friend in New York who is turning 80 this summer. He's a therapist who works three days a week out of an office and also does some online sessions. He goes away every weekend of the summer, from Friday to Monday. He's read \"Ulysses\" four times, but that's beside the point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What is a weekend? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While he appreciates his long weekends, he still loves his work for many reasons. It gets him out of bed and gives structure to his week. And over the 40 years he's been a therapist, he has made a difference in many people's lives. He has some clients who have been with him nearly all of that time. He has told them that when he decides to retire, he would give them a year's notice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So why is he finally retiring? For a few reasons. He wants to be able to travel more. He's never been to Copenhagen, for example, or some other European cities. Having no work responsibilities will finally enable him to make those trips. And he does not want to leave his clients high and dry should he die unexpectedly. \"That wouldn't be fair,\" he told me. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While he is retiring in part out of responsibility to his clients, this letter writer, a business owner like yourself, feels he must continue working out of duty to his 48 employees. I admire his sense of commitment, but he should not be held hostage by his success. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Everyone deserves to retire after 40-plus years of hard work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I love your wife's \"glide week\" suggestion, and I equally love that you can't wait for the next one. This may be how you continue for years to come, or it could become your first taste of full-time retirement, easing you out of a busier schedule and into a fulfilling, adventurous life - and not into the vacuum feared by that person interviewed in the Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your clients are obviously very lucky to have an investment manager who not only wants to stay in touch and build the best possible portfolios for his clients, but also loves what he does. Customers and coworkers can sense whether you like your job, and they respond accordingly. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your company is worth millions, so you have the luxury of choice, something you are acutely and, it seems, gratefully aware of.

For WELIREG plus LENVIMA, the median PFS was 14.8 months (95% CI, 11.2-16.6) versus 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.2-11.1) for cabozantinib. A trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), the trial’s other primary endpoint, was also observed for WELIREG plus LENVIMA (HR=0.85 [95% CI, 0.68-1.05]; p=0.06075). The median OS was 34.9 months (95% CI, 27.5-NR) for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus 27.6 months (95% CI, 24.0-31.4) for cabozantinib.

So far this year, the stock has edged up 0.5% to match the S&amp;P 500's performance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following are some key insights from Abel's letter to shareholders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investments in Japan are as important as U.S. holdings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel noted that a large portion of Berkshire's equity investments are held in a small number of U.S. companies, notably investments in Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and Moody's (MCO). The total market value of those holdings was $158.6 billion as of Dec. 31. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long-term economic prospects,\" Abel wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The same methodology in choosing investments in American companies is used in finding opportunities in Japan, \"which we view as comparable to our major U.S. holdings in importance and long-term value-creation opportunity.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The largest Japan holdings, with a total market value of $35.37 billion, are Mitsubishi (JP: 8058), Itochu (JP: 8001), Mitsui &amp; Co. (MITSY), Marubeni (MARUY) and Sumitomo (SSUMY). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earnings fall for the quarter and year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Net income in the latest quarter fell 2.5% from the same period a year ago to $19.2 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Operating earnings, which exclude investment gains and other nonrecurring items, declined 29.8% to $10.2 billion for the quarter, and were down 6.2% for the year to $44.5 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel noted, however, that while 2025 earnings showed a decline, they were above the $37.5 billion in earnings Berkshire has averaged over the past five years, which he said underscores the durability of Berkshire's operating business, while also showing there's room for improvement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buffett remains a fixture at the office </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's how Abel's first shareholder letter started: \"Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He said, however, that Buffett shouldn't be viewed solely as an investment guru. What will endure, according to his successor as CEO, is how he ran his businesses, and how he treated shareholders as partners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Buffett may no longer be running the business, but Abel reminded shareholders that Buffett will still be in the office \"five days a week\" as chairman, and will continue to have a say in which stocks Berkshire buys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Uncontrolled proliferation and activation of mast cells result in chronic, severe and often unpredictable symptoms across multiple organ systems. The vast majority of those affected have indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). Despite treatment with multiple symptom-directed therapies, patients with ISM frequently experience persistent symptoms including anaphylaxis, maculopapular rash, pruritus, diarrhea, brain fog, fatigue and bone pain, as well as long-term health complications such as osteoporosis. This burden of disease can lead to a profound, negative impact on quality of life. Patients often live in fear of severe, unexpected symptoms, have limited ability to work or perform daily activities, and isolate themselves to protect against unpredictable triggers. There were no approved therapies for ISM until 2023, when AYVAKIT received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this indication.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A minority of patients have advanced SM, which encompasses a group of high-risk SM subtypes including aggressive SM (ASM), SM with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL). In addition to mast cell activation symptoms, advanced SM is associated with organ damage due to mast cell infiltration – including bone lesions, malabsorption, liver dysfunction and bone marrow failure – as well as poor overall survival.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Blueprint Medicines' Clinical Studies in SM</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Blueprint Medicines has pursued a broad development program for patients living with SM, including three registrational clinical studies for AYVAKIT and one for elenestinib.
