(“Portfolio”) has reached an agreement to be acquired by Protective Life Insurance Company (“Protective Life”), the principal subsidiary of Protective Life Corporation (“Protective”), a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc.

The term only came up once on the company's prior earnings call, and there were scattered instances before that as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fungibility refers to the idea of being replaceable and interchangeable. In Microsoft's case, the company seemed to be referring to \"fungible\" infrastructure that can serve broad-based needs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While some on Wall Street are worried that Microsoft is overbuilding to meet the demands of a small set of high-profile AI companies, like OpenAI, that have uncertain financial futures, Microsoft's management sees its work as much broader than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Why Microsoft's stock is falling in the face of upbeat earnings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In response to an analyst's question about how the company makes sure it isn't overbuilding, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said Microsoft focuses on efficiencies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You have to start with building out a very fungible fleet,\" he said on the call. \"It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training,\" a reference to different types of AI workloads. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The term applies not just to the functional aspects of Microsoft's cloud business but also to the sorts of customers the company serves, according to Nadella. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You don't want to build for a digital native ... as if you're just doing hosting for them,\" he said. By being \"fungible,\" Microsoft lays the groundwork to \"ensure the build is for the broad customer base.\" The company sees broadening interest in AI services as enterprise companies are still early in their adoption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts noted the heavy use of the word, with mixed views. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Management spoke a lot of 'fungible' capacity, which seems to mean Azure can satisfy the demands for different kinds of Public Cloud workloads, which is probably true, but management's commentary causes us to question the company's ability to realize comfortable profitability in AI training, something we're confident that Oracle can achieve,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note titled: \"Fungible Quarter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey said Microsoft \"highlighted its fungible fleet that can be used across the AI lifecycle, be continuously modernized, and used across the company's platform of services.\" He noted that Microsoft has been using software to make its hardware more efficient. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft executives made their comments while also talking up plans for enhanced capital-spending growth this year. Whereas Microsoft previously projected a lower capex growth rate this fiscal year than last fiscal year, CFO Amy Hood said on Wednesday that she now expects this year's rate to be higher, in pursuit of \"accelerating demand.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft spent $34.9 billion on capex in the fiscal first quarter, more than $10 billion above what analysts were expecting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Meta's stock slides toward its worst day in years as Wall Street pans 'runaway' AI spending </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
