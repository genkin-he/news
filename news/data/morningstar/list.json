            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Quest Insurance Group Limited</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best </strong>has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of B (Fair) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “bb+” (Fair) of Quest Insurance Group Limited (Quest) (New Zealand). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Quest’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as adequate, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings also factor in the neutral impact from the company’s ultimate majority shareholder, Federal Pacific Group Limited.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nQuest’s balance sheet strength assessment is underpinned by its risk-adjusted capitalisation, which was at the very strong level as of fiscal year-end (31 March) 2025, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Prospectively, AM Best expects the company’s risk-adjusted capitalisation to remain at least at the strong level, supported by internal capital generation. AM Best still expects the company’s regulatory solvency position to remain appropriate, supported by prudent capital management. Offsetting balance sheet strength factors include the company’s small absolute capital base of NZD 21.8 million, which increases the sensitivity of the risk-adjusted capitalisation to stress scenarios, such as outsized dividend payments or fluctuations in prospective performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses Quest’s operating performance as adequate, supported by its robust underwriting performance and positive investment returns. In fiscal year 2025, the company reported a combined ratio (net/net, IFRS 17) of 89.5% and a return-on-equity ratio of 23.6%. Quest’s investment income remains a stable contributor to its overall profits, with the company reporting a net investment yield (including gains/losses) of 4.5% in fiscal year 2025. AM Best expects prospective performance to remain supportive of the adequate assessment over the near term, although the company’s rapid business growth and risk profile changes could drive potential volatility.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nQuest’s business profile assessment of limited reflects its small market presence, geographic concentration and relatively niche product offering, largely as a provider of comprehensive vehicle insurance (CVI) and mechanical breakdown insurance (MBI) in New Zealand. The company’s scale of operation has increased significantly over the last five years, driven mostly by its third-party distributor of motor-related insurance. AM Best notes that Quest’s reliance on its third-party distributor has increased in recent years, with the related distribution channel accounting for over two-thirds of the gross premiums in fiscal-year 2025.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses Quest’s ERM as appropriate given the current size and complexity of its operations. Nonetheless, AM Best expects continual development of Quest’s ERM capabilities to support its growing operations and risk profile. Following the conclusion of a recent regulatory investigation, Quest was issued a formal warning letter over potential contraventions of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010, with no penalties imposed. The company has since engaged in a process to strengthen its risk management capabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Otter Tail Power Company Requests Minnesota Rate Increase</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOtter Tail Power Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Otter Tail Corporation (Nasdaq: OTTR), filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to increase electric rates for its Minnesota customers. This request initiates an 18- to 24-month review process during which the PUC evaluates the company’s costs for providing electric service and then sets rates in a manner the PUC deems reasonable for both the company providing the service and the customers who depend on it.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our customers, employees, friends, and neighbors see the costs of goods and services going up all around us, and we know that’s not easy,” said Otter Tail Power President Tim Rogelstad. “We’ve taken a hard look at our operations to manage expenses and improve efficiency before asking our customers to pay more. This request reflects what’s necessary to continue delivering the dependable service our communities count on.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs part of the state regulatory process, Otter Tail Power requested PUC permission to increase rates on an interim basis beginning January 1, 2026. If the PUC approves this request, the overall interim bill increase of approximately 12.6% remains in place until the PUC completes its highly structured review designed to balance public interest, utility viability, and legal rigor. During this 18- to 24-month interim period, a typical residential customer’s bill would increase approximately $13.15 a month; a typical business customer’s bill would increase approximately $43.67 a month. Each customer’s interim increase will be different based on the rates they’re on and how much energy they use.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe company anticipates the PUC will make its final rate decision in the first quarter of 2027; final rates likely will not impact customers’ bills until the second or third quarter of 2027.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIf the PUC approves Otter Tail Power’s final rate request as filed, the net increase over what customers pay today would be approximately $44.8 million, or 17.7%. A typical residential customer’s bill would increase approximately $18.14 a month; a typical business customer’s bill would increase approximately $73.20 a month. As with interim rates, each customer’s final increase will be different based on the rates they’re on and how much energy they use. If final rates are lower than interim rates, customers will receive refunds with interest. If final rates are higher, the company won’t collect the difference.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">What customers see in return for this rate increase</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAccording to Rogelstad, while inflation is one of the primary drivers behind this request, customers benefit from infrastructure investments that support immediate and long-term reliability; grid resilience efforts that reduce, and potentially prevent, service disruptions; and the transition to renewable resources.\n\n</p><ol class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--ordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Infrastructure investments.</strong> To support immediate and long-term reliability, Otter Tail Power is investing in the infrastructure that moves electricity to homes and businesses. For example, the company is extending the life of aging infrastructure by replacing cross arms, poles, and insulators that have been in place for 50+ years, as well as adding new infrastructure.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Grid resilience.</strong> Grid resilience efforts include expanding underground lines, now covering 28% of the company’s distribution system, to reduce exposure to storms and improve reliability. The company also is increasing vegetation management near power lines to prevent service disruptions.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Energy transition. </strong>Otter Tail Power is transitioning to a larger percentage of renewable energy generation resources for Minnesota customers. These zero-fuel-cost resources, along with tax credits, have helped ease the transition. The company is including in this request the costs associated with no longer serving Minnesota customers with power from its co-owned, coal-fired Coyote Station in North Dakota by the end of 2031.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Inflation. </strong>Otter Tail Power’s last Minnesota rate review was based on the cost of doing business in 2021. Since then, inflation has increased the cost of materials, and the labor and equipment needed to build and maintain the electric grid. According to Rogelstad, the company is managing these impacts through smart planning and efficient operations, but the cost of providing service is more than it can recover through current rates.\n\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“We understand rising electric costs are challenging for our customers,” said Rogelstad. “We also take very seriously our wholehearted commitment, and our regulatory obligation, to reliably serve those customers. This request is not being driven by data centers, despite what some national headlines might suggest. We would not ask for this rate increase if it didn’t reflect the real costs of maintaining and strengthening our electric system.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAccording to Rogelstad, even with this increase Otter Tail Power customers will keep paying less for the energy they need to power their homes and businesses than they would almost anywhere else in the region. “While this is an impressive statement, we aren’t competing against our neighbor’s rates. We’re competing against our own,” said Rogelstad. “Our ability to keep our rates among the lowest in the region demonstrates our tradition of working hard for the economic viability of our customers and communities, and we’ll keep that tradition going.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nExcept for historical information contained here, the statements in this release are forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Exxon and Chevron are slated to report earnings on Friday, after a string of upbeat quarters for the two integrated giants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling oil prices continued to hurt earnings for both Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp., but both oil giants beat Wall Street's profit expectations on Friday as they boosted production to record levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The companies also pleased investors by generating more cash from operations and increasing shareholder returns, with Exxon Mobil raising its quarterly dividend by 4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon is \"a focused, disciplined machine,\" with its holdings in Guyana and West Texas' Permian basin, plus its liquified natural gas business, its top  growth drivers, Melius Research analyst James West said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon's production increased 2.9% to 4.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, including record quarterly production in both the Permian and Guyana. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company raised its dividend to $1.04 a share, from 99 cents a share. At Thursday's closing price of $114.69, that would lift the implied dividend yield to 3.63%, which is more than triple the implied yield for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX of 1.15%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon's net income fell 12.3% to $7.55 billion, while adjusted EPS fell to $1.88 to $1.92 but beat the FactSet consensus of $1.82. The adjusted EPS has now declined for five straight quarters and beat expectations for six straight.  Revenue declined 5.2% to $85.29 billion, missing expectations of $86.47 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An oil glut looms </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron's third-quarter earnings were \"predictably messy\" given the recent Hess acquisition and consolidation, Citi analyst Alastair Syme said. The company presented a better earnings picture than the market had anticipated, however, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are \"encouraging signs of growth,\" and a financial framework that looks \"reasonably well adjusted to a potentially lower oil macro in 2026,\" Syme said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Exxon and Chevron's results come as U.S. oil futures prices (CL.1) have shed 3.2% so far this month, and have fallen 15.8% year to date. There are plenty of worries that oil prices may be headed to their lowest since the pandemic. A World Bank report this week pointed to an oil-supply glut brewing for next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron's  worldwide production rose 21% from a year ago, with U.S. production up 27% to hit new company records, it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the U.S., net oil-equivalent production increased by 435,000 barrels per day to 2.04 million barrels per day, helped by the Hess acquisition and higher production in the Permian Basin and the Gulf of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron kept its quarterly dividend at $1.71 per share, implying a dividend yield of 4.46%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For earnings, Chevron's net income fell 21.1% to $3.54 billion, while adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, of $1.85 were down from $2.51, but beat the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of $1.71. Revenue dropped 2% to $49.73 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $47.23 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron said adjusted free cash flow increased more than 50% to $7 billion, while Exxon said cash flow from operating activities rose 28% to $14.8 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron increased its shareholder returns to $6 billion from $5.5 billion in the previous quarter, while Exxon lifted shareholder returns to $9.4 billion from $9.2 billion, and raised its quarterly dividend to $1.03 a share from 99 cents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The companies' stocks diverged on Friday, with Exxon shares down nearly 1% and Chevron shares gaining more than 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chevron's results marked the 10th straight quarter that adjusted EPS saw a year-over-year decline, but the third straight quarter that the company beat expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The integrated giants are not the same companies they were a decade ago, with management that is more disciplined and shying away from boom-and-bust cycles, said Morningstar analyst Allen Good. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They have improved their balance sheet and shown capital discipline,\" he said. \"They are still showing relatively strong returns and balance sheets, and they are not overextended.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Their stock trajectories this year seem to support that distinction. Exxon shares are holding on to a 6.6% gain so far in 2025 through Thursday, while Chevron shares are up 6%. However, they have underperformed the broader equity market, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX gaining 16% so far this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Claudia Assis -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(EIS) (Italy), a captive of Eni S.p.A. (Eni), a multinational energy company based in Italy. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect EIS’ balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best expects EIS’ risk-adjusted capitalisation to be maintained with a comfortable buffer at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). An offsetting rating factor in the balance sheet strength assessment is EIS’ reliance on reinsurance to underwrite large risks; however, the risks associated with this reliance are mitigated by long-standing relationships with reinsurers of excellent credit quality.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nEIS’ prospective performance is expected to be strong, in line with the historical performance of Eni Insurance Designated Activity Company (EID), evidenced by a five-year weighted average combined ratio of 42.7% (2020-2024), as calculated by AM Best. Prospective performance is subject to volatility due to potential large losses from the property account. However, underwriting volatility on a net basis should be moderated by the captive’s comprehensive reinsurance programme.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs a single-parent captive, EIS is well-integrated within Eni’s risk management framework and maintains its active role in overseeing and containing the group’s insurance costs. Additionally, the captive enables the group to centralise claims information and establish effective internal reporting for Eni. On 1 February 2025, Eni’s former captive, EID, transferred its assets and liabilities to EIS, through a cross-border merger operation, with the latter becoming the new captive insurer of Eni.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Morey Stettner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taxes, investments, healthcare - everything adds up. Here's how to plan now to relocate later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The financial planning strategies you followed in America may no longer work as intended after you relocate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide to retire abroad, impulsivity works against you. Abruptly uprooting your life can expose you to financial (and emotional) shocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's better to plan ahead. \"People underestimate all the pieces that come into play,\" said Brett Bernstein, a certified financial planner in Bethesda, Md. \"The goal is to make sure they have the income they want to live off of.\" That takes months, even years, of research and preparation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Start early in figuring out where to go. Visit your top-tier destinations and consider the impact of inflation and taxes in those countries. \"Identify the income-tax rules in the country and in the local province where you might move,\" Bernstein said. \"What's the local sales tax? What other taxes are there?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From his experience advising clients who retire abroad, some Americans assume \"it'll be cheaper to live over there.\" The figure they can sell their U.S. house at a big profit, rent abroad and live happily ever after. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The challenge is accurately projecting the cost of living, especially nondiscretionary expenses (rent, taxes, insurance, etc.) in a new home. Advisers often use financial-planning software to map out scenarios that include currency swings, taxes and investment options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After deciding on a foreign destination, it's best to hire an international-tax adviser who specializes in tax laws in that country. Relocation consultants or attorneys can also help anticipate and address legal and logistical issues. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Portfolio shifts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Managing long-term currency risk plays a key role. Unfavorable exchange rates can erode spending power in the years after a move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Similarly, it's good to diversify investment portfolios to include stocks and bonds issued in the future home country. That's vital if it's a permanent move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Having international diversification in place is important,\" said Shane Cummings, a Denver-based certified financial planner. \"Beyond that, the most important thing you can do before moving abroad is to look into tax implications because [foreign] tax treaties can be complex. On the investment side, portfolio income can be taxed differently and that can lead you to make investment changes now.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Financial-planning strategies that worked in America may no longer work as intended after relocation. For example, some countries tax distributions from a Roth IRA - as well as taxing other sources of income from the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While planning well in advance of a move makes sense, risks abound. A stable country can be rocked by political instability. American retirees can quickly find themselves on the outside looking in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Don't assume today's dream destination will welcome Americans well into the future,\" said David A. Schneider, a New York City-based certified financial planner. \"There's a risk of backlash if lots of Americans stream into that country.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spain and Portugal, for instance, remain popular choices for American retirees. But their residency and language requirements are tightening up, along with property-investment restrictions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may be necessary to sever ties to well-liked financial advisers or brokerage accounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you become a permanent resident abroad, you'll need to find new financial [institutions] to work with you because the U.S. financial system will largely be cut off from you, even if the country is a strong U.S. ally,\" Schneider said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. financial custodians, such as banks and brokerages, have strict rules about continuing to serve Americans who relocate abroad. Increasingly, they are terminating accounts once they learn an American customer has left the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Your ability to invest in the U.S. can end without a legal U.S. address,\" said Mike Delgass, a New York City-based adviser. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare concerns </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n      If you move abroad, you will lose almost all your Medicare coverage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare is another factor that can affect a retiree's nest egg. Retirees abroad will lose almost all Medicare coverage. \"So you need to figure out how you'll fund healthcare in that country,\" Delgass said. \"It's a new expense for retirees to plan for. You may need private-pay or supplemental [health] insurance. Some countries subsidize it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And for those indecisive or prone to changing minds at the last minute, retiring abroad gets tougher and potentially more costly.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     State jobless claims point to a soft-but-stable labor market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S.-based online retailing giant Amazon said it is eliminating 14,000 jobs to streamline its operations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon's plans to discard at least 14,000 employees and the elimination of 48,000 jobs at UPS suggest layoffs in the U.S. are on the rise, but there's just one problem: There's little evidence to support it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A spate of high-profile corporate layoff announcements in recent days has sparked talk on whether the end of the \"low-fire, low-hire\" labor market is here. If so, it could be an ominous sign for the U.S. economy, which has been made more vulnerable due to trade wars and a government shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Normally, economists would verify their suspicions through the weekly jobless claims report, which shows how many people apply for unemployment benefits. They'd also look at a monthly report on total layoffs. Both reports have been suspended during the federal lockdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a backdoor route to detecting changes in layoff trends, though. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The data on unemployment filings compiled by the states are not just sent to the federal government. They are also available on nearly all the state-government websites with a short delay. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What have they shown? The number of new jobless claims remains in the low 200,000s, and they haven't really changed since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the seven days ending Oct. 25, U.S. jobless claims were at an estimated 220,000 after seasonal adjustments, according to calculations by Citi Research. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Initial jobless claims totaled 218,000 in the week before the shutdown began, Wall Street DJIA SPX firms estimate based on state data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Jobless claims data continue to point to the low firing and low hiring dynamic persisting in the labor market in October,\" Citi economists wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A look at some of the largest states also suggests the labor market is stable. New jobless claims in California, for instance, totaled 40,731 last week - basically unchanged since the start of the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If scores of big companies made large layoffs announcements like Amazon (AMZN) or UPS (UPS), the outlook for the labor market could darken. But it really hasn't been the case. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Despite some recent high-profile layoff announcements, initial claims for now remain consistent with a low pace of job losses,\" said Nancy Van Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's also important to consider is how many layoffs take place each year in a gigantic economy like the United States. The Amazon and UPS job reductions, as large as they seem, would barely make a dent in jobless claims. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consider that some 11.5 million new jobless claims were filed in 2024. The job cuts by Amazon and UPS would amount to just 0.6 percentage points of all layoffs last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jobless claims don't even reveal the full scope of the rapid churn in the U.S. labor market. Many people who lose jobs don't apply for benefits, either because they might not be eligible or because they find a new job quickly. Some might also decide to retire or stay out of the workforce. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More broadly, layoffs in the U.S. topped 19.2 million in 2024, based on another government report on job openings and job losses. Most of the people who lost jobs ended up working somewhere else. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The job cuts at Amazon and UPS also have to be put into context. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon, for instance, also reduced its workforce by 27,000 employees in 2022 - but those layoffs didn't make a dent in weekly jobless claims. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How come? The layoffs were spread out, for one thing, and many former employees quickly found work at a time when demand for labor was high and the unemployment rate was at a 55-year low of 3.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The UPS job cuts, for their part, actually started early this year. Some 34,000 of the 48,000 layoffs have already taken place and would have been counted in weekly jobless-claims reports before the shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So the labor market is just fine, then?  Not necessarily. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The recent layoff announcements could be the tip of the iceberg. Job creation in the U.S. has also nearly ground to a halt since the spring, and many companies have said they plan to scale back hiring plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If the economy were to slow even further, businesses could lay off more workers to offset a decline in sales and profits. Companies could also try to save on tariff costs by reducing labor expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But for now, there's still no sign of a major surge in layoffs or a rapid rise in unemployment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
