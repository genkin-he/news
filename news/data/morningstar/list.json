The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimate is February 26, 2025.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this MRE are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral Resources as Indicated or Measured Mineral Resources. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">3. Estimation domains were built from geological data with the exception of high-grade domains which were constrained using grade thresholds based on statistical analysis of the core assays.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">4.

Geological and block models for the MRE used data from a total of 23 surface drill holes, completed by EV Nickel in 2025. The drill hole database was validated prior to resource estimation and QA/QC checks were made using industry-standard control charts for blanks, core duplicates and commercial certified reference material inserted into assay batches by EV Nickel and by comparison of umpire assays performed at a second laboratory.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">6. Estimates have been rounded to two significant figures.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">7.

A 10 m x 10 m x 10 m block model was created, and samples were composited at 1.5 m intervals.

More broadly, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX fell 0.5% to snap back-to-back gains, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped a sharp 1.2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia is \"a big heavyweight\" in the S&amp;P 500 at around 8% of the index, so when it drops, it hurts the U.S. equities benchmark, according to Katie Stockton, a chartered market technician and founder of research firm Fairlead Strategies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's earnings results also didn't assuage the stock market's broader concerns about Big Tech's tremendous spending on artificial intelligence, with investors anxious about how much megacap companies are raising their capital-expenditure budgets on AI and the uncertainty about the return on that investment further down the road, according to Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech held back gains for the S&amp;P 500, making it difficult for the index to advance Thursday, even as other parts of the market broadly climbed, Gordon said in a phone interview. \"This is just how the index math haunts you.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can look across the board on solid results, but I think it's become the new normal in terms of this pushback on a lot of the spending on AI,\" said Gordon. Investors remain worried about whether Big Tech valuations are inflated relative to \"what they're actually worth,\" he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Nvidia is the biggest weight in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index NDX QQQ, with its massive market value having the heft to move the market and influence sentiment, Stockton at Fairlead Strategies said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors had run up Nvidia's stock in the lead-up to its highly anticipated earnings report released after the stock market's closing bell Wednesday, said Stockton. \"From a sentiment perspective,\" expectations on the part of investors were \"clearly quite high.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market sentiment surrounding AI and Big Tech soured Thursday, with shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) also seeing a sharp selloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Blips\" higher in the S&amp;P 500's tech sector XX:SP500.45 \"aren't being maintained,\" cautioned Stockton. \"If we lose market breadth\" and Big Tech stocks aren't there \"to pick up the slack,\" that would be \"problematic\" for the S&amp;P 500, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Nvidia \"delivered another stellar set of results that make the extraordinary seem ordinary,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note Wednesday. But \"given the material upward revisions in hyperscale capex expectations over the last five weeks, investor expectations were likely elevated coming into the print.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech selloff </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS - an exchange-traded fund that holds Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet, Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) - fell 1.6% on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Nvidia dropped 5.5%, snapping a four-day winning streak and leaving the company with a market value of $4.49 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That company was the worst performer in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, with Meta and Microsoft the only two stocks held by the fund that ended the day's trading in positive territory, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors on Thursday also were weighing earnings reports from software companies Salesforce (CRM) and Snowflake (SNOW), which both closed sharply higher Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The software sector broadly outperformed semiconductor stocks, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV gaining 2.2%, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX dropped 3%, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But an upbeat day for software stocks and other areas of the S&amp;P 500 weren't enough to offset the damage from Big Tech. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three sectors in which Big Tech resides, including information technology, communication services XX:SP500.50 and communication discretionary XX:SP500.25, make up 55% of the S&amp;P 500, said Gordon. That left the S&amp;P 500 down Thursday, even as the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP - which equally weighs stocks in the index - finished the day with a 0.6% gain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Christine Idzelis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The goal of this program was to target unsampled intervals above and below historical assay intervals that report high-grade zones. Sampling of the historical drill core is expected to allow the Company to evaluate whether disseminated mineralization halos exist and to assess their spatial relationship to mapped electromagnetic conductors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Results from the re-sampling work confirmed that massive sulfide veins occur within broader disseminated halos extending over substantial downhole lengths (Table 1).

The Table of results shown below reflects significant intervals of mineralization in the core that integrates both the historical assay results with the new assay intervals completed by the Company (Table 2). This reflects a more complete picture of the extent and tenor of mineralization the historical drillhole dataset.

Historical drill holes that are observed to have strong Cu-Ni-PGM mineralization are spatially correlated with mapped electromagnetic conductors (show as red lines on Figure 2). Where historical drill holes were observed to have modest Cu-Ni-PGMM mineralization, they are not spatially coincident with the electromagnetic conductors. Future exploration plans will focus on testing electromagnetic conductor trends and step-out targets between and beyond historic core holes.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">District Context</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mineralization at Skibo occurs along the basal contact of the Duluth Complex, a geological setting that hosts several copper-nickel deposits in Minnesota.
