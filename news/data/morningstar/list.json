            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano sold his Fiserv shares for at least $500 million. The stock fell 44% on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Frank Bisignano, in matching wardrobe, looks on as Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office in August. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The crisis swamping Fiserv should raise fresh questions about Donald Trump's Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was running the payments company until just a few months ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fiserv's stock (FI) immediately collapsed by more than 40% early Wednesday as the company's new leaders shocked Wall Street with news of a plummeting financial outlook and past management errors and ended the day down 44%. CEO Mike Lyons, who took over from Bisignano in May, delivered before analysts and investors a brutal takedown of the Milwaukee-based company's failings under the leadership of the man now in charge of Social Security. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bisignano was the CEO of Fiserv for five years, from 2020 to this year, and chairman, as well, for the past three. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sales forecasts made in recent years \"would have been objectively difficult to achieve even with the right investment and strong execution,\" Lyons told analysts and investors Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation: Under Bisignano, the company made forecasts it could not plausibly have achieved. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Management made \"decisions to defer certain investments and cut certain costs [which] improved margins in the short term but are now limiting our ability to serve clients in a world-class way, execute product launches to our standards and grow revenue to our full potential.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation: Bisignano relied on short-term cost cutting, to the detriment of the company's long-term health. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And, in recent years, quarterly earnings results \"increasingly relied on short-term initiatives,\" said Lyons, who joined Fiserv as CEO-in-waiting in January from PNC, where he'd been president since 2024. Those initiatives, Lyons said, placed \"too much emphasis on pursuing in-quarter results as opposed to building long-term relationships by prioritizing business that both meets our clients' needs and comes with high recurring revenue.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation: Bisignano was chasing short-term quarterly results, not building the business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oh, and Lyons pointedly promised the Street that Fiserv was now \"on our way back to the highest standards.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation? You got it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not unusual for a new boss to blame the old boss for lingering problems. But in the case of Firserv, the stock is now down 64% in 2025, and Lyons became CEO five months in. Something was obviously wrong at the company before he took over. The stock is changing hands for less today than what it was worth when Bisignano became CEO in 2000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The revelations, especially on costs, may cause America's seniors some unease. Trump put Bisignano in charge of the Social Security Administration in May, tasking him with \"turning it around.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This guy's amazing,\" Trump said of Bisignano in August during an Oval Office press conference. \"It's sort of what he does. He takes troubled entities and turns them around.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The president added, \"He did some of the biggest messes in the world.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those now nursing massive losses on Fiserv's stock may ruefully agree, although the president presumably meant listeners to understand Bisignano as having fixed messes rather than having created them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Social Security chief tapped to oversee another struggling agency: the IRS </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While investors and analysts will debate the current situation at Fiserv and may not agree on whom to blame, crises of this scale rarely come out of nowhere. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before leaving the company in May to join the administration, as recently as February, Bisignano was bragging to Wall Street investors about the company's stellar performance and its great outlook. The stock price back then was $230. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now? $70.60. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They say it's better to be lucky than to be smart, and cynics may now wonder which word is a better fit for Bisignano. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The latest: Fiserv attracted hot money ahead of 44% stock-price nosedive </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He didn't just get out of Fiserv before the collapse. He also sold all of his stock before the price plunged. And he was able to use a government loophole that has allowed him to avoid capital-gains tax on those stock sales, potentially forever. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lucky? Smart? You make the call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Joining the administration legally required (or, a cynic might say, enabled) Bisignano - seconded just this month to a newly created CEO post at the IRS - to dump all of his stock quickly to comply with ethics rules and without alarming the Street. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As of Feb. 28 of this year, Bisignano owned in total 3,176,650 shares, according to securities filings. He sold between mid-May and early July, his government ethics filings show. During that time the price ranged between $157.57 and $177.36, according to MarketWach data. That means that Bisignano, a Trump campaign backer, sold the shares for at least $500 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Today, at a share price below $71, they'd be worth $225 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The difference (that is, the avoided loss of value): at least $275 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to the company's proxy statement, Bisignano also held nearly 400,000 \"unvested stock units,\" potentially worth up to $70 million more at the May and June stock prices, though it is unclear which, if any, he received before leaving the company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Government ethics filings don't show exactly how much appointees raise when they sell their stocks. Instead they give ranges. The filings show 22 separate transactions between May 16 and July 1, with a range of between $240 million and $610 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ordinarily when you sell stock for millions, let alone hundreds of millions, you are expected to pay capital-gains tax on the profits at a rate of up to 20% for long-term holdings (with short-term holdings taxed at ordinary marginal income-tax rates). A $500 million sale of long-term holdings would result in a tax bill of up to $100 million, depending on how much you paid for the stock in the first place. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But under a law signed by the first President George Bush, executives who join an administration and who are required to sell their stock to avoid conflicts of interest get a freebie. They can sell their stock and defer capital-gains tax, potentially forever, so long as they use the proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio or buy Treasury securities.

The novel reagents for antigen-specific CD8+ T cell detection are designed to offer researchers unprecedented flexibility, speed, and MHC allele-coverage, with over 50 HLA alleles available.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSupplied as highly robust, empty, biotinylated MHC Class I molecules, ProImmune’s ProVE <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">SL </em>Monomers offer an extended allele range including HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and non-canonical alleles, as well as mouse H-2. The ProVE <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">SL</em> platform allows researchers to load their own peptides and flexibly combine monomers with a wide range of avidin or streptavidin conjugates—including fluorescent, barcoded, or mass-cytometry reagents—to easily create tetramers or surface-bound complexes. This flexibility enables faster experimental setup, reconfiguration of panels, expanded donor-cohort coverage, including less common alleles, and integration with advanced flow and mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing workflows.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nT cell immunology, epitope mapping and immune-monitoring workflows increasingly demand reagents that permit rapid customisation across diverse HLA contexts. The ProVE <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">SL</em> monomers address key limitations of conventional pre-loaded MHC monomers, which often restrict peptide choice, require complex loading and exchange steps, or cover only frequent alleles. By enabling self-loading of peptides, the ProVE <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">SL</em> platform empowers immunologists to adapt their reagents more quickly to new antigens, for example for infectious diseases, cancer neo-antigens, autoantigens, and measuring vaccine responses and to study donor cohorts with rarer HLA types.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">“With the launch of our new ProVE SL monomers, we are offering researchers the ability to customise MHC monomer reagents at unprecedented speed and breadth,”</em> <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">said Dr. Nikolai Schwabe, CEO at ProImmune.</strong> <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">“This flexibility will accelerate epitope mapping, immune-monitoring and translational across research programmes, including in infectious disease and oncology. ProVE SL Monomers are a natural extension to our market-leading product ranges in MHC Class I/II monomers, multimers, and immunology services, as well as our extensive peptide synthesis capability.”</em>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ProVE <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">SL</em> Self-Loading MHC Class I Monomers are available now through ProImmune’s catalog and distributor network.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Steve Goldstein </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     High-yield bonds have outperformed stocks during low-growth periods, fund manager finds </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may be a good time for junk bonds, argues AllianceBernstein. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's a huge barrage of news that has hit investors this week, but the bigger picture is that the stock market is flirting with records at a time when faith in the economy is eroding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So there was a timely piece of analysis making a case on how investors can take some risk off the table without sacrificing too much in return. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's from portfolio managers at AllianceBernstein, who make the case for high-yield bonds - often called junk - as a substitute for investors who want to pare back their stock-market holdings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Investors looking to remain in stocks but rotate out of higher-risk holdings typically look to rebalance into investment-grade bonds. Government bonds and high-quality credit assets do have their place in a diversified portfolio, but we believe high-yield corporate bonds warrant a closer look-particularly in today's market,\" says a piece from William Smith, director of credit, and AJ Rivers, head of U.S. retail fixed-income business development. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 25 years, high yield JNK has produced average annual returns of 7.6%, versus the S&amp;P 500's SPX 9.8%, but at nearly half the volatility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"By shifting a portion of their equity holdings into high yield, investors could meaningfully reduce their overall volatility while conceding relatively little in return. What's more, we think the return and volatility relationship between high yield and equities may be even more compelling than usual today, thanks to a combination of elevated yields and slow economic growth,\" they say. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In periods of low growth, high yield actually outperforms equities. And, historically, high price-to-earnings multiples often correlate with below-average returns. \"Given increasingly sluggish demand and diminished global trade, the timing could be just right, in our view, to deploy high yield,\" they say. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are two risks to this path that go unaddressed in the AllianceBernstein piece. One is that the U.S. economy will outright tip into the recession. Separate data finds high-yield bonds fell in value by 5% during the 2008 global financial crisis and tumbled 8% in the short-lived COVID downturn. That's still not as bad as stocks during those time periods but not the positive return that government bonds saw in both downturns.  Investment-grade bonds meanwhile produced gains during the financial crisis and saw smaller losses during the pandemic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The other big risk is that investors would underperform if the economy doesn't decelerate, a possibility if artificial intelligence is as revolutionary for the economy as many of the world's top tech companies seem to believe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock futures (ES00) (NQ00) pointed lower.

The new research spotlights the pressures facing public finance teams as they manage billions of dollars in resident payments across areas such as property taxes, permits, court fines, and utilities—often with lean staff and disconnected systems that increase inefficiency, risk, and frustration.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nConstituent payments now account for 46% of the average local government’s total revenue, according to the <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftaxpolicycenter.org%2Fbriefing-book%2Fwhat-are-sources-revenue-state-and-local-governments&amp;esheet=54346743&amp;newsitemid=20251030832673&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Tax+Policy+Center&amp;index=4&amp;md5=f5ca173375722a4e92e6335c2526a32e\" tabindex=\"0\">Tax Policy Center</a>. Yet despite their importance, these payments are still largely managed through fragmented processes and outdated technology. According to Euna’s report, nearly two-thirds of agencies spend more than 10 hours each month reconciling across multiple systems, with some reporting workloads exceeding 80 hours.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“The report’s findings make one thing clear: modernizing payment and reconciliation systems is no longer a back-office upgrade. It’s a public trust imperative,” said Tom Amburgey, CEO of Euna Solutions. “As citizens demand more transparent, accessible, and equitable government services, finance leaders must bridge the gap between tradition and transformation. The agencies that act now to unify systems and embrace modernization will be the ones best positioned to deliver trust, efficiency, and resilience in the years ahead.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Lean Teams, Heavy Workloads</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBased on responses from 58 finance professionals representing cities, counties, and special districts, the report reveals just how lean most public finance teams have become:\n\n</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n47% of agencies have one to two employees managing payments.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nAnother 45% have three to five.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThese small teams are responsible for processing high transaction volumes while maintaining accuracy, compliance, and timely reconciliation. The burden is compounded by “vendor sprawl”—half of respondents use three or more vendors—which multiplies reconciliation steps and increases audit risk.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Top Frustrations and Disconnects</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSurvey participants identified their top three frustrations as:\n\n</p><ol class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--ordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nManual reconciliation\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nManaging multiple systems\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\nLack of system integration\n\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDespite these challenges, system and vendor consolidation ranked among the lowest 2026 priorities, revealing what the report calls a “survival mindset” in many agencies. Instead of tackling root-cause fragmentation, many finance teams remain focused on short-term workload relief. Externally, delinquent payments emerged as the most pressing challenge, cited by 60% of respondents. Yet increasing on-time payments did not rank among the top future priorities, signaling the need for a strategic shift toward holistic modernization.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Balancing Modernization and Citizen Choice</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWhile digital transformation remains a priority, modernization cannot come at the expense of accessibility. 83% of agencies still accept payments by mail, and half continue to rely on in-person cashiering. Community resistance to engaging digitally remains high, reinforcing that modernization must include all payment channels, not just online options.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Opportunities in Centralization and AI</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe report finds clear opportunities for agencies to relieve staff burden and improve cash flow by centralizing payment operations through inclusive, multi-channel platforms. Unified systems reduce reconciliation time, improve transparency, and strengthen public trust.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWhile AI adoption remains early, promising use cases are emerging. Respondents identified automation of reconciliation (38%) and fraud detection or anomaly monitoring (33%) as key areas of potential. As public-sector-ready AI tools mature, finance teams could gain faster insights, reduce errors, and better allocate limited resources.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Five Defining Trends for 2026 and Beyond</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe report concludes with five trends shaping the future of public payments:\n\n</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Community resistance to digital-only systems underscores the need for inclusive options: </strong>Many residents still prefer to pay by mail or in person, highlighting the importance of maintaining equitable, multi-channel payment options that ensure no citizen is left behind.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Manual operations remain unsustainable for small finance teams: </strong>Heavy reliance on spreadsheets and manual reconciliation continues to drain limited staff capacity, increase error risk, and divert focus from higher-value strategic or analytical work.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Delinquent payments continue to strain cash flow and resources: </strong>Late or missed payments reduce available funds for essential services, requiring agencies to devote significant time and staff to collections, reporting, and compliance follow-ups.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Lean staffing magnifies the impact of inefficiency: </strong>With most agencies operating with five or fewer staff managing payments, even minor process inefficiencies or turnover can disrupt operations, delay reconciliation, and increase compliance risk.\n\n</li>\n<li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Fragmented systems increase risk, cost, and complexity: </strong>Using multiple vendors and disconnected platforms complicates reconciliation, inflates support costs, and creates data silos that hinder accurate reporting and reduce overall financial transparency.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRead the <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feunasolutions.com%2F2025-state-of-payments%2F&amp;esheet=54346743&amp;newsitemid=20251030832673&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=2025+State+of+Public+Payments+and+Reconciliation+Report&amp;index=5&amp;md5=89e2d5894236b3a576dc5ff9d3c63235\" tabindex=\"0\">2025 State of Public Payments and Reconciliation Report</a> today.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Euna Solutions</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nEuna Solutions® is a leading provider of purpose-built, cloud-based software that helps public sector and government organizations streamline procurement, budgeting, payments, grants management, and special education administration.
