The U.S. central bank cut interest rates by a quarter point, but pushed back against market expectations that another rate cut at its next gathering in December was certain. Lower rates typically boost the appeal of non-yielding assets like gold. \"The ongoing government shutdown has clearly clouded the Fed's view, with limited access to official government data,\" says Aaron Hill from FP Markets.

There is a huge opportunity for them to provide education on how to use AI and build AI automations for their clients, but the challenge is that they must do this in addition to everything else they're offering.
