Rates have fallen overall since the start of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling mortgage rates are giving home buyers something they haven't seen in a long time: a glimpse of affordability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average 30-year mortgage rate hit 5.98% as of Feb. 26, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.01% the prior week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A year ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.76%. Elevated mortgage rates and high home prices have forced many house hunters to put off buying plans in recent years. That's driven home sales down and pushed the average age of a first-time home buyer to an all-time high of 40. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But falling mortgage rates have now pumped up buyers' purchasing power. A household making the median income of about $86,300 can now \"comfortably afford\" a $331,483 home with a 20% down payment, according to a new analysis from the real-estate platform Zillow (Z). That's $30,000 more than a year ago, Zillow said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The median price of a home in the U.S. was $396,800 as of January, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A more than $30,000 gain in buying power is meaningful for households that have been stretched thin by high rates. It can mean the difference between settling and choosing,\" noted Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow, in the report. \"That doesn't suddenly make this market affordable for everyone, but it does crack open doors that had firmly shut when rates peaked.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mortgage rates under 3% during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a rush of home buyers. But when rates soared to over 7% in late 2023 and home prices continued to tick upward, many would-be buyers were shut out of the market. That pushed home sales to 31-year low in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some see the chance for increased home sales in the coming months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For the first time in three-and-a-half years, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped into the 5% range, falling even lower than last week's milestone,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's (FMCC) chief economist. \"This rate, combined with the improving availability of homes for sale, is meaningful and will drive more potential buyers into the market for spring home-buying season.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about real estate that you would like to see covered in MarketWatch?

The new eConsent offering can be deployed in under four weeks and is available as a lightweight, cost‑effective module or as a fully integrated component of the DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn EDC and DCT ecosystem.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Unlike many eConsent tools that are bundled only within large, expensive ePRO or DCT packages, DATATRAK's standalone eConsent delivers flexible pricing so study teams can implement digital informed consent without paying for an entire ePRO system they do not need. Reasonable, study‑level pricing makes eConsent accessible for a broader range of trials and budgets, including early‑phase, single‑site, and investigator‑initiated studies.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Study teams want the benefits of modern eConsent-faster startup, better participant understanding, and cleaner documentation-without lengthy implementations or bloated platform costs,\" said Alex Tabatabai, CEO, DATATRAK. \"Our standalone eConsent is purpose‑built to launch quickly, fit into existing study infrastructure, and scale seamlessly when sponsors are ready to expand into DATATRAK EDC, ePRO, RTSM, CTMS, or full decentralized clinical trials.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Fast Startup, IND‑Ready Timelines</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The DATATRAK eConsent solution is designed for implementation timelines of under four weeks, allowing study teams to go live in time for IND or ethics approval and first‑patient‑in milestones. Configuration is supported by reusable templates and best‑practice workflows that help streamline approvals and site activation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Standalone eConsent with Enterprise‑Grade Integration</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The eConsent module can be used as a standalone utility and integrated with third‑party infrastructure, including external EDC, RTSM, CTMS, and eTMF systems, or deployed as a native component of DATATRAK EDC. When used with DATATRAK EDC, consent data and enrollment status are seamlessly connected to subject records, randomization, and visit schedules, enabling true end‑to‑end digital trial execution on a single platform.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Key Capabilities Include:</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">1.

Designed for protocol amendments and regulatory workflows</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">DATATRAK's eConsent simplifies managing protocol amendments and re‑consent, a common pain point for sponsors and sites. Study teams can easily trigger and track re‑consent when protocol changes occur, ensuring every participant is on the correct version and that audit trails remain inspection‑ready.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The system also supports tracking and managing supporting documents such as witness statements, translations, and supplemental information, helping maintain complete, compliant records across sites and regions.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Flexible Patient Engagement and Enrollment Options</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To support both site‑based and remote enrollment, the eConsent solution enables sites to invite participants using multiple methods: email links, QR codes patients can scan on their own device, or direct registration by the physician or site staff. Sites can also schedule consent visits prior to trial enrollment, helping ensure participants have adequate time to review materials, ask questions, and complete consent in a controlled, compliant workflow.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">When combined with DATATRAK's EDC, ePRO, and eSource capabilities, sponsors can extend the same patient‑centric digital experience beyond consent to ongoing data collection and engagement throughout the study.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About DATATRAK</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn is transforming healthcare and life sciences through technological innovations by providing a unified, cloud based eClinical and decentralized clinical trial platform that brings together EDC, eSource, ePRO/eCOA, eConsent, RTSM, RBM, Adjudication, Imaging, Safety, Global Oversight and Enterprise Workflow Management, CTMS, eTMF, and DCT tools in a single, configurable environment.
