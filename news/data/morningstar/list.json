            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Paul Vieira </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada is mulling incentives for automakers to maintain and expand operations here by issuing credits that exempt them from retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made cars they want to sell to the Canadian public. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The credit system is an element of a new automotive strategy that Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled this month, designed to preserve domestic motor-vehicle assembly and auto-parts production amid President Trump's 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars. On Friday, the Department of Finance issued proposed changes to a waiver system currently in place that allows automakers that make cars in Canada to import vehicles from their U.S. plants without facing Canada's own 25% retaliatory levy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The present waiver system gives automakers operating here--in particular, the big Detroit companies--a quota of cars they can import from the U.S. without being subject to tariffs. Canada has cut the allowable quota allotted to Stellantis and General Motors due to their decisions to curtail production in the country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The waiver system would be replaced by credits. The credits would be issued \"based on each company's contribution to the domestic automotive industry,\" the department said in a consultation paper. \"In essence, the more a company produces and invests in Canada, the more import credits it would earn.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canada added that the credits would be tradable, so companies with a surplus could sell them to other car makers seeking to import U.S.-made vehicles into Canada. Companies without a sufficient number of import credits would have to pay Canada's retaliatory tariffs, according to the finance ministry's consultation paper. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Such a credit system \"can work but it doesn't give you as large an automotive base, necessarily,\" said Stephen Beatty, a former senior executive at Toyota Motor's Canadian unit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. doesn't need cars made in Canada. The auto-specific levies are a tool Trump is deploying to persuade global automakers to shift operations from abroad to the U.S. to serve the American market. The strategy has had an impact. Last year, Stellantis said it would transfer production of its Jeep Compass model from a Toronto-area factory to Illinois. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Under the credit system, automakers gain credits for vehicles produced here. On top of that, Ottawa is also looking at the distribution of extra credits to manufacturers that: produce engines, batteries and transmission in Canada for vehicle assembly; enter the Canadian market for the first time; and use an increasing amount of Canadian content in production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Officials say Canada's auto strategy is focused on rewarding car companies that are building here and expanding their operations. Data from the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing, a nonprofit organization, indicate that the share of auto production in Canada from Stellantis, GM and Ford has declined to 23% last year from 56% in 2016. Conversely, Honda and Toyota account for 77% of auto production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Brian Kingston, head of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said earlier this month that the proposed credit system must reward auto companies with existing investments here. His group represents GM, Stellantis and Ford, and Kingston said those companies have invested about $9 billion in their factories since 2022. He added the three companies operate nine assembly plants, and eight auto research-and-development centers. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 12:45 ET (17:45 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Venessa Wong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Baby boomers may not be the 'avocado toast' generation, but they have plenty of their own wasteful and financially damaging habits </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Boomers are more wasteful in certain spending categories than their younger counterparts. These habits can be harmful for the many people in this cohort who are financially vulnerable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The wasteful habits of millennials and Gen Z members should come as no surprise - it has been well documented that many of these consumers are prone to impulse online spending and have grown addicted to the convenience of delivery apps. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But new survey data show that baby boomers - America's richest generation and one often perceived as being thriftier those that followed - are more wasteful in certain spending categories than younger people. And those habits can be especially harmful for the many people in this unevenly wealthy cohort who are financially vulnerable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Specifically, baby boomers are more likely than the average consumer to waste food by throwing out leftovers or expired items, to leave appliances or utilities running unnecessarily, to buy brand-name pantry items and to buy lottery tickets, according to a recent survey by Motley Fool Money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And these habits have only gotten more expensive: Food prices increased by 2.9% in January compared with a year earlier, gas utility costs rose by 9.8% and electricity went up 6.3%, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Once you are drawing from savings instead of building it, small recurring expenses matter more,\" said Melissa Caro, a financial planner and founder of My Retirement Network, a financial education site. \"Utilities, food waste and lifestyle inflation can quietly erode cash flow over a 20- to 30-year retirement. Even households with meaningful assets need to manage longevity risk, healthcare uncertainty and rising living costs.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Boomers - who were born between 1946 and 1964 - were more likely than Americans on average to waste money during shopping trips, while on vacation or for special occasions, the poll of 2,000 U.S. adults found. Their most common trigger was sales and discounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the other hand, millennials, who were born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, were more likely to waste money online late at night. Members of Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980, were the most vulnerable to emotionally driven shopping but, along with boomers, were much more likely than younger generations to resist social-media trends and peer influence, the Motley Fool survey showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite their wasteful ways, boomers are the wealthiest cohort in U.S. history. Many were buoyed by the postwar economic boom, access to affordable college educations and workplace pensions, and growth in the housing and stock markets, MarketWatch recently reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In line with broader trends in the economy, however, their wealth is not evenly distributed across the generation. Pew Research Center found that the top 10% of boomer households owned 71% of the generation's overall wealth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For instance, Americans 70 to 74, who fall in the middle of the current boomer age range, have a median net worth of about $476,000, including home equity, MarketWatch previously reported - meaning half of the people in that group have a net worth that is lower. The net worth for those in the 90th percentile is nearly $3.3 million, or 6.8 times the median. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This wealth gap suggests that for many boomers, wasteful spending habits could have a meaningful impact on their financial well-being. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The \"huge inequality within the boomer generation itself\" means \"some have paid-off homes and strong portfolios. Others rely almost entirely on Social Security and have very little margin for error,\" Juan G. HernandezAriano, a financial planner and principal at WealthCreate, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In his experience, boomers are largely \"pretty cost-conscious in day-to-day spending,\" but many are casual about larger financial decisions that \"slowly chip away at retirement security,\" such as underestimating healthcare expenses or being overly conservative with their investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only 40% of boomers - the youngest of whom are already 62 years old - are ready for retirement, Vanguard estimates, meaning their projected sustainable income exceeds their spending needs. These people are \"concentrated among the top 30% of income earners.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other signs that many boomers may be victims of poor spending habits: More reported living paycheck to paycheck - meaning their spending on necessities took up more than 95% of their income - in 2025 than in 2023, according to the Bank of America Institute. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average credit-card debt was $6,795 for boomers, 82.9% of whom had credit-card debt in 2025, a higher rate than millennials (77.9%) or Gen Z (72.2%), according to Experian. They were also the most likely to have home-equity lines of credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some may not even be aware of their spending habits. Boomers were more likely than other generations to say they never waste money - but \"that doesn't mean that there isn't waste. It just shows up a little differently,\" Joel O'Leary, personal finance expert at Motley Fool Money, told MarketWatch. \"It's more like throwing away unused groceries or continuing to go to Costco or some of those expensive stores and buying in bulk, and then throwing away much of it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wasteful habits are harmful when they start to impact financial security. While one-third of baby boomers said they had to tap their emergency savings in the last 12 months,16% of people in this age range said they have no emergency savings, according to 2025 Bankrate data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Like any consumer, boomers who want to avoid wasting money can consider tracking and analyzing expenses and cutting back on expenses that don't actually improve their quality of life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Caro \"wouldn't describe wasteful spending as a defining boomer trait,\" she noted that \"many boomers were raised by parents who lived through the Great Depression. That experience tends to produce strong money beliefs - sometimes in the direction of extreme thrift, and sometimes in the opposite direction. In families where scarcity was intense, the next generation can either internalize 'waste not, want not' or subconsciously react against it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What personal-finance issues would you like to see covered in MarketWatch?

Designed to power mixer operation without engine idling, the system addresses one of the ready-mix industry’s most persistent operational challenges — unnecessary idling during loading, waiting, and pouring — while supporting lower fuel use, reduced emissions, reduced regens, and improved total cost of ownership.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227931870/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227931870/en/</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDeveloped over the past three years and built on more than a decade of electrification and hybrid development, field testing, and multi-generation engineering refinement, e-HYDRIVE delivers full drum performance at the jobsite with the chassis engine off. Early field testing demonstrates measurable reductions in idle time and fuel consumption across daily production cycles.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nTraditionally, mixer trucks must run the chassis engine to power the drum during loading, waiting, and pouring. e-HYDRIVE changes that model. The self-charging, non-plug-in hybrid system powers the drum electrically, with the battery automatically charging while the truck is driving, and includes built-in operational redundancy that allows the truck to operate traditionally if needed.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDesigned for both new builds and retrofits, e-HYDRIVE requires no significant modification to existing mixer components, allowing seamless integration across active fleets while minimizing downtime.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our customers have consistently told us they need practical electrification solutions that work in real production environments — not theoretical concepts,” said Bryan Datema, Executive Vice President – Engineering, Innovation, and Product Performance, Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery. “e-HYDRIVE was engineered alongside those needs. It reduces unnecessary idling, lowers operating costs, and prepares fleets for the future of electrified chassis platforms without disrupting daily operations.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs part of its development, e-HYDRIVE has operated in active production environments with Amrize, an industry-leading concrete producer known for evaluating emerging technologies. This collaboration allowed Revolution | London to validate durability, usability, and real-world performance under demanding operating conditions while maintaining full ownership of product design and specifications.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“This has been a long-term testing effort across multiple generations of the system,” said Ian Paine, Amrize. “We’ve seen the evolution firsthand. Innovation at this level doesn’t happen overnight — it requires commitment, iteration, and a willingness to stay engaged until the value is clear. Solutions like this also require a broader cultural shift in how we approach sustainably delivered concrete.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor Revolution | London, e-HYDRIVE represents more than a product milestone — it reflects a broader commitment to advancing the industry.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“We believe meaningful innovation must solve real operational challenges while helping move the entire industry forward,” said Bob Monchamp, President, Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery. “Electrification in concrete delivery is not a distant concept — it’s happening now. Solutions like e-HYDRIVE help set the foundation for the next era of mixer technology and accelerate the next generation of sustainable concrete delivery.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRevolution | London will showcase e-HYDRIVE at CONEXPO-CON/AGG (Booth C30220, Central Hall) beginning March 3, where attendees can learn more about how the company continues to engineer forward-looking mixer technologies built on real-world validation and performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery\n<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery Inc. represent a combined 171 years of industry and mixer-building knowledge, serving customers across the United States, Canada, and around the world.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada's economy shrank as it closed out 2025, yet still managed to show resilience against the U.S. administration's protectionist shift. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Gross domestic product declined at an annualized rate of 0.6% in the October-to-December period to 2.502 trillion Canadian dollars, the equivalent of US$1.829 trillion, Statistics Canada said Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The contraction was slightly steeper than the 0.2% economists expected following a recovery in the prior quarter. But the weakness was largely thanks to a big withdrawal from business inventories that offset growth in exports, and increases in both household and government spending. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Industry-level activity strengthened in the final month of the year, though advance data indicates a shaky start to this year and no growth as activity was likely held back by snowstorms and severe cold temperatures. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canada was broadsided last year by President Trump's tariffs, particularly the country's trade exposed industries and sectors singled out by the White House's sectoral levies on steel, aluminum, lumber and other goods that enter the U.S. in large volumes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Over 2025, Canadian real GDP grew 1.7%, the slowest pace since a drop in 2020 during the global pandemic, largely due to a decline in exports to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Yet data for the final quarter of last year highlights continued strength at home and a recovery in exports, helped by efforts to direct shipments to markets beyond the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Final domestic demand, a gauge of spending by all sectors of the economy, grew 2.4% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter after falling 0.5% the previous quarter. Household spending rose 0.4% on a nonannualized basis after weakening slightly in the prior quarter, leaving household consumption for the year up 2.3% and in line with the 2.2% pace in each of the previous two years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Added to that was a second consecutive quarter of increased government spending and a massive increase in defense spending. Investment by Canadian businesses dipped slightly for the quarter, though there was a sharp increase in spending on machinery and equipment, primarily computers. Overall, capital investment was up in 2025 with the jump in spending on weapons systems and a slight increase in residential construction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The relatively positive composition of GDP data for the quarter is expected to allow the Bank of Canada to remain on the sidelines after keeping its policy interest rate steady twice in a row, economists said. That is despite the central bank projecting a flat fourth quarter, and the possibility the first quarter of 2026 will undershoot the 1.8% growth it most recently forecast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dominique Lapointe, director of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said that while the fourth quarter surprised to the downside there was a revision to the contraction seen in the second quarter to just 0.9% annualized from a prior estimate of 1.8%. \"From the Bank of Canada's perspective, this leaves the output gap largely unchanged, albeit negative, and doesn't open the door to additional rate cuts,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The biggest drag on GDP came from the drawdown in inventories, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  an often volatile metric, after businesses boosted stocks the previous two quarters. For the year, non-farm inventories fell for the first year since 2020, even as farm stocks rose for the first time in three years with strong crop production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The country's exports, meanwhile, were up 1.5% for the final quarter, driven by shipments of unwrought gold and of aluminum. Yet despite the recovery in the second half of 2025, exports for 2025 were down 1.7% as trade with the U.S. failed to fully recover. Imports nudged up 0.3% in the final quarter, but were down 0.4% for the year after a steep decline in the third quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected last April as a counter to President Trump, has pledged to strengthen the resilience of Canada's economy and decouple it from a dependence on its biggest trading partner. The push includes efforts by the former central banker to bring financial relief to sectors hit hardest by tariffs while pushing for a doubling of non-U.S. exports over the next decade. There are indications these efforts are bearing fruit: the U.S. has gone from being the destination for roughly 70% of Canadian exports to about 64% at the latest count. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Economists expect soft momentum in 2026 and the central bank has forecast growth will average about 1.1% for the year. A new federal groceries and essentials benefit is expected to offer a boost at mid-year with other fiscal measures, and the recovery in exports should support stronger growth in the second half, though that hinges on trade talks between with the U.S., said Michael Davenport, senior Canada economist at Oxford Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The national data agency said industry-level GDP in December was up 0.2% from the month before, the strongest growth since September as manufacturing increased after contracting two months running. Still, the advance estimate indicates GDP was essentially unchanged in January, as increases in mining, oil and gas extraction, and finance and insurance, were offset by renewed weakness in manufacturing and real estate weakness. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.
