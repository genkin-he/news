It has voting rights of 11.5% but with the option to boost that to more than 50% if Rapidus runs into any financial or operational problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The initial capital injection will be deployed immediately, with an additional 150 billion yen earmarked in the upcoming budget, bringing the government's total equity commitment in Rapidus to 250 billion yen for the 2026 fiscal year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The move signals a shift toward a more aggressive industrial policy as Japan pushes to regain its footing in the global silicon arms race, industry analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Japan has pinned its hopes on Rapidus, a state-backed venture established in 2022 with the mission of developing home-grown advanced chipmaking capacity. It has also been courting foreign companies, seeking to bring their expertise into the domestic ecosystem. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. finalized an agreement to produce 3-nanometer chips at its second Japanese facility in Kumamoto, an upgrade from previous plans for more mature nodes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That was a major leap for Japan, which doesn't yet have capacity to mass produce advanced chips essential for artificial intelligence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The government has been pushing to change that, backing projects like the Kumamoto expansion, which provides a high-volume manufacturing baseline for the country. Rapidus meanwhile is focused on the even more ambitious goal of making 2-nanometer logic chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  To further safeguard its investment in the state-backed venture, the government will hold a so-called \"golden share\" in Rapidus, granting it veto power over board decisions to protect against economic security risks and foreign influence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A combined $1.07 billion investment pledge in Rapidus from 32 companies reflects renewed interest from the private sector too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The investment pool, which includes contributions from a broad range of domestic industry leaders, surpassed the government's initial projections for private funding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The capital commitment \"exceeds the initial target of 130 billion yen,\" a sign that \"expectations for the project are clearly mounting\", Akazawa said. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 23:25 ET (04:25 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

This was the second time it has expanded its buyback program after initially approving 100 billion yen in November last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   The company now plans to repurchase up to 90 million shares by May, representing more than 1.5% of its outstanding shares.

It added that the plan was expanded to allow more flexibility in repurchases, after considering the current pace of buybacks and stock market trends. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The share price move may also reflect a shift in investor flows, as stocks of other gaming companies have also risen. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"Sony's stock increase is likely part of a broader movement to take profits on semiconductor-related stocks following Nvidia's earnings and to repurchase gaming-related stocks that had been recently sold off heavily,\" said Morningstar equity research director Kazunori Ito. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sony's shares, which outperformed other gaming stocks, gained even further in reaction to the share buyback expansion, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"We are seeing rotation into laggards like...Sony that [had] been trading woefully with AI and semiconductor related names sucking in all the flows,\" with the shift expected to continue into March, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Jason Chau at jason.chau@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 23:29 ET (04:29 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 6, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided investors with material information concerning their expected results for the Phase 3 Orbit and COSMIC studies for setrusumab in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in setrusumab's ability to ultimately reduce the annualized fracture rates of the tested patients and in the study itself to put setrusumab in an opportunity to succeed in reaching statistical significance of this key endpoint.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The defendants, the lawsuit claims, provided these positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating false and materially misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of the Phase 3 ORBIT and COSMIC programs; neither of which hit their primary endpoints of reducing annualized clinical fracture rate compared to the placebo or bisphosphonate control groups, respectively. Such statements absent these material facts caused investors to purchase Mereo's ADSs at artificially inflated prices. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Mereo class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=3988179742&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D52452&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D52452\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=52452</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=2473771113&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthe-rosen-law-firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm</a>, on Twitter: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=2836826685&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frosen_firm\" tabindex=\"0\">https://twitter.com/rosen_firm</a> or on Facebook: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628885-1&amp;h=1496023824&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frosenlawfirm%2F\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/</a>.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Attorney Advertising.

The restructuring will bring Block's (XYZ) employee count below 6,000 versus more than 10,000 today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Block soared 23.5% in after-hours action on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The layoffs at Block come just days after Citrini Research rattled markets with the publication of a blog post detailing a fictional scenario in which AI productivity tools were so powerful that they forced widespread shifts in the U.S. labor market. These particularly impacted knowledge workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" CEO Jack Dorsey said in a shareholder letter. \"We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By \"intelligence tools,\" the company is referring to AI and automation. CFO Amrita Ahuja said that Block has seen sizable productivity gains recently, not just among programmers but also within the broader company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within a year, Dorsey expects other companies to follow suit with \"similar structural changes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,\"  he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev also wondered whether the move would set a precedent for other technology companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block's \"deliberate and bold\" decision to dramatically reduce its workforce comes \"from a position of strength,\" according to Ahuja, as the company just exceeded expectations with various financial metrics and lifted its outlook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In its fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday, Block reported earnings per share of 65 cents, down from 71 cents a year before but ahead of the FactSet consensus by a penny. Gross profit, which is seen by Wall Street as a reasonably clean barometer for Block's top-line performance, was up 24% from a year before to $2.87 billion. Analysts were looking for $2.74 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block now expects 18% growth in gross profit for the full year, above the 17% target it set at an investor day late last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That new outlook reflects a \"recognition of our ability to continue to drive against our roadmap\" with a \"smaller, more nimble, flatter organizational structure,\" Ahuja said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
