            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     No one should be 'all-in' or stay 'all-out' of AI, says Oaktree co-founder </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Howard Marks is much less skeptical about AI than he was just a few months ago </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In December, Howard Marks published an investment memo titled, \"Is it a bubble?\" that expressed some of his skepticism and reservations about artificial intelligence and the stock market boom it had created. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A few months and one tutorial from Anthropic's Claude AI model later, Marks' latest investment memo has the header \"AI hurtles ahead.\" It's fair to say that if Marks hasn't been completely converted to a bull on AI investment, he is now convinced of the revolutionary technological benefits it brings. He guesses its potential is underestimated, but warns that may not mean the investment price is right. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, Marks' opinions are well-regarded. So when a few months back he cautioned about \"the regularity of bubbles,\" \"bubble behavior\" and the \"end result is inevitably painful,\" investors in AI stocks sat up and listened. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Encouraged by some of those investors to try out a few of the AI models available, Marks placed the Claude bot under scrutiny and came away thoroughly impressed. It's not quite a Damascene conversion, but he's certainly much more open to the technology's upside potential. For example, he kicks off with, \"Before I start in, I want to try to communicate the level of awe with which I viewed Claude's output\". </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given the week of bad PR that AI has endured in the aftermath of a viral Citrini Research paper, whose portrait of economic doom was heightened further by Block's decision to halve its workforce and shed 4000 jobs, the AI industry needed a boost. Now it has received what it can plausibly describe as a ringing endorsement from one of America's most reputable and experienced investors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What impressed Marks was the ability of AI to act autonomously, he said.  \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Commenting on the massive leap in capabilities in just a few months, Marks makes the point that in terms of analyzing information: \"AI possesses a lot of the qualities one needs to be a good investor.\" Citing ChatGPT-5.3 Codex and Claude's Opus 4.6, Marks notes AI is making \"intelligent decisions and even contributing to its own code and improvement, creating an accelerating feedback loop.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When it comes to making investment decisions, he now acknowledges that like indexation became a competitive threat to active investment management, AI may well push out \"average\" investors, partly because its rationale won't be tainted with human emotions like greed and fear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weighing the scales now, as opposed to his December debate over whether the AI investment theme is a bubble or not, Marks concludes by emphasizing that just because the technology is real and revolutionary doesn't mean that every investment is safe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He regards circular revenue and \"lottery-ticket startups\" as risky. He is deeply worried about \"labor displacement\" but overall, concludes it's just too early to say whether AI is \"a fad or an illusion\". </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Forecasts suggest Howard Marks (and many other commentators) are right to be concerned about labor displacement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not knowing whether the investment in AI infrastructure can produce an adequate return, Marks finds it hard to say whether hyperscalers are under or overvalued. The potential for AI is most likely underestimated, he believes,  \"but that's not the same as saying AI investments are on the bargain counter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"No one should go all-in... but by the same token, no one should stay all-out.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Giulia Petroni </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet Sunday with a familiar dilemma: add barrels to the market or continue holding back against a fragile geopolitical backdrop. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OPEC+, the alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided to keep output steady in the first quarter after a series of production increases last year. Analysts say the group is now expected to resume hikes, starting with a modest increase of 137,000 barrels a day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  An output boost would signal the alliance is restarting the gradual rollback of voluntary cuts of around 1.65 million barrels a day originally set to remain in place through the end of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Some analysts expect the remaining curbs to be unwound within six months, while others see the process stretching to year-end. Many warn, however, that only about half of any quota increase typically translates into actual output, as some members face capacity constraints. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OPEC didn't respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"The oil market should be able to absorb further barrels,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, strategist at UBS. The ICE Brent forward curve remains in backwardation--meaning near-term oil prices are higher than future prices--suggesting the market is tight in the short term. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Goldman Sachs sees OPEC+ positioned to raise production modestly from April to June after a series of supply disruptions earlier this year, particularly in Kazakhstan, and due to lower-than-expected inventories in OECD countries. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Much of the anticipated surplus remains outside major pricing hubs, with Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan barrels accumulating on tankers at sea. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns are keeping front-month prices supported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In midmorning European trading Friday, Brent traded around $71 a barrel, while WTI was above $65 a barrel. A February survey of major Wall Street banks compiled by The Wall Street Journal showed Brent crude is expected to average at around $61 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $58 in the second quarter--above previous projections by around $1, but still below 2025 levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The resumption of output hikes would come as markets closely monitor developments in the Middle East, wary that any escalation between the U.S. and Iran could disrupt energy flows in the oil-rich region. The two countries are expected to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks wrapped up on Thursday without a deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"Any escalation of conflict is likely to see OPEC step in to calm the market,\" said Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari, commodity analysts at ANZ Research. If disruptions occur, OPEC+ is expected to tap spare capacity--with most of it sitting in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 05:38 ET (10:38 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Kelsi Karruli </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The property offers sweeping views of the mountains, valleys, and ocean. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gene Simmons is spotted at an L.A. Clippers basketball game in Inglewood, Calif., Jan. 12, 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Music legend Gene Simmons has yet again slashed the asking price of his former Beverly Hills home-months after trimming a half-million dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Simmons, 76, initially listed the \"exceptional\" home for the staggering price of $13.99 million. That sum was reduced to $13.49 million in September. It's now priced at $12.5 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In total, the home has undergone a steep $1.49 million price cut. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The musician does still stand to make a profit on the sale of the property, even at the reduced ask. He purchased it for $10.5 million in 2021 to use as a California home base after he and his wife, Shannon Tweed Simmons, moved to Las Vegas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the Kiss rocker's property portfolio became increasingly complicated as a result of his Nevada relocation. It turned out to be nothing but a brief dalliance for the couple, who struggled with the area's punishing heat. They ultimately decided that they'd be better off returning to California. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What followed was a dramatic reshuffling of Simmons' real estate collection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, the rock legend listed his expansive Henderson, Nevada, property-along with an adjacent lot-just a few months after buying it, initially asking $13.5 million. He ultimately accepted an offer of just under $11 million two years later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The sale was a bit of a bitter pill for Simmons to swallow, leaving him with just $200,000 in profit after he paid $10.8 million for the combined properties. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     KISS rocker Gene Simmons testifies in Washington, D.C. at a Senate hearing on \"Balancing the Interests of Local Radio, Songwriters, and Performers in the Digital Age,\" on Dec. 9, 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, he came out of the transaction in the black-a result he celebrated by snapping up another expansive mansion in California in September 2024, which he and his wife are now using as their primary residence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Property records reveal that Simmons picked up the \"one-of-a-kind\" Malibu estate for $25 million using the same LLC through which he purchased his Beverly Hills abode-which he put on the market just seven months later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Malibu home sits on a 2.5-acre blufftop spread that is, per its original listing, \"surrounded by stunning ocean views\" and hundreds of trees, offering a lush environment that serves as the perfect sanctuary for any star. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adding to that feeling of privacy and security is the home's prime location behind its own gates, which create a safe barrier between Simmons and the outside world. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The residence was built using eco-friendly materials, including recycled steel and sustainable timber, and sources much of its power from Tesla (TSLA) batteries and solar panels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Additional eco-friendly luxury features are the \"water vapor fireplaces,\" built-in water filtration, and air ventilation system, which \"ensure a healthy lifestyle at all times.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The home features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as a luxurious chef's kitchen, a home theater, two wine rooms, and a full gym. Out back, there's a saltwater pool, spa, basketball court, bocce court, putting green, and driving range. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The 14,500-square-foot abode is almost twice the size of the Beverly Hills home that Simmons and his wife are still desperately trying to sell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may well be that Simmons' rather strict regulations for prospective buyers had led some to pause before even considering putting in an offer on the property-after he publicly stated that he would refuse to sell the dwelling to anyone who he feared might soil the happy memories he and his family have of their time in the home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You have such wonderful times there, you don't want some schmuck in the place you call home. No drugs, no alcoholics. I don't want anybody coming in there who is going to destroy the place,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in April. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: I'm 68, and I Sacrificed Our Second Bedroom to Build My Dream Bathroom for Less Than $15K </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Provided a buyer can make it through Simmons' strict selection process, they will have quite the opulent pad on their hands. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The pricey property, which is being listed by Lisa Young of Compass, comes with a \"40-foot glass-like infinity pool, dramatic drought-tolerant landscaping, and bold bronze geometric sculptures that offer a distinct artistic statement,\" according to a press release shared with Realtor.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Simmons' property was designed by Swiss architect Roger P. Kurath and is made of \"glass, steel, oak wood and concrete elements,\" which emphasize the sweeping views of the mountains, valleys, and ocean. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Home Prices Expected To Fall in Many Cities in 2026, Top Homebuilder Economist Says </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a statement, Simmons revealed that the views were what drew him to the property in the first place. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"My favorite part of the house is waking up in the morning in the upper bedroom, having coffee in bed, and on a clear day being able to see all the way out to the ocean,\" he shared. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"And my other favorite time is sunset in the upper bedroom or downstairs barbecuing something outdoors. The views really are spectacular.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The five-bathroom property boasts 12-foot ceilings, a gallery space, and a plush home theater. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Opulent Reno Trophy Estate Built by Late Casino King Lists for $14 Million </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And much like his newly purchased pad, Simmons' former home \"utilizes solar-power for pool and radiant heated flooring, eco-materials and fire-resistant, waterproof triple-panel windows.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This home is a rare example of Swiss architectural mastery, built with exceptional quality, thoughtful details, and a focus on longevity,\" Young adds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"From the Swiss steel framework and sleek fixtures to the fiber cement exterior panels that can go more than 50 years without maintenance, everything was designed to last.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Florida Migration Plunges 93% in 3 Years-but Miami Still Pulls High-Income Job Movers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The 40-foot glasslike infinity pool is a real showstopper, surrounded by lush, drought-tolerant landscaping, and the bold bronze geometric sculptures add a cool, artistic vibe to the outdoor space. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's the kind of property that's extremely rare and truly special-made even more iconic by having been home to a rock legend.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This story originally ran on Realtor.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Elena Vardon </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Swiss Re's shares traded higher after the reinsurer paired its quarterly results with a surprise $1 billion share buyback, signaling a more aggressive stance on capital returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Zurich-based group on Friday said that it would repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares over the course of the year. The program includes the introduction of a recurring annual $500 million buyback as announced late last year, plus the $1 billion top up. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The stock climbed around 5% in early trading to hit its highest level since before a December investor day that had weighed on shares. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  J.P. Morgan analysts described the unexpected extra buyback as \"the culmination of a number of resilience building activities and strong [Swiss Solvency Test ratio].\" The move reflects a pattern of proactive capital management often seen as pricing cycles soften, where underwriters prioritize capital returns over chasing volume, Jefferies wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods struck a more cautious note and questioned the sustainability of such payouts as the total capital return slightly exceeded net operating capital generation for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  For the full year, Swiss Re reported a 47% jump in net profit to a record $4.8 billion, beating its own guidance of more than $4.4 billion for 2025. The increase was driven by disciplined underwriting and a benign catastrophe environment in its property and casualty units, which helped offset a weaker showing in its life and health business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Performance in the last three months of the year was more nuanced. Swiss Re's net income reached $717 million, beating the company-compiled consensus of $687 million but falling sharply from the $1.05 billion recorded a year earlier. The top-line was also softer as insurance revenue slipped 6% to $11.14 billion while its investment result fell 12% to $966 million, with both metrics trailing consensus expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The quarterly print was weighed down by a review of underperforming life and health portfolios in Australia, Israel and South Korea. Swiss Re had warned this would shave off $250 million from its fourth-quarter earnings, leading it to miss its the division's annual profit target. While the review is now completed, analysts remain divided with some noting that the managed impact should reassure while others cautioned it may take some quarters of clean results to believe the issues are in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"All three of our business units are positioned to deliver consistent results,\" Chief Executive Officer Andreas Berger said. The company maintained its $4.5 billion net profit target for 2026, which includes a $1.7 billion contribution from the rehabilitated life and health business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In addition to the buybacks, the board proposed a 9% increase to its annual dividend to $8.0 per share. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Elena Vardon at elena.vardon@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 04:39 ET (09:39 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
