The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median monthly average decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That gives way to an even stronger March performance, potentially an average gain of 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement.

The Company possesses fantastic brands and has strong category growth tailwinds at its back. I see a clear path to create tremendous value for our shareholders and intend to make a sizable open-market purchase of Nomad shares in the coming weeks to express my confidence and align my interests with our shareholders. The value creation, however, will not be immediate and we have work to do to unlock our full potential. We have a number of opportunities to address in the organization, and we will be focused on these in the coming months. We continue to streamline the organization to increase our speed, agility, focus and accountability. We believe this will help us improve our commercial execution while unlocking additional resources for reinvestment. We are also ensuring that the right talent, sourced both internally and externally, is in the right roles to help us succeed. We believe we can and will deliver better results, but we anticipate 2026 being a transition year as our financial outlook reflects the time required to implement and manage change.

The company's portfolio is strong, category growth is robust and retail-sell out in 2025 delivered modest growth. The opportunity ahead is substantial.

In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to profit/(loss) for the period, determined in accordance with IFRS, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjusted Profit for the period is defined as profit for the period excluding, when they occur, the impacts of exited markets, acquisition purchase price adjustments and exceptional items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, net financing income/(cost) on amendment of terms of debt, interest cost on tax relating to legacy tax audits, foreign exchange translation gains/(losses), foreign exchange gains/(losses) on derivatives, as well as certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature. In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted Profit for the period provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of exited markets, acquisition purchase price adjustments and exceptional items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, net financing income/(cost) on amendment of terms of debt, interest cost on tax relating to legacy tax audits, foreign exchange translation gains/(losses), foreign exchange gains/(losses) on derivatives, certain one-time credits on the recognition of deferred tax assets, as well as certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature. In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance.

The comparison for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024 presented in this press release takes into consideration only those activities that were in effect during both time periods. Organic revenue growth/(decline) reflects reported revenue adjusted for currency translation and non-comparable trading items such as expansion, acquisitions, disposals, closures, trading day impacts or any other event that artificially impacts the comparability of our results period over period.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjusted Gross Profit and adjusted gross margin exclude accelerated depreciation associated with restructuring programs within cost of goods sold.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjustments for currency translation are calculated by translating data of the current and comparative periods using a budget foreign exchange rate that is set once a year as part of the Company's internal annual forecast process.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjusted Free Cash Flow is the amount of cash generated from operating activities less cash flows related to exceptional items (as described above), non-operating M&amp;A related costs and working capital movements on employer taxes associated with share based payment awards, plus capital expenditure (on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets), net interest paid, proceeds/(payments) on settlement of derivatives where hedge accounting is not applied and payments of lease liabilities. Adjusted free cash flow reflects cash flows that could be used for payment of dividends, repayment of debt or to fund acquisitions or other strategic objectives.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Cash flow conversion is Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted Profit for the period.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Adjusted and Organic non-IFRS financial information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements of Nomad Foods included in this press release as well as the historical financial statements of the Company previously filed with the SEC.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Nomad Foods believe its non-IFRS financial measures provide an important additional measure with which to monitor and evaluate the Company's ongoing financial results, as well as to reflect its acquisitions. Nomad Foods' calculation of these financial measures may be different from the calculations used by other companies and comparability may therefore be limited. The Adjusted and Organic financial information presented herein is based upon certain assumptions that Nomad Foods believes to be reasonable and is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of any anticipated financial position or future results of operations that the Company will experience. You should not consider the Company's non-IFRS financial measures an alternative or substitute for the Company's reported results and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these results and information as they may not be representative of our actual or future results as a Company.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Please see on pages 9 to 18, the non-IFRS reconciliation tables attached hereto and the schedules accompanying this release for an explanation and reconciliation of the Adjusted and Organic financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS measure. The Company is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, Organic Growth, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable IFRS measure.</p><span><table

An initial resource for Midlothian was published on December 18, 2025 with 590 million tonnes Inferred at 0.28% nickel.

The strong results across all samples highlight the potential of this resource, which contains significant quantities of awaruite ranging from 0.25-0.36% and has the highest average nickel grade in our portfolio (0.28%) and total nickel grades more than 30% higher than other leading awaruite deposits. Midlothian is emerging as one of the most promising deposits in the District.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mr. Selby continued, \"We are encouraged by these early results, especially as initial DTR tests were done at coarser grind size than other deposits. A finer grind may yield even higher DTR nickel results. Because the awaruite mineralization has been confirmed to be widespread at Midlothian, the Company plans to assay all existing and future drill holes to allow a DTR nickel resource grade to be calculated in addition to a total recoverable nickel resource.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Midlothian Project</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Midlothian is located 64 kilometres southwest of Timmins and 20 kilometres west of Matachewan, Ontario. It is a large serpentinized ultramafic approximately 2.5 km long and up to 520 metres wide - with a geophysical footprint of 1.7 km<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2</span> (similar to the combined footprint of Crawford's Main and East Zones) - consisting mainly of a highly serpentinized dunite core with minor peridotite and significant awaruite nickel mineralization accounting for up to 79% of the total nickel content.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">An initial total nickel resource estimate was published at the end of 2025 (see news release December 18, 2025) containing an Inferred Resource of 0.59 billion tonnes grading 0.28% nickel for a total of 1.68 million tonnes of nickel. The resource estimate was based on 22 drillholes, where all drillholes were sampled for geochemical analysis at an average rate of one core sample per 1.5 metres. In addition, one sample every twenty core samples was selected and submitted for mineralogical (QEMSCAN) testing.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This release summarizes the mineralogical results for 177 samples from the first 14 of the 22 drillholes (Figure 1), as well as metallurgical results for four separate composite representing different mineralization styles within the deposit (Table 1). The results highlight the thoroughly serpentinized nature of the ultramafics and confirm the different mineral forms in which nickel is hosted. Mineralogical results on the remaining eight holes are pending. The nickel mineralization is dominated by a nickel-iron alloy (awaruite) and minor nickel sulphide (heazlewoodite) Figure 2, Table 1. Both awaruite and heazlewoodite are minerals that have a higher nickel tenor, ranging between 65-75% nickel content.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Brucite, a key mineral indicator for carbon sequestration potential was also identified by QEMSCAN. Midlothian contains significantly higher abundance than both Crawford's East and Main Zones.

samples representing different mineralization styles taken from the Midlothian drill core. The samples were prepared to target variability in mineral grain sizes and serpentine speciation. The samples were subjected to Davis Tube testwork by grinding the samples and passing them through a magnet with wash water. The recovered magnetic fraction was then characterized as the \"Davis Tube Recoverable\" or \"DTR\" fraction. The test results summarized in Table 2 show DTR grades ranging from 0.07-0.15% nickel and 2.6-3.6% iron. There is potential to increase the DTR grades through finer grinding as the primary grind size of ~190 µm was coarser than what has been reported by others (e.g., 75 µm).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Table 2.

data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"/></span></strong>This press release includes measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company utilizes these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate operating performance on a consistent basis. These measures may also be used when making decisions regarding resource allocation and in determining incentive compensation. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results and business trends relative to past performance and the Company's competitors. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP measures in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Transform and Modernize (T&amp;M) Initiative <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company announced a multi-year T&amp;M initiative. In presenting non-GAAP measures, the Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) expenses for this initiative that are non-recurring, which are primarily project-based external consulting fees and expenses related to supply chain and portfolio optimization (e.g., asset write-offs, severance, or relocation-related costs). The Company believes that non-recurring costs associated with the T&amp;M initiative are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating cost structure; therefore, the Company is excluding these discrete costs. The Company does not adjust for (i.e., does not exclude) certain costs related to the T&amp;M initiative that are expected to continue after the project ends, such as software license fees and internal employee expenses, because those costs are considered ongoing in nature as a component of normal operating costs. The Company also does not adjust for savings realized through the T&amp;M initiative as these are considered ongoing in nature and reflective of expected future operating performance.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Gain or Loss on Sale of Business <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company sold 51% of its equity interest in Justin's, LLC, resulting in a gain on the sale. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company sold Mountain Prairie, LLC, a non-core sow operation, resulting in a loss on the sale. The Company believes the one-time impacts from these sales are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating cost structure, are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance, and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods. Thus, the Company has adjusted for (i.e., excluded) these impacts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Legal Matters <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>From time to time, the Company receives proceeds or incurs expenses related to discrete legal matters that the Company believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance, do not reflect expected future operating income or costs, and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods. The Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) these impacts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Litigation Settlements <br data-v-370fea16=\"\"/></em>In fiscal 2025, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a plaintiff in a pending antitrust litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Corporate Restructuring Plan <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company commenced a corporate restructuring plan, the focus of which is to reduce administrative expenses, improve efficiencies, and align the workforce to the Company's future needs, while enabling continued investment in the Company's growth. The costs incurred to execute the corporate restructuring plan and the charges incurred under the program are primarily related to severance and employee benefit costs. Because the Company believes the charges incurred under the corporate restructuring plan do not reflect future operating costs and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods, the Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) these impacts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Consulting Agreement <br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>On October 27, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement with its former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), pursuant to which the former CEO is expected to provide consulting services to the Company until April 2027. Consulting costs related to the agreement include cash and share-based compensation, which were primarily recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The Company believes non-recurring costs associated with the consulting agreement are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating cost structure, are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance, and are not meaningful when comparing the Company's operating performance against that of prior periods; therefore, the Company is excluding these discrete costs.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The tables below show the calculations to reconcile from the GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures presented in this press release.
