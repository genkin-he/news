Physically, he is not able to live independently, but was or is pretty sharp mentally. We take care of all his bills; his house and car were sold over three years ago. His wife died in 2020; they had no children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 10 days, he started calling my sister about bills he needed to pay; all his bills are being paid by her. He also wants to know the balance in his bank accounts. My sister has always given him this information when he asks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He wanted to see the lawyer recently. He was very paranoid, asking staff to witness their conversation. He doesn't remember that he sold his house or car. In an email, his lawyer said, \"He's gone off the deep end.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lawyer's last words to us were we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate. My sister and I are his only family, the will is made and we would inherit his estate. What do we do next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Other Sibling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Sibling, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm not encouraged by the tone or content of his attorney's email. It lacks compassion, professionalism and respect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother is confused and needs help. But he doesn't need an executor. An executor is appointed by the probate court after your brother passes away (and would typically be designated executor in his will). A power of attorney usually looks after a person's finances while they have diminished capacity; a durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. A conservator/guardian would be appointed by the courts to oversee his financial, physical and medical wellbeing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Take immediate steps to safeguard your brother's safety: He may need an assessment for dementia or cognitive impairment from a neurologist or geriatrician. I hope that the assisted-living facility is aware of this change of behavior, and is equipped to help him navigate this next stage. You will all need to work together until you figure out the next steps for your brother. Questions remain: What kind of power of attorney document currently exists? What legal capacity does your brother have to make decisions for himself - everything from hiring a new lawyer to revoking a POA? Has your brother been actually diagnosed with dementia? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, you will require health advocates and a competent lawyer. If the lawyer mentioned in your letter is not equipped to deal with your brother's situation - and it could be so given his reaction to the decline in your brother's health - you need a new lawyer to oversee your brother's affairs; as his joint powers of attorney, you can help him to appoint one. They will be able to help outline your options, which will depend on what kind of POA you hold and whether or not your brother requires conservatorship/guardianship, which should be a last resort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Laws regarding a conservator/guardian vary by state. In Texas, you would need to file a petition with the court. \"A hearing will be held, and the judge will examine the evidence and make a decision,\" says Childs Legacy Law Firm in Houston. \"In the second instance, absent a pending petition, and in lieu of a family member, living will or another relevant document, the court will appoint a conservator. The conservator can be any number of people, like a friend, social worker, neighbor, church member, attorney, nurse [or] another qualified person.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     General conservatorship </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A general conservatorship is created when an adult - typically an elderly person but can be a younger adult person - cannot manage their finances or health due to deteriorated mental capacity or impairment caused by an illness or injury,\" it adds. \"While they recover from the illness or injury, a conservator may be appointed by a court to address their medical and financial needs.\" Reasons include a person falling into a coma, a form of dementia like Alzheimer's, head injury or a stroke that impairs their ability to think or express their wishes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating, quite suddenly. \"People who suffer from any of the above can become vulnerable to bad actors who may try to manipulate the situation for their own financial gain. These bad actors may, for example, attempt to divert your disability payments (fraud) or coerce you into changing a will (undue influence),\" the law firm says. It is always better to draft an estate plan while you have the legal capacity to write and sign such a document. Otherwise, it will be left up to the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating. He needs calm and legal protection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, your brother needs reassurance and validation, clear and comforting communication, a routine so he feels safe, and legal protection; document everything, especially his changes in behavior. If he does not already have a healthcare proxy or healthcare power of attorney, and your brother is not of sound mind, the courts will appoint one for him. If he is in assisted living, for example, there may come a time when you will have to move him to a full-time care facility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the absence of long-term-care insurance or Medicaid, I assume you will use (or have used) the proceeds from the sale of his house to pay for his care. Selling a primary residence turns the home's equity from an exempt asset into countable cash, which often exceeds the strict monthly $2,000-$3,000 individual limit for Medicaid, which would lead to a temporary loss of benefits until those funds are spent. A trust and estate attorney can talk through your options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can do this.

L3Harris is investing billions of dollars into modernizing and expanding its sites across the nation to significantly increase solid rocket motor production, including for Munitions Acceleration Council programs.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Thank you for being the backbone of our department and our great nation, for having the backs of our warfighters because what you build right here in Camden is absolutely central to the 21st Century Arsenal of Freedom,” Secretary Hegseth said. “You are the patriots ensuring that our warriors are never, ever in a fair fight. The more than 115,000 solid rocket motors that you’re building every single year can’t be matched.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Industrial capacity has become a strategic element of deterrence; the ability to deliver at scale, with speed and reliability, directly impacts how effectively the United States can deter threats and project peace through strength,” said Christopher Kubasik, Chairman and CEO, L3Harris. “Thank you, Secretary Hegseth, for reinforcing to our Camden team that what L3Harris builds here directly contributes to the safety of our warfighters and our homeland.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDuring the visit, Secretary Hegseth engaged employees who produce the propulsion systems that power the PAC-3 air and missile defense system and met with the teams who manufacture the large solid rocket motors for strategic deterrence, interceptors, hypersonic systems and target missiles. He also reviewed construction progress on the company’s new Arkansas Advanced Propulsion Facilities (AAPF).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe AAPF facilities are an expansive new campus that will support medium and large solid rocket motor production. The 110-acre campus will include more than 20 new buildings and increase large solid rocket motor manufacturing capacity sixfold. The expansion incorporates advanced manufacturing technologies, automation and digital process controls L3Harris designed to improve safety, efficiency and throughput while providing long-term, domestic surge capacity.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Camden site produces thousands of solid rocket motors a year that support a wide range of Department of War programs. L3Harris is investing billions in this competitive market to deliver at the scale and speed the Department of War demands. The company’s 2,000-acre Camden site is one of the nation’s largest solid rocket motor manufacturing centers and has supported national and allied defense missions for more than four decades.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nL3Harris acquired the solid rocket motor business in 2023 and has transformed and grown its production operations to align with the Department of War’s increasing demand for missile programs.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Joseph Adinolfi, Joy Wiltermuth and Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A plethora of issues pushed U.S. stocks lower in the final trading session of a rough month </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 stumbled amid a turbulent February for stocks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks were caught up Friday in a whirlwind of market-moving headlines, making for a wild final trading day in a rough month for U.S. equities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The penultimate day of February saw President Trump signal that the U.S. military remains ready to strike Iran. There also were more problems on the inflation and private-credit fronts, with shares of financial stocks - banks and asset managers alike - selling off hard. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors largely blamed the collapse of U.K.-based mortgage lender Market Financial Solutions for reviving fears about more \"cockroaches\" to come in the private-credit industry. But there was also an announcement from Apollo Global Management (APO) that it had reduced a dividend at a private-credit fund and re-evaluated some asset values due to challenges with its loan portfolio. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index BKX fell nearly 5% to cap off the month. Shares of Blue Owl Capital (OWL) fell nearly 6%, while Apollo's stock was down more than 8%, FactSet data showed. Blue Owl spooked investors earlier in February when it limited investor withdrawals and sold $1.4 billion in private-credit assets, including some software loans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other issues for investors arrived ahead of the opening bell, including a troubling inflation report that showed wholesale prices rose by 0.5% in January - faster than the 0.3% increase economists had expected. Meanwhile, what some have called the artificial-intelligence \"fear trade\" remained in full effect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Investors are readjusting their risk budget right now in a risk-off mood on Friday, and that the AI momentum is now becoming AI anxiety,\" said Brian Mulberry, chief market strategist at Zacks Investment Management. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A 'shoot first, ask questions later' market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Software stocks and megacap technology players like Nvidia (NVDA) continued to struggle on Friday, adding to their already punishing losses over the past month. This time, semiconductor stocks - particularly highflying memory names like Sandisk (SNDK) and Micron Technology (MU), which have soared recently while software has plunged - joined in the selling as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks trading outside of the U.S. mostly continued to trundle higher in February, with big gains particularly in the South Korean market. But in the U.S., a dour mood has been underscored by a couple of apparent contradictions, as Jay Hatfield, a portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, pointed out during a conversation with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, sentiment in certain corners of the market has soured dramatically, even though the S&amp;P 500 SPX finished Friday roughly 2 percentage points shy of record territory. Second, there are seemingly contradictory narratives causing havoc within the technology sector, the largest and most important sector for the U.S. equity market's overall stability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Megacap tech stocks are struggling as investors balk at the massive spending on AI infrastructure, seemingly worried about the possibility that the return on investment might be too weak to justify the tremendous cost. Recent earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) elicited negative reactions from investors, while even blockbuster earnings from Nvidia earlier this week weren't enough to turn the tide. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, fears that AI might be so successful it turns whole industries on their heads have hammered shares of software companies, asset managers, commercial real-estate and brokerage firms, cybersecurity companies, and even transportation and logistics firms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"These ideas don't even make sense internally - but they're all out there, and all of these companies are going down,\" Hatfield told MarketWatch Friday. \"This is a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of market.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A Substack post penned by Citrini Research that went viral Monday was widely credited with inspiring the worst selloff in stocks in three weeks. The report envisioned an economy in 2028 where AI is successful enough to cause widespread white-collar job destruction, without new industries emerging to absorb displaced workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"AI has been disrupting a different segment of the economy on a daily basis,\" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at Citizens Wealth, in a phone interview Friday. He noted that \"the narrative has been shifting\" away from talk of huge productivity gains from AI to worries over potential job losses and damage to the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A puzzling bid for bonds </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There also has been a sudden bid for bonds. Instead of Treasury yields rising on signs that inflation might be rearing back up, the benchmark 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipped below the 4% threshold on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation can be kryptonite for bonds. But lately, inflation and the timing of any future Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts have taken a backseat to investors seeking safety from the selloff in software names, said Sweta Singh, a portfolio manager at City Different Investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's the legacy [software-as-a-service] scared money that is being parked into the Treasury market,\" Singh told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This dynamic has also helped bonds shrug off the Supreme Court's decision to rule most of President Trump's tariffs illegal, Singh noted. The ruling raised new questions about the size of U.S. fiscal deficits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In other haven plays, the U.S. dollar DXY failed to gain ground Friday against a basket of rival currencies, despite Trump saying he would \"love not to\" attack Iran. Yet gold (GC00,) which global central banks have been stockpiling as a dollar alternative, has been playing second fiddle to silver (SI00) as investors grow more nervous about a splintering world order. Both metals saw their largest monthly gains on record in February, Dow Jones Market Data showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A \"panic\" rotation has also helped boost shares of defensive stocks in the consumer-staples sector. Investors trawling for value stocks have also boosted shares of energy and materials names. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: February's 'panic' rotation in stocks sets the stage for more tumult in March </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP finished in the red on Friday, and both indexes capped off their worst monthly drop since March 2025, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

(\"Algo Grande\") (TSXV:ALGR)(OTC:KNDYF)(FRA:KM00) announces the closing of its previously announced non-brokered private placement and the election of three new directors at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Pursuant to its news releases dated February 11, 2026 and February 19, 2026, the Company has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\"), at a deemed price of $0.65 per Share. The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,524,063.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's 100%-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of $169,605.44, being equal to 7% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to 7% of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of $0.65 per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of $50,000 (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of $0.65 per Share.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Raymond Jannas</p></li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Hunter Scharfe</p></li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Enrico Gay</p></li></ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $50,150.75 in the Offering. The Insiders' participation constitutes a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions</em> (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than 25% of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States.

The 5,895-hectare Adelita Project is anchored by the high-grade Cerro Grande Cu-Au-Ag skarn discovery, which exhibits strong continuity along a defined corridor extending over 6 kilometers. Reprocessing of legacy geophysical data and field mapping indicate the presence of a potential porphyry system at depth, suggesting a classic skarn-porphyry mineralization model similar to major deposits found throughout northwestern Mexico.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">ON BEHALF OF ALGO GRANDE COPPER CORP.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Enrico Gay<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Chief Executive Officer</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information, please contact:</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">E-mail: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:info@algo-grande.com\" tabindex=\"0\">info@algo-grande.com</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Website: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://pr.report/j58y\" tabindex=\"0\">www.algo-grande.com</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">NEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">This news release contains statements and information that, to the extent that they are not historical fact, constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.
