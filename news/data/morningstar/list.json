            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Ed Frankl </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The eurozone economy grew more than expected in the three months through September as it adjusted to higher U.S. tariffs, and recent surveys show tentative signs of a German-led recovery as a tumultuous year draws to a close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Gross domestic product in the 20-nation eurozone increased 0.2% in the third quarter, compared with a 0.1% rise in the second, and a 0.6% jump in the first, European Union data agency Eurostat said Thursday. Annualized eurozone growth was 0.9%, from 0.5% in second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That was a little better than expectations from a consensus of economists, but still reflects the drag on economic growth from weaker exports to the U.S. after President Trump ramped up tariffs at the start of the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  There are some signs of a revival as the adjustment to higher tariffs on eurozone exports advances. The area's composite purchasing managers' index, which tracks around 5,000 companies in the manufacturing and services sectors, showed activity among private-sector companies strengthened to a 17-month high as the fourth quarter got underway. The European Commission's business and consumer survey showed economic sentiment also drove higher this month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A revival in Germany drove that pickup, and the country's Ifo Institute survey of business sentiment improved in October. That suggests activity might increase in the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"For those looking at this from a glass-half-full perspective, the eurozone has remained far from recession despite all the global and domestic turmoil,\" ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But the half-empty take would be that evidence of sustained growth acceleration on the back of extra investment promises isn't there yet, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Germany's economy has borne the brunt of the higher tariffs, since it relies more heavily than other large eurozone economies on exports and manufacturing. The eurozone's largest economy narrowly avoided a slide into recession in the three months through September, extending a period of weak expansion that dates back to before the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But with the government having announced and now implementing a big increase in spending on defense and a repair of frayed infrastructure, there are hopes of a revival. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  German arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall have seen share prices soar amid promises over defense spending, and as the U.S. talks down its NATO commitments despite war continuing in Ukraine. Munich has become a growing military-tech hub, and factories that previously made cars are set to be repurposed as production lines for weapons. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The EU also earlier this year pledged to mobilize as much as 800 billion euros ($928.12 billion) as part of its own rearmament program up to the end of the decade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Yet the biggest driver of growth could be German investment in infrastructure--as much as 500 billion euros for creaking railways and green-energy transition programs--which is less subject to being redirected to military imports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  However, the eurozone's economy is unlikely to grow strongly without a rise in consumer spending, which has been subdued over recent years. Europeans continue to save more than before the pandemic, reflecting the uncertainty they have faced as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and then the U.S. subjected their industries to higher trade barriers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"In Europe, purchasing power has improved, the labor market is strong across multiple countries, inflation has come down, but household sentiment is still not great,\" said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist of BNP Paribas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But as time passes and people realize they have more money in their pockets and in their bank accounts, and that they still have a job, spending should accelerate again, she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The ECB expects a series of cuts in borrowing costs will help revive household spending and business investment. But its president Christine Lagarde has said repeatedly that the central bank is in a \"good place\", and the third-quarter pickup in growth is likely to cement expectations that the key rate will settle around its current 2% level for some time. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Ed Frankl at edward.frankl@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 30, 2025 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Comcast didn't lose as many broadband subscribers as Wall Street feared but still faces competitive pressures </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Comcast has been growing its wireless business while facing subscriber pressure in its broadband business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Comcast Corp. is still shedding broadband subscribers, but not as many as Wall Street feared. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The media and telecommunications giant on Thursday reported a net loss of 104,000 domestic internet customers for the third quarter, reflecting losses of 91,000 in its residential segment and 13,000 in its business segment. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting 143,000 domestic broadband net losses on average, versus 226,000 in the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On an absolute basis, the subscriber losses pale in comparison to the size of Comcast's (CMCSA) broadband base, which stood at 31.4 million subscribers in the third quarter. But since broadband is a major contributor to Comcast's profit, subscriber trends generate outsize attention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's especially been true in a tough competitive climate. Wireless companies like AT&amp;T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) have been betting big on fiber offerings that have resonated with customers. And fixed-wireless-access services from Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) are clicking as well. Together, those technologies have become persistent thorns in Comcast's side, and a reason for sustained subscriber losses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The issue has weighed on Comcast's stock, which is down 24% so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has advanced 17%. The stock is up 2% in Thursday's premarket action. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Should Comcast split into three? This analyst says a breakup would mean big upside </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Comcast is also losing video subscribers - a net of 257,000 in the third quarter - but it's been making inroads in wireless. The company is a mobile virtual network operator that leverages Verizon's network but is the face of plans sold to customers. Comcast added 414,000 net wireless lines in the third quarter and offers bundled deals to customers who use its other connectivity services. The company said the wireless figure was its best quarterly result on record. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On a financial basis, Comcast topped expectations in the latest quarter. It posted $31.2 billion in revenue, above the FactSet consensus of $30.7 billion, along with $1.12 in adjusted earnings per share. Analysts had been looking for $1.10 in adjusted EPS. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Comcast's theme-park business generated $2.7 billion in revenue, with CEO Brian Roberts calling out \"the early success of Epic Universe\" and \"the enduring appeal of the Universal brand.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: The biggest highlight from Verizon's earnings report isn't a number </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

after the meeting with Xi. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prices settled higher in the previous session, lifted by a larger-than-anticipated draw in crude

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano sold his Fiserv shares for at least $500 million. The stock fell 44% on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Frank Bisignano, in matching wardrobe, looks on as Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office in August. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The crisis swamping Fiserv should raise fresh questions about Donald Trump's Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was running the payments company until just a few months ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fiserv's stock (FI) immediately collapsed by more than 40% early Wednesday as the company's new leaders shocked Wall Street with news of a plummeting financial outlook and past management errors and ended the day down 44%. CEO Mike Lyons, who took over from Bisignano in May, delivered before analysts and investors a brutal takedown of the Milwaukee-based company's failings under the leadership of the man now in charge of Social Security. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bisignano was the CEO of Fiserv for five years, from 2020 to this year, and chairman, as well, for the past three. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sales forecasts made in recent years \"would have been objectively difficult to achieve even with the right investment and strong execution,\" Lyons told analysts and investors Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation: Under Bisignano, the company made forecasts it could not plausibly have achieved. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Management made \"decisions to defer certain investments and cut certain costs [which] improved margins in the short term but are now limiting our ability to serve clients in a world-class way, execute product launches to our standards and grow revenue to our full potential.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation: Bisignano relied on short-term cost cutting, to the detriment of the company's long-term health. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And, in recent years, quarterly earnings results \"increasingly relied on short-term initiatives,\" said Lyons, who joined Fiserv as CEO-in-waiting in January from PNC, where he'd been president since 2024. Those initiatives, Lyons said, placed \"too much emphasis on pursuing in-quarter results as opposed to building long-term relationships by prioritizing business that both meets our clients' needs and comes with high recurring revenue.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation: Bisignano was chasing short-term quarterly results, not building the business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oh, and Lyons pointedly promised the Street that Fiserv was now \"on our way back to the highest standards.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Translation? You got it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not unusual for a new boss to blame the old boss for lingering problems. But in the case of Firserv, the stock is now down 64% in 2025, and Lyons became CEO five months in. Something was obviously wrong at the company before he took over. The stock is changing hands for less today than what it was worth when Bisignano became CEO in 2000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The revelations, especially on costs, may cause America's seniors some unease. Trump put Bisignano in charge of the Social Security Administration in May, tasking him with \"turning it around.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This guy's amazing,\" Trump said of Bisignano in August during an Oval Office press conference. \"It's sort of what he does. He takes troubled entities and turns them around.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The president added, \"He did some of the biggest messes in the world.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those now nursing massive losses on Fiserv's stock may ruefully agree, although the president presumably meant listeners to understand Bisignano as having fixed messes rather than having created them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Social Security chief tapped to oversee another struggling agency: the IRS </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While investors and analysts will debate the current situation at Fiserv and may not agree on whom to blame, crises of this scale rarely come out of nowhere. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before leaving the company in May to join the administration, as recently as February, Bisignano was bragging to Wall Street investors about the company's stellar performance and its great outlook. The stock price back then was $230. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now? $70.60. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They say it's better to be lucky than to be smart, and cynics may now wonder which word is a better fit for Bisignano. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The latest: Fiserv attracted hot money ahead of 44% stock-price nosedive </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He didn't just get out of Fiserv before the collapse. He also sold all of his stock before the price plunged. And he was able to use a government loophole that has allowed him to avoid capital-gains tax on those stock sales, potentially forever. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lucky? Smart? You make the call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Joining the administration legally required (or, a cynic might say, enabled) Bisignano - seconded just this month to a newly created CEO post at the IRS - to dump all of his stock quickly to comply with ethics rules and without alarming the Street. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As of Feb. 28 of this year, Bisignano owned in total 3,176,650 shares, according to securities filings. He sold between mid-May and early July, his government ethics filings show. During that time the price ranged between $157.57 and $177.36, according to MarketWach data. That means that Bisignano, a Trump campaign backer, sold the shares for at least $500 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Today, at a share price below $71, they'd be worth $225 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The difference (that is, the avoided loss of value): at least $275 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to the company's proxy statement, Bisignano also held nearly 400,000 \"unvested stock units,\" potentially worth up to $70 million more at the May and June stock prices, though it is unclear which, if any, he received before leaving the company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Government ethics filings don't show exactly how much appointees raise when they sell their stocks. Instead they give ranges. The filings show 22 separate transactions between May 16 and July 1, with a range of between $240 million and $610 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ordinarily when you sell stock for millions, let alone hundreds of millions, you are expected to pay capital-gains tax on the profits at a rate of up to 20% for long-term holdings (with short-term holdings taxed at ordinary marginal income-tax rates). A $500 million sale of long-term holdings would result in a tax bill of up to $100 million, depending on how much you paid for the stock in the first place. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But under a law signed by the first President George Bush, executives who join an administration and who are required to sell their stock to avoid conflicts of interest get a freebie. They can sell their stock and defer capital-gains tax, potentially forever, so long as they use the proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio or buy Treasury securities. Section 1043 of the Internal Revenue Code makes perfect sense if you consider that the executive branch may want to recruit top leaders from business, and it will hardly help attract them if they are billed vast sums in needless capital-gains tax in order to join the government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the rule also means that some people can sidestep huge tax bills with a job in the executive branch, even if they serve only briefly. Which means it is also wide open to exploitation by people who are either smart or lucky. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Social Security Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The ProVE <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">SL</em> platform allows researchers to load their own peptides and flexibly combine monomers with a wide range of avidin or streptavidin conjugates—including fluorescent, barcoded, or mass-cytometry reagents—to easily create tetramers or surface-bound complexes. This flexibility enables faster experimental setup, reconfiguration of panels, expanded donor-cohort coverage, including less common alleles, and integration with advanced flow and mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing workflows.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nT cell immunology, epitope mapping and immune-monitoring workflows increasingly demand reagents that permit rapid customisation across diverse HLA contexts.
