Saefong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The crude-oil market is seeing a 'rare occasion' where supply risks are more focused on the Americas </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Any potential U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites could pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power - and that raises significant risks for oil markets, said the Price Futures Group's Phil Flynn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Escalating U.S. tensions with Venezuela and an upcoming monthly decision by major oil producers on crude output targets were the focus of traders heading into the weekend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. plans to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment, the Miami Herald reported Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In response to the report, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told MarketWatch in an email that \"unnamed sources don't know what they're talking about. Any announcements regarding Venezuela policy would come directly from the President.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, oil prices found some support in the wake of the news report of potential strikes, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery (CLZ25) (CL.1) edging up by 0.6% to $60.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices were still trading lower for the week and have declined for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although the U.S. already has certain sanctions on Venezuela in place, \"those do not impact physical [oil] production and transport in the same way that possible damage from military activity could,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \"So this appears to be forcing investors to adjust their supply-risk expectations.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is a \"rare occasion,\" Cieszynski noted, where \"supply risks are more focused in the Americas.\" He pointed out that U.S. crude prices were up a bit more than global benchmark Brent crude, which saw its January contract (BRNF26) - which becomes the front month at the end of the session - move up by 0.4% to $64.62 on ICE Futures Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites would potentially pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \"This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The situation, meanwhile, could overshadow concerns about the recent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft Oil Company and Lukoil OAO, said Flynn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil traders also are anticipating the latest decision by the major oil producers known as OPEC+ over the weekend. The group plans to hold its monthly meeting on Sunday and is expected to decide on production targets for the month of December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the last meeting in early October, OPEC+ agreed to increase production in November by another 137,000 barrels a day, despite rising concerns of a global supply glut. The group has been announcing monthly production increases since April. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In 2026, the global oil market may see an average surplus of 4 million barrels per day, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and World Bank Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: An oil supply glut could sink prices to $35 a barrel next year. Why the U.S.-China trade truce won't change that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the short term, analysts were expecting oil officials to announce a similar rise of 137,000 barrels per day in production targets, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But long term, it looks as if the oil market wants to go lower, retesting the double bottom from this past May of $55 front-month WTI, he said in emailed comments to MarketWatch Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The reason is simply the ongoing slowdown in global demand growth, against recent reports that there will be a supply overhang of around 4 million bpd next year,\" said Morrison. \"That could be countered by U.S. sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil, but I don't think traders put much store in the effectiveness of sanctions. Maybe this time it's different.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.

The RBA also faces surging house prices, which argue strongly against easing for now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  With core inflation back at the top of the RBA's target range, some economists are even speculating that the next move in rates will be upward--but not until 2027. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The RBA has only cut rates three times in total and raised them less than many of its global peers, so a shallow easing cycle was always likely. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In New Zealand, third-quarter employment data due Wednesday are expected to show the jobless rate remaining above 5.0%. Despite significant rate cuts over the past year, New Zealand's economy remains weak and employment growth has yet to recover. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has said much of its policy easing has yet to reach households, many of which have fixed mortgage rates.

Looking ahead, Indonesia's trade ties with the U.S. could continue to weigh on the exports due to higher tariffs, while imports may benefit from reciprocal arrangements, UOB economists Enrico Tanuwidjaja and Vincentius Ming Shen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Citi expects October inflation at 2.81% from 2.65% in September, driven by higher food prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Core inflation likely eased to 2.06% from 2.19% amid moderate demand, ANZ said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Bank Indonesia's pro-growth stance suggests the easing cycle isn't over, with ANZ expecting two additional 25-basis-point cuts, bringing the policy rate down to 4.25% by the first quarter of next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Indonesia's statistics bureau will release third-quarter GDP data Wednesday afternoon. Growth likely eased to 5.0% from 5.12% in the prior quarter, ANZ said. Indicators point to weaker consumer confidence, slower car sales, moderated loan growth, softer capital goods imports and budget disbursement delays, it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Net exports likely provided some support, while fourth-quarter stimulus measures worth 46 trillion rupiah, equivalent to 0.2% of GDP, should help boost private consumption, ANZ added. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  South Korea </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  South Korea is due to release its October inflation data Tuesday. Headline inflation likely picked up marginally, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The median forecast from a WSJ poll of seven economists calls for a 2.2% on-year rise in the benchmark consumer-price index, following a 2.1% gain in September. On a monthly basis, the index likely edged up 0.1% after September's 0.5% increase. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Citigroup economist Jin-Wook Kim said inflationary pressure from higher agricultural products during the early-October Chuseok holiday may have eased somewhat, while Shinyoung Securities economist Cho Yong-gu said higher prices for industrial goods and utility likely kept overall inflation elevated. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Taiwan </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Taiwan reports trade data on Friday, which will show if the island's run of exports growth continued at the start of the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Frontloading of shipments to get ahead of U.S. tariffs, plus booming demand for the chips and electronics, have powered Taiwan's exports through the year, lifting the outlook for the broader economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Some economists have expected that momentum to correct somewhat in the second half of the year. DBS's economics team thinks exports growth likely slowed but stayed solid at about 30% on year as the delay in U.S. semiconductor tariffs encouraged frontloading and AI-related demand remained strong. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The trade data will be preceded by inflation figures for October that will likely show an uptick in price growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Economists at HSBC point out the pullback in September was down to tax cuts, and the timing of the Mid-Autumn festival. The holiday, which fell later this year, will likely push inflation higher in October. A temporary hike in household electricity fees likely also drove up inflation. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Philippines </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Investors will focus on the Philippines' inflation and GDP data for signs of how policy easing and fiscal spending are filtering through the economy. Rice prices likely rose slightly in October, driving headline inflation higher, Barclays said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Third-quarter GDP growth likely slowed sharply due to a significant decline in government spending, ING said, citing corruption scandals associated with flood-control projects. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Business sentiment also weakened, with tariff uncertainties adding further drag, ING added. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Thailand </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Thailand will release its October inflation data during the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Consumer prices likely turned more negative, ANZ said, following government measures to cut retail diesel and gasoline prices and lower raw material costs amid favorable weather conditions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While prices of some items may have risen, HSBC economists expect price pressures to remain soft, with consumer demand still cooling on the back of high household debt and subdued confidence. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Any references to days are in local times. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Jessica Fleetham at jessica.fleetham@wsj.com and Jihye Lee at jihye.lee@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 12:59 ET (16:59 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

All eyes will also be on whether U.S. lawmakers can agree to end the government shutdown, which prevents the release of key economic data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Elsewhere, focus will center on central bank interest-rate decisions in the U.K. and Australia, as well as a number of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Sweden, Norway and Malaysia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  In Asia, purchasing managers' surveys, including from China, will be closely watched as U.S. trade policy continues to set the tone for the region. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  U.S. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Upcoming U.S. economic data will be scrutinized after the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as expected, but Chair Jerome Powell said a follow-up rate reduction in December wasn't a foregone conclusion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Investors will, therefore, be looking for any evidence of weakness in the labor market or evidence that inflation is slowing, which could increase prospects of a December rate cut. Investors are less sure about prospects for December's meeting after the latest Fed announcement, with money markets currently pricing in a 68% chance of another rate reduction then. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  If the U.S. government shutdown continues, however, this will mean official data, including key U.S. jobs figures, will still not be released. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Investors will, therefore, focus closely on private-sector data, notably the ISM surveys on manufacturing activity in October due on Monday and on services activity due on Wednesday, as well as ADP private payrolls figures on Wednesday and University of Michigan's preliminary consumer survey for November on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  These \"will be more closely watched than usual for indications on the health of the labour market and inflationary pressures,\" HSBC economists said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Meanwhile, markets will await any news when the government could be reopened. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Scheduled data which won't be released unless the government reopens include trade data and factory orders figures on Tuesday, weekly jobless claims figures Thursday and monthly jobs data on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  There are no Treasury auctions but the quarterly refunding announcement is due on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The U.S. Treasury is set to hold auction sizes steady for a seventh consecutive quarter at the November refunding announcement on Nov. 5, TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg and Jan Nevruzi said in a note. The U.S. rates strategists don't expect auction size increases until at least late 2026, with the Treasury likely keeping guidance unchanged. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canada </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canadian jobs data for October on Friday will be closely watched as investors look for any evidence of growing weakness in the Canadian economy that could prompt the central bank to cut interest rates again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of Canada cut interest rates at its latest meeting but signaled that rates were likely to stay on hold for now. Still, recent gross domestic product data for August were weaker than expected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The latest rate cut will likely be the last one in the current cycle, but if the economy or labor market weakens more than expected the central bank could trim rates a little further, Oxford Economics' Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport said in a note. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Latin America </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Brazil's central bank announces a rate decision on Wednesday and is expected to leave rates unchanged at 15.00%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"The gradual and steady re-anchoring process of inflation expectations and the current domestic slowdown are likely to continue improving the inflation outlook going forward,\" Citi analysts said in a note. They expect the central bank to begin gradually lowering rates in the first quarter of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Mexico's central bank is also set to announce a decision on Thursday, where it is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in order to bolster the economy, taking the key interest rate down to 7.25%. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Eurozone </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A quiet week in data follows the European Central Bank's policy meeting, where rates were left unchanged amid a relatively upbeat view on the eurozone's growth outlook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone final manufacturing purchasing managers indexes for October are up for release on Monday, followed by services PMIs on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Germany publishes manufacturing orders data for September on Wednesday and industrial output figures on Thursday. France publishes industrial production data for September on Wednesday, and Spain releases similar data on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Eurozone retail sales data are due on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Germany will sell the December 2027 Schatz on Tuesday, as well as May 2041 and July 2044 Bunds on Wednesday. Other sovereign-bond issuers are Austria on Tuesday, and Spain and France on Thursday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  U.K. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Market focus will be on the Bank of England interest rate decision due on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central bank is broadly expected to keep interest rates on hold at 4.0%, particularly ahead of the government's budget announcement on Nov. 26. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  However, some analysts expect that rates could be cut by 25 basis points, or at least that the decision will be a close call, following recent weaker-than-expected U.K. inflation and jobs data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"We see a clear, although narrow path, to pave the way for a cut at the November meeting,\" said Danske Bank's Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  U.K. money markets price a 31% chance of a rate cut at this upcoming meeting, LSEG data show. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Economic data during the week include final purchasing managers' data on manufacturing on Monday and on services on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Bank of England will also release its quarterly monetary policy report, where it will outline forecasts for inflation and the economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The U.K. plans to sell 5 billion pounds in May 2029 gilt on Tuesday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Scandinavia </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sweden's Riksbank announces an interest-rate decision on Wednesday, followed by a decision by Norway's Norges Bank on Thursday, with both expected to hold rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Riksbank is expected to leave its policy rate at 1.75%. ING analyst Francesco Pesole said in a note that solid Swedish economic growth argues against the Riksbank cutting interest rates again any time soon. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Norges Bank is also expected to keep rates on hold at 4.0%, confirming it is in no hurry to increase rates further. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Denmark and Sweden will hold bond auctions on Wednesday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Poland </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Poland's central bank will announce a policy decision on Wednesday where another interest-rate cut is widely expected. Market pricing implies an 85% chance of another 25 basis points rate cut to 4.25%, LSEG data show. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  At the October meeting, the central bank unexpectedly cut rates by 25 basis. It marked the fourth cut this year and came after inflation held at 2.9% in September, coming in below expectations. Data Friday showed inflation eased to 2.8% in October, strengthening the case for further rate cuts. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Czech Republic </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Czech National Bank announces its latest interest-rate decision on Thursday. Markets are pricing a 65% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged at 3.5% and a 35% chance of a 25 basis-point cut, LSEG data show. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  While inflation eased to 2% in September, stronger-than-expected economic growth data argues that the central bank should be cautious about cutting rates, ING analyst Chris Turner said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"The economy is growing at its fastest pace since the Covid rebound, and at the same time, wages are showing upside, which will keep core inflation higher,\" he said. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Switzerland </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Switzerland releases consumer-price inflation data for October on Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Japan </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan will release minutes from its September meeting that will shed light into the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. At that meeting, two board members proposed hiking the policy rate to 0.75%, a proposal that was ultimately defeated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Japan's finance ministry is set to auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year Japanese Government bonds on Wednesday. The sale could draw strong demand from investors following BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda's recent comments after the central bank held rates steady again in October. He said he sees no risk of Japan falling behind the policy curve, suggesting the BOJ is in no rush to tighten policy settings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  He also said the central bank wants to further assess wage growth momentum and review more economic data before considering rate increases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a national holiday. Auto sale figures for October, a gauge of consumer demand, are due Tuesday, while household spending data will be released Friday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  China </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Markets will focus on a fresh batch of economic data from China following the recent easing of U.S.-China trade tensions. The two countries' leaders recently held their first face-to-face meeting in six years, agreeing to a temporary truce that included lowering tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A private gauge for factory activity for the month of October--compiled before the meeting-is expected to show a slowdown in momentum. The RatingDog manufacturing PMI, due Monday, is likely to have edged down to 50.0 from 51.2 in September amid slowing export growth, Nomura analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Capital Economics' Zichun Huang noted that while private PMI readings have been stronger than official data recently, \"the message is likely to be that growth momentum remains subdued, and we don't expect that to change in the coming quarters.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  China is also set to release October trade data on Friday. Nomura analysts expect export growth to slow sharply to 3.0% on year from 8.3% in September and import growth to ease to 5.0% from 7.4%, marginally widening the trade surplus to $94 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  ANZ's Raymond Yeung projects exports and imports growth of just 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms, citing fewer working days during the month and a high base last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  China's foreign-exchange reserves data is also scheduled for release during the week. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 12:59 ET (16:59 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

(Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     YouTube is feeling the downside of its increasing importance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As the streamer has seen its position grow, it has found itself engaged in a series of bruising fights over carriage fees with several major television companies - which has reached a pinnacle with a blackout of programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney's channels were removed from YouTube's pay-TV platform late Thursday after the media giant failed to reach an agreement with YouTube TV, which is owned by Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google, over payments for programming rights. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney's stock gained 0.3% in recent midday trading, while Alphabet shares pulled back 0.4% from the previous session's record close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Negotiations continue, but it's unclear when Disney's programming might resume. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's a modern twist on an old kind of fight. For years, channels would temporarily disappear from cable services amid fights over carriage fees, or what carriers pay television companies for the rights to show their programming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now it has migrated into streaming, with YouTube TV becoming a prime battleground. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     YouTube argues that Disney's move to pull its programming was aimed at steering viewers to its own streaming platforms, ESPN+, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube wrote in a note to its customers. Subscribers were offered a $20 credit if the Disney content was unavailable \"for an extended period of time.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disney countered that the fault lies with YouTube TV for \"Refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fight with Disney is the latest in a string of disagreements between YouTube TV and several major television companies. The service, which is popular with viewers looking to watch live programming like sports and news, has previously fought with Fox Corp. (FOX), Comcast Corp.'s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Paramount Skydance Corp. (PSKY) over carriage fees, but had reached last-minute agreements with them before any disruption to programming could occur. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     (Fox Corp. and MarketWatch parent News Corp share common ownership.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A similar fight with TelevisaUnivision (MX:TLEVISACPO) reached an impasse last month, forcing the Spanish-language broadcaster's programming off YouTube TV's platform. That led President Donald Trump to press Google to make a deal and restore TelevisaUnivision's programming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     YouTube has become an increasingly dominant player in the streaming space. Its free platform commands the largest share of audience of any streamer. Its subscription service, which costs $82.99 for the base plan, has about 10 million subscribers and is expected to surpass most traditional pay-TV cable and satellite providers in the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Lukas I.

The milestone underscores growing sponsor demand for quality ocular endpoint protection delivered at the point of need, all backed by secure data workflows that streamline submissions and protect timelines.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAcross its portfolio, 20/20 Onsite has achieved a 95+ patient Net Promoter Score (NPS), 100% screening timelines met, and 85,000+ ophthalmic assessments conducted across 48 states. In verified studies, the company has maintained ~91% patient retention versus an industry Phase 3 average near 70%, helping sponsors reduce re-visits, protect endpoints, and keep programs on schedule.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“CNS and neurology trials can live or die by the consistency and integrity of their ocular endpoints,” said Ivan Quiroz, VP, Clinic Operations, 20/20 Onsite. “Sponsors trust us because we bring certified teams, validated equipment, and a patient-first workflow directly to the point of need—sites, homes, or community locations—so they get high-quality data without adding burden to patients or sites. Our job is to get it done, and get it done right, every time.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Purpose-Built to Protect Ocular Endpoints in Neuro Trials</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n20/20 Onsite’s model pairs field-based ophthalmic experts with validated imaging and exam equipment deployed via mobile vision clinics, mobile vision pods, and mobile clinic suites. This point-of-need approach reduces travel, improves consistency across timepoints, and increases access for underrepresented populations.
