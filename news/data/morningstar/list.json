            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat co-founder also believes Mag 7 and crypto are near bottoms </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat's Tom Lee is calling the end, nearly, of the AI scare trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia delivered solid results, but there's just a smattering of applause so far, and no sign of a rally for Thursday as investors near the end of what has been a tough month for stocks tied to the AI trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also declared \"markets got it wrong\" over the software selloff, so we'll see his view takes hold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You'll find some concurrence with Huang in our call of the day from co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who believes that selloffs for software, Magnificent 7 stocks and crypto are nearly done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee said markets tend to bottom on bad news, flagging the viral AI doom post from Citrini Research that shook up investors at the start of the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I think that we're seeing signs that we could be far along into that bottom,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Mag 7 stocks MAGS have been rising since Feb. 17. Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as he sees the rotation out of those stocks nearing an extreme level. Software is 99% done with a selloff now in the final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the last weeks of a pullback, he says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median monthly average decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That gives way to an even stronger March performance, potentially an average gain of 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement. The current one is up to 90%, so he thinks that process is nearly finished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is known as one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters who correctly told investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market. But he's also made pretty bullish calls on crypto, suggesting last summer that bitcoin could \"easily get to $200,000\" by the end of 2025, and has predicted it could top $1 million in a few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee also weighed in on Nvidia's earnings, pointing to record quarterly revenue and strong net income, plus shares trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, so about half of Costco's (COST) multiple. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's what's necessary to return the incredibly concentrated U.S. stock market to normal levels </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are slipping, with gold (GC00), silver (SI00) and oil (CL00) under pressure. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Key asset performance                                                Last       5d     1m      YTD     1y \n   S&amp;P 500                                                              6946.13    0.94%  -0.46%  1.47%   16.62% \n   Nasdaq Composite                                                     23,152.08  1.75%  -2.96%  -0.39%  21.37% \n   10-year Treasury                                                     4.054      -2.60  -18.60  -11.80  -21.10 \n   Gold                                                                 5203.8     4.16%  -3.83%  20.12%  77.50% \n   Oil                                                                  65.62      1.05%  3.34%   14.30%  -4.65% \n   Data: MarketWatch.

            "title": "Why strategist Tom Lee believes the AI bloodbath and crypto selloff is almost over",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat co-founder also believes Mag 7 and crypto are near bottoms </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fundstrat's Tom Lee is calling the end, nearly, of the AI scare trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia delivered solid results, but there's just a smattering of applause so far, and no sign of a rally for Thursday as investors near the end of what has been a tough month for stocks tied to the AI trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also declared \"markets got it wrong\" over the software selloff, so we'll see his view takes hold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You'll find some concurrence with Huang in our call of the day from co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who believes that selloffs for software, Magnificent 7 stocks and crypto are nearly done. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee said markets tend to bottom on bad news, flagging the viral AI doom post from Citrini Research that shook up investors at the start of the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I think that we're seeing signs that we could be far along into that bottom,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Mag 7 stocks MAGS have been rising since Feb. 17. Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as he sees the rotation out of those stocks nearing an extreme level. Software is 99% done with a selloff now in the final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the last weeks of a pullback, he says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median monthly average decline of 0.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That gives way to an even stronger March performance, potentially an average gain of 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement. The current one is up to 90%, so he thinks that process is nearly finished. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee is known as one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters who correctly told investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market. But he's also made pretty bullish calls on crypto, suggesting last summer that bitcoin could \"easily get to $200,000\" by the end of 2025, and has predicted it could top $1 million in a few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lee also weighed in on Nvidia's earnings, pointing to record quarterly revenue and strong net income, plus shares trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, so about half of Costco's (COST) multiple. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's what's necessary to return the incredibly concentrated U.S. stock market to normal levels </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stock futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are slipping, with gold (GC00), silver (SI00) and oil (CL00) under pressure. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\">   Key asset performance                                                Last       5d     1m      YTD     1y \n   S&amp;P 500                                                              6946.13    0.94%  -0.46%  1.47%   16.62% \n   Nasdaq Composite                                                     23,152.08  1.75%  -2.96%  -0.39%  21.37% \n   10-year Treasury                                                     4.054      -2.60  -18.60  -11.80  -21.10 \n   Gold                                                                 5203.8     4.16%  -3.83%  20.12%  77.50% \n   Oil                                                                  65.62      1.05%  3.34%   14.30%  -4.65% \n   Data: MarketWatch.

The Company possesses fantastic brands and has strong category growth tailwinds at its back. I see a clear path to create tremendous value for our shareholders and intend to make a sizable open-market purchase of Nomad shares in the coming weeks to express my confidence and align my interests with our shareholders. The value creation, however, will not be immediate and we have work to do to unlock our full potential. We have a number of opportunities to address in the organization, and we will be focused on these in the coming months. We continue to streamline the organization to increase our speed, agility, focus and accountability. We believe this will help us improve our commercial execution while unlocking additional resources for reinvestment. We are also ensuring that the right talent, sourced both internally and externally, is in the right roles to help us succeed. We believe we can and will deliver better results, but we anticipate 2026 being a transition year as our financial outlook reflects the time required to implement and manage change. I am excited to show investors what Nomad Foods is capable of once we see the results of our new approach.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Noam Gottesman, Nomad Foods' Co-Chairman and Founder, commented, \"While it has only been a few months, I am encouraged by the rapid changes being implemented at Nomad Foods and the multi-year vision that is beginning to unfold. Dominic and his team have a lot of work ahead of them, but they are starting from a good place. The company's portfolio is strong, category growth is robust and retail-sell out in 2025 delivered modest growth. The opportunity ahead is substantial.

An initial resource for Midlothian was published on December 18, 2025 with 590 million tonnes Inferred at 0.28% nickel. Midlothian, located in the Timmins Nickel District, is also well-positioned to leverage existing regional infrastructure. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">CEO Mark Selby said, \"Today's announcement is another exciting development in the Timmins Nickel District confirming Midlothian as a significant deposit. The strong results across all samples highlight the potential of this resource, which contains significant quantities of awaruite ranging from 0.25-0.36% and has the highest average nickel grade in our portfolio (0.28%) and total nickel grades more than 30% higher than other leading awaruite deposits. Midlothian is emerging as one of the most promising deposits in the District.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Mr. Selby continued, \"We are encouraged by these early results, especially as initial DTR tests were done at coarser grind size than other deposits. A finer grind may yield even higher DTR nickel results. Because the awaruite mineralization has been confirmed to be widespread at Midlothian, the Company plans to assay all existing and future drill holes to allow a DTR nickel resource grade to be calculated in addition to a total recoverable nickel resource.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Midlothian Project</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Midlothian is located 64 kilometres southwest of Timmins and 20 kilometres west of Matachewan, Ontario. It is a large serpentinized ultramafic approximately 2.5 km long and up to 520 metres wide - with a geophysical footprint of 1.7 km<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2</span> (similar to the combined footprint of Crawford's Main and East Zones) - consisting mainly of a highly serpentinized dunite core with minor peridotite and significant awaruite nickel mineralization accounting for up to 79% of the total nickel content.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">An initial total nickel resource estimate was published at the end of 2025 (see news release December 18, 2025) containing an Inferred Resource of 0.59 billion tonnes grading 0.28% nickel for a total of 1.68 million tonnes of nickel. The resource estimate was based on 22 drillholes, where all drillholes were sampled for geochemical analysis at an average rate of one core sample per 1.5 metres. In addition, one sample every twenty core samples was selected and submitted for mineralogical (QEMSCAN) testing.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This release summarizes the mineralogical results for 177 samples from the first 14 of the 22 drillholes (Figure 1), as well as metallurgical results for four separate composite representing different mineralization styles within the deposit (Table 1). The results highlight the thoroughly serpentinized nature of the ultramafics and confirm the different mineral forms in which nickel is hosted. Mineralogical results on the remaining eight holes are pending. The nickel mineralization is dominated by a nickel-iron alloy (awaruite) and minor nickel sulphide (heazlewoodite) Figure 2, Table 1. Both awaruite and heazlewoodite are minerals that have a higher nickel tenor, ranging between 65-75% nickel content.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Brucite, a key mineral indicator for carbon sequestration potential was also identified by QEMSCAN. Midlothian contains significantly higher abundance than both Crawford's East and Main Zones.

The samples were subjected to Davis Tube testwork by grinding the samples and passing them through a magnet with wash water. The recovered magnetic fraction was then characterized as the \"Davis Tube Recoverable\" or \"DTR\" fraction. The test results summarized in Table 2 show DTR grades ranging from 0.07-0.15% nickel and 2.6-3.6% iron. There is potential to increase the DTR grades through finer grinding as the primary grind size of ~190 µm was coarser than what has been reported by others (e.g., 75 µm).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Table 2.
