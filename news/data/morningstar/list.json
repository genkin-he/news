Saefong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reports say Iran's military is not allowing passage through the crucial maritime waterway known as the Strait of Hormuz </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sealing the Straight of Hormuz would be the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre, says SPI Asset Management. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel's attack on Iran raised alarms on Saturday that a key regional source of the world's crude oil may now be at risk, sparking  talk of a return to $100-a-barrel oil prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Strait of Hormuz, a maritime chokepoint vital to the world's crude-oil exports, has come into sharp focus as fears of a broader regional conflict grow. The strait is crucial because it allows cargo ships to pass the Persian Gulf,  the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the production and flow of crude oil from the Middle East. The region is home to five of the world's top 10 biggest producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"So far, there is no clarity on the magnitude of any energy disruptions, but there has been some disruption of shipping in the Strait of Hormuz,\" said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical and U.S. political strategist at BCA Research. \"It is too soon to gauge the impact on the oil market, but the intensity of the military operation implies high odds of a major oil supply disruption\" of 5 million barrels per day or more, he told MarketWatch on Saturday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel strikes on Iran targeted its leadership and military assets, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move followed failed negotiations between the U.S. and Iran to reach a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Iran has responded with strikes across the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Trump calls for regime change after U.S.-Israel attack on Iran. Markets should brace for more than June's brief military campaign. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several news reports Saturday indicated that passage through the Strait of Hormuz has been curtailed. An official from the European Union's naval mission Aspides told Reuters that vessels have been receiving VHF transmission from Iran's Revolutionary Guards saying that no ship is allowed to pass the Strait of Hormuz. So far, there has not been any official closure announcement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'Iran understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports.'Stephen Innes, SPI Asset Management </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran, however, \"understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. \"It would hit not only Western consumers but also China and regional buyers. It is a blunt instrument.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Developments in the region are sure to impact oil prices as soon as trading resumes late Sunday and into early Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices will continue to rise on speculation that the war will expand and that infrastructure will be hit, said BCA Research's Gertken. U.S. global benchmark Brent crude (BRN00) could reach $90 per barrel without significant physical disruption, he said. That would be a more than 20% rise from Friday's settlement of $72.87 for the May contract (BRNK26). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If there is physical disruption, then it can rise above $100 per barrel - \"potentially well above\" that, said Gertken. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Strait of Hormuz: A staggering chokepoint </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Just how much oil could be involved when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz and to the broader region is staggering. Kpler provided a snapshot Saturday of oil and oil-product tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This map is a snapshot of the oil and oil-product tankers currently in and around the Strait Hormuz. Green tankers are loaded, while red ones are in \"ballast,\" or essentially empty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Around 20% of the global petroleum liquids the world uses transits through the strait each day. Last year, just over 14.5 million barrels per day of crude and crude condensate exports passed through the strait, said Matt Smith, U.S. head analyst at Kpler. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From the archives: Strait of Hormuz, the world's biggest oil chokepoint, in focus as U.S.-Iran tensions flare </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saudi Arabia accounted for around 5.5 million daily barrels, Iraq 3.25 million, UAE 1.97 million, Iran 1.59 million, Kuwait 1.55 million, and Qatar 0.72 million, said Smith. Over 90% of that oil typically heads to Asia, around 4% to Europe, 4% to the Americas and the rest to Africa, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Four countries - China, India, Japan and South Korea - account for nearly three-quarters of the crude barrels that pass through the Strait of Hormuz, so they would feel the most significant impact, said Smith. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Middle East is home to half of the world's top 10 oil producers - Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Kuwait, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2022, the region accounted for more than four in 10 barrels of global oil exports, it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet the oil market's biggest risk isn't the Strait of Hormuz being closed, said Kpler's Smith. It's that \"Iran's retaliation leads to broader unrest in the region, putting supply at risk,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran alone produces 3.2 million daily barrels of crude oil, with around 2 million of that primarily exported to China for refining, according to OPIS, a unit of Dow Jones, the publisher of MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Iran's proven crude oil reserves are estimated at 208 billion barrels, according to OPIS. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There have been reports of explosions Iran's Kharg Island, a key export terminal roughly 15 miles off the coast of Iran, OPIS's Denton Cinquegrana and Tracy Cui wrote in a report Saturday. It is still too early to tell what kind of damage, if any, has been done to export infrastructure on Kharg Island, they said, but about 90% of Iran's exports go through it. Sometimes called \"oil island,\" it has a storage capacity of about 7 million barrels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From the archives: Israeli strikes on Iran's 'oil island' could send crude prices soaring </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     OPEC+ meeting Sunday </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Iran conflict comes ahead of Sunday's monthly meeting of eight major oil producers, a group known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, or OPEC+. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The group had been raising their production quotas for most of last year, but paused those increases for the first quarter of 2026 on the heels of expectations for a global oil supply surplus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now OPEC+ is likely to increase production to \"try to suppress prices, cushion the global economy, and undercut Iranian regime funding,\" said BCA Research's Gertken. But if shipping is affected, then any such production increases \"may not be able to reach the global market immediately.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Any chance of a Fed interest-rate cut in 2026 is 'evaporating before our very eyes' with Iran war set to stoke oil prices </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Venessa Wong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans say politicians in Washington aren't taking the cost of living seriously </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers named grocery prices, insurance, prescription drug prices, rent and saving to buy a house as their top affordability challenges, according to an exclusive YouGov-MarketWatch survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As President Donald Trump begins his second year in office, Americans are still struggling with the cost of living. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The president campaigned on assurances that he would solve affordability challenges in 2024, and he touted his record on these issues in Tuesday's State of the Union address. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet, in a YouGov survey conducted this month exclusively for MarketWatch, nearly 47% of survey takers said affordability has worsened somewhat or a lot over the past year. Meanwhile, 36% said it has stayed about the same, and nearly 18% said affordability has improved. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers said grocery prices, insurance, prescription drug prices, rent, and saving to buy a home were the top affordability challenges. Of those who selected insurance, car insurance was the most common concern, followed by health insurance and homeowners' or renters' insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Trump says 'prices are plummeting' during SOTU. Here's what the data say. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Trump administration has lowered taxes and negotiated Medicaid and Medicare drug prices; Trump has proposed a variety of other measures - ranging from a cap on credit-card interest rates to banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yet two-thirds of respondents in the YouGov-MarketWatch poll did not feel elected officials in Washington were taking affordability issues seriously. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hopefully, \"the message is finally breaking through to policymakers that affordability is the challenge of our time,\" said Catherine Harvey, a senior policy program manager in the Research to Action Lab at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research organization. Just as past policy choices have shaped the financial pressures consumers face today, future \"policy choices can relieve some of those same pressures,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Here are Trump's affordability proposals - and where they stand </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Asked who or what is most responsible for Americans' current affordability challenges, 41% of survey takers said the Trump administration was responsible, 40% said corporate greed, 22% said Republican lawmakers, 21% said the Biden administration and 20% said Democratic lawmakers (respondents could pick more than one response for this question). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Trump policies will hamstring the economy's ability to supply goods and services, and these policies aim to increase inequality by transferring income from the bottom and middle toward the top,\" according to a new report by Josh Bivens, chief economist at the  Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. This shift will happen through funding cuts for public services, including Affordable Care Act subsidies, and tax cuts favoring the rich, he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Sometimes this affordability crunch will manifest as higher prices or faster inflation, but it is more likely to appear as slower wage growth and the rollback of public supports for households,\" Bivens wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for what would improve Americans' personal financial situations, respondents primarily said lower prices (38%), higher wages (19%) and lower taxes (12%) would do the most to help them, according to the YouGov-MarketWatch poll of 1,000 people. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People's earnings have gone up since the start of Trump's first term in 2017, but \"not as fast as prices. And that's why people are feeling squeezed,\" Harvey said. In terms of public investments to relieve any of these issues, it will be important to measure what works so the government can \"invest wisely.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More on this: Here are the ideas that could really help solve America's affordability crisis in 2026 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for what would improve Americans' personal financial situations, respondents primarily said lower prices (38%) and higher wages (19%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to MarketWatch ahead of the State of the Union address, \"President Trump pledged to turn the page on Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Trump administration is embarking on an ambitious agenda of reform across every sector of our economy to deliver: from MFN [most favored nation] deals to lower drug prices to an energy abundance push to lower prices at the pump. This overarching agenda has already cooled inflation and cut prices of many household essentials, with more progress in store for the American people.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nicole Huyer, a senior research associate at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in a recent opinion piece that Trump has implemented a variety of policies - \"deregulation, tax cuts, cutting of unnecessary public workers and taxpayer-funded programs, and deportations\" - intended to reduce costs, and called them \"all steps in the right direction.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many Americans, particularly those considered to be low or middle income, face serious challenges in today's economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The gap between high-income and middle- and low-income households has continued to widen since the pandemic, according to the Bank of America Institute. Last month, lower- and middle-income households' year-over-year spending growth ticked down to 0.3% and 1.0%, respectively, while higher-income households' spending growth was more stable at 2.5%, according to Bank of America credit- and debit-card data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The number of Americans who say they don't have money left over after paying their bills rose 7 points to 48% between May and September 2025, according to Ipsos. Seven in 10 people polled by Ipsos said they were spending more on food at home and less on dining out and travel; nearly four in 10 have postponed a vacation or have delayed a big-ticket purchase such as an appliance, car or home renovation; and 30% delayed or skipped medical treatment due to cost. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As noted in an Urban Institute report, for many, \"affordability\" doesn't merely indicate an ability to spend on short-term needs and wants; it means being able to save for mid- and long-term financial goals as well. \"Young people see today's affordability crisis as a barrier to their long-term wealth-building plans, including higher education and homeownership,\" stated the report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For instance, high home prices and interest rates led the share of first-time home buyers to drop to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers reached an all-time high of 40 years old, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Among the roughly one-fourth of preretirees who said last year that they are delaying retirement, 44% cited inflation as a reason. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: Who can actually buy a house today?

In truth, PayPal's optimistic plan for growth through various initiatives to bolster PayPal's Branded Checkout offerings fell short of reality as the 2027 targets were not achievable under the tenure of PayPal's CEO and required both an unrealistically stable consumer landscape and strong execution with clear direction from PayPal and its management.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Why did PayPayl's Stock Drop?<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>On February 3, 2026, PayPal announced a surprise leadership change replacing the company's CEO.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Executives say it's all about learning how to better run their businesses, but some corporate watchers question if this is just a PR move </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elon Musk is just one of a number of chief executives and business leaders who sometimes connects directly with customers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Have a complaint about a company? Or even a compliment to share? The chief executive is expecting your call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At least that's how some businesses are handling customer-service matters these days. Tom Curtis, president of Burger King's U.S. and Canada operations (QSR), recently announced that he's inviting customers to reach out to him and offer feedback. He's even posted a phone number - (305) 874-0520 - for all to give him a ring. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There \"is a broader perception that large brands are not listening closely enough, and taking action based on feedback,\" Curtis said in a statement to MarketWatch. \"I see that as an opportunity. Listening to guests has always been part of how we operate, but this step makes that commitment more personal and visible.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Curtis is in good company these days. You'll find there are a number of prominent executives who often connect with customers. Elon Musk has been known to respond via social media to complaints regarding his Tesla (TSLA) vehicles. Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, has said he walks throughout Virgin planes \"asking for feedback from passengers and crew.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many corporate watchers expect the trend will continue, if not become bigger, as companies look for any way to appear more authentic and genuine - and grow their business as a result. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"CEOs are stepping in because they see an opportunity to break through ... by personally signaling a culture of commitment to customers' wants and needs,\" said G. Tomas M. Hult, a professor at Michigan State University and a business executive at the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Hult has also authored a Harvard Business Review paper looking at how CEOs respond to customers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some question whether these eager-to-connect executives are truly invested in their customers, or if they're just making it appear that way for the sake of publicity. Others wonder if a CEO may do more harm than good by effectively overriding the usual customer-service channels and protocols. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And that's to say nothing of the obvious fact that a CEO simply doesn't have the time to deal with every customer complaint - or even more than a handful of them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It \"is not a scalable business model,\" Hult said. \"The real infrastructure of customer satisfaction depends on front-line customer service, sales and customer experience management personnel who are trained to handle these matters at volume.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'CEOs are stepping in because they see an opportunity to break through.'G. Tomas M. Hult, professor at Michigan State University and business executive at the American Customer Satisfaction Index </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Burger King's Curtis and other executives who spoke with MarketWatch say they're well aware that their efforts constitute just a drop in the proverbial bucket in terms of dealing with customer issues. But they also say these interactions can be critical to their business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Not every [customer] suggestion can or should be implemented, but identifying consistent patterns is incredibly valuable,\" said Curtis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Executives are quick to cite instances when their findings from customer exchanges led to action. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Carina Radonich, co-owner and CEO of the Magic Moment Resort &amp; Kids Club in the Orlando, Fla., area, says it was during her regular conversations with guests that she learned people were frustrated with the limited schedule of the theme-park shuttle service. She also found that guests were disappointed that the resort's breakfast menu didn't vary from day to day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So Radonich made changes, adding more shuttle trips and switching up the morning food offerings, adding things like breakfast burritos and stuffed croissants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Small operational shifts like these drive higher guest satisfaction and repeat bookings,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetwater CEO Mike Clem adds a note to every shipment that goes out to customers. He also makes his email contact information readily available. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not all such interactions with customers are tied to complaints. Mike Clem, the CEO of Sweetwater, a leading retailer of musical instruments, says about 80% of the comments he receives are positive. And Clem receives hundreds of comments a year, because he makes his email contact information readily available. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The responses include Sweetwater customers sending Clem photos of their home studios. \"They send them to me like it's pictures of their kids,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even if a customer has a complaint, Clem says it's all about building a personal connection - and he insists it's those connections that have helped the 47-year-old business reach nearly $2 billion in annual sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There may, however, be another motive for CEOs who offer customers a direct line. Earl Stewart, who owns a Toyota dealership in Lake Park, Fla., has red phones scattered throughout his busy operation - all of which enable customers to put in a call to him personally. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stewart says that when his employees see a customer reaching for one of the phones, they often step in to see if they can resolve the issue themselves. In effect, the phones keep his staff mindful of customers - and that's what Stewart believes has helped his business win accolades and awards. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But Stewart doesn't deny that the phones also help from a brand standpoint, announcing that his dealership is customer-centric all the way up to the top guy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's big PR,\" said Stewart. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Time will tell if the Burger King exec's outreach is seen more as a publicity stunt, or if it's really about listening to customers and learning from them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy partner at Culture Partners, a consulting firm that works with large organizations, says if an executive is truly trying to connect with customers, they don't necessarily have to announce it to the world. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I'm more impressed with the CEOs that don't have press releases,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Alessandra Malito </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never been a generation like the baby boomers - and there probably never will be again </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For many members of the baby-boomer generation, personal finances have improved with time and asset appreciation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Baby boomers seemed to have it easier than other generations: They benefited from the postwar economic boom, had access to affordable higher education and workplace pensions, and found success in real estate and the stock market - and then didn't share the wealth with subsequent generations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New research has found there's some truth to that narrative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Boomers have been more financially comfortable than their predecessors during the same times of life, and if the trends continue, they'll be better off than at least one generation after them, too: Generation X. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For many members of the baby-boomer generation, who were born between 1946 and 1964, their personal finances have improved with time and asset appreciation. Baby boomers, the oldest of whom are turning 80 this year, have watched home prices soar after getting into the housing market at young age. And while they've weathered market volatility and downturns, their investments have climbed through the decades. They're also more educated than their older counterparts, which lends itself to higher wages, experts note. And for them, higher education was cheaper: The average cost of tuition at a public college is up more than 300% since 1963. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A few things worked in boomers' favor,\" said Richard Fry, senior researcher on the social and demographics trends team at Pew Research Center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The steep price of housing is forcing Americans to delay marriage, kids and other milestones </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the time the cohort had reached the ages of 58 to 76 in 2022, the median wealth of baby-boomer households was $432,200, compared with $335,900 for the Silent Generation in 2001, and $185,300 for the Greatest Generation before them in 1983, according to a recent Pew Research Center report that adjusted for inflation as of 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, some baby boomers are significantly better off than their peers; those with bachelor's degrees were wealthier than those with lower levels of education. The top 10% of baby-boomer households held almost three-quarters of the $77 trillion in wealth the generation holds, the research showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, even with more degrees under their belts, the generations younger than the baby boomers are still finding their footing as they plan for retirement. Americans' median retirement savings, when accounting just for people with any retirement savings, was $40,000, according to the National Institute of Retirement Security. When also factoring in American workers without retirement savings, the median amount is $955. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Though boomers' financial well-being blossomed over the decades, their children did not necessarily benefit as a result. Gen X might have it the hardest right now: The so-called slacker generation, born between 1965 and 1980, entered the labor force at a time when defined-benefit pensions began to dissolve and companies placed the responsibility of saving for old age on workers, with the advent of the 401(k). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They've also been caring for both aging loved ones and young or adult children who leave the nest later than the generations before them. Gen X-ers will be retiring around the same time Social Security's trust funds are expected to run out of money, at which point beneficiaries would see a roughly 20% cut to benefits if Congress does not act. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Gen X is living in the perfect storm for their retirement and overall wealth building,\" said Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of Transamerica Institute and its Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Millennials and Gen Z-ers, meanwhile, might have brighter futures. The younger the generation, the more likely they are to start preparing for retirement sooner. The median age when baby boomers started saving for retirement was 35, compared with 30 for Gen X, 25 for millennials and 20 for Gen Z, Collinson said. \"It offers them a greater time horizon for their savings to compound and grow,\" she noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the future is uncertain, Pew's Fry said. Younger generations have attained higher levels of education than their older counterparts, but it's a guess as to how market volatility, home prices, wage growth and other economic aspects of society could evolve over the next few decades. While their overall better education should work in their favor, Fry said, \"it's hard to make predictions about assets and incomes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Alessandra Malito </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Joy Wiltermuth and Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The next 24 to 48 hours of conflict will be crucial for markets after the U.S. and Israel launched military strikes against Iran </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. markets are on edge after the U.S. and Israel's attack on Iran prompted Tehran to respond with strikes in the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel attacked Iran, leading Tehran to quickly retaliate with strikes within Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East after President Donald Trump called on Iranians to take over their government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those developments have raised questions about whether this conflict will last longer - and risk sweeping up more oil-producing nations - than the brief U.S.-Israel military operation in June targeting Tehran's nuclear facilities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This is different,\" said Ali Meli, founder and chief investment officer at Monachil Capital Partners, in a Saturday interview with MarketWatch. \"There's a belief that this may be more aimed at regime change, beyond nuclear deterrence.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     '[T]he question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical.'Ali Meli, Monachil Capital Partners </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now, the question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical,\" said Meli. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens in the next 24 to 48 hours may provide clues to the potential scope of this conflict and its likely impact on markets, with Iran's oil infrastructure and the region's Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, now a major focus. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. There were reports Saturday of Iran threatening to limit passage through the waterway. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes were nearing, as Trump suggested to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The brief June 2025 conflict is a poor guide to what is likely to follow,\" said Nick Redman, analyst at Oxford Analytica, a geopolitical risk-analysis and advisory service owned by MarketWatch publisher Dow Jones. \"Then, Iran sought to avoid confrontation because it understood U.S. objectives were limited, meaning that regional relations and wider international legitimacy were worth preserving.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, however, Iran might look to \"hunker down or seek to draw out any conflict,\" according to Redman. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European leaders from Britain, France and Germany issued a statement Saturday saying their countries had not taken part in the Iran strikes, but they added that they had been in close contact with the U.S., Israel and partners in the region. They called for a resumption of negotiations, the Associated Press reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Clearly, there are more questions than answers in this first day of this,\" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told MarketWatch. \"But there are valid concerns that this could become a larger issue than in June.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Detrick said he's bracing for near-term weakness in equities, a likely spike in crude oil and for gold and other safe-haven assets to rise. \"At the same time, the U.S. economy is still strong, and it's been a strong earnings season,\" he said, adding those factors as being a support for equity prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brent crude (BRN00) prices, the global oil benchmark, could hit $100 a barrel because of the threat of \"a spiraling security situation\" and supply disruptions out of the Middle East, according to Barclays analysts. Prices were near $73 a barrel Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Away from oil jitters, investors endured a violent rotation under the surface of the stock market in February, with investors looking for cover from artificial intelligence disruptions and cracks in credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That could spell a difficult start to March for stocks, plus the \"black cloud overhead\" from the Iran conflict, said Detrick at the Carson Group. \"To think we are going to have a calm start to March probably isn't on anyone's bingo card.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Should a longer, more complicated conflict unfold, the U.S. could tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to keep a lid on oil and gasoline prices. U.S. benchmark crude shot up to over $130 a barrel in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the U.S could look to quickly ramp up domestic production given its shale resources, and it also now exerts control over Venezuela's oil, Meli at Monachil Capital said. That may help keep crude prices in a range, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gold (GC00) jumped nearly 11% in February, finishing at $5,230.50 an ounce on Friday. That marked gold's biggest one-month percentage gain since January 2012, and its monthly gain of $516.60 was the biggest one-month net gain on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse at how investors might react as they wait for Asian markets to open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was under pressure around $65,300. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP and Dow industrials DJIA closed lower Friday, but with the S&amp;P 500 less than 2% off record levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Japanese yen (USDJPY), Swiss franc (USDCHF) and U.S. Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD30Ycould be in the outperformer category. Investors have been increasingly pushing into U.S. government debt recently, a move strategists have attributed to fears over AI threats to employment and economic growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump, addressing Iranians in a video address, said, \"Now is the time to seize control of your destiny.\"  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that congressional notification was provided before the attack, in a social-media post. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump last week offered a deadline of 10 to 15 days for a nuclear deal with Iran, which left this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike. Iran, with which the U.S. under President Barack Obama had negotiated a nuclear pact that Trump canceled during his first White House term, ranks among the world's biggest oil producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Myra P.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A massive backlog of maintenance and software contracts will ensure recurring revenue </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saturday's strikes on Iran by the U.S. and Israel will likely shine an even bigger spotlight on defense stocks. Shown: Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 4001 stealth fighter in file photo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defense stocks have been treated as a geopolitical barometer. When tensions rise and military conflict breaks out, shares climb. When headlines cool, the trade fades. It's a narrative built around procurement cycles and crisis-driven spending. The attack on Iran on Saturday by the U.S. and Israel should repeat this pattern for defense stocks in coming days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But something more structural and long-term has been unfolding, something that looks far less like a one-off weapons sale and more like a long-term service contract. Parts of the defense industry are beginning to resemble subscription businesses, recurring revenue layered on top of a growing installed base. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For investors focused on earnings durability rather than war headlines, that distinction matters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weapons systems have evolved from disposable purchases to multidecade ecosystems nowadays. Once a country fields a fleet of fighter jets, missile-defense batteries or naval destroyers, it commits to years or even decades of operating and support costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. Government Accountability Office has repeatedly noted that operating and support costs can account for roughly 70% of a major weapon system's total life-cycle cost, according to a recent GAO report. Upkeep includes spare parts, depot maintenance, training, software updates, systems integration and availability guarantees. Since national defense cannot tolerate downtime, readiness spending tends to persist even when procurement ebbs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In practical terms, the contractor that builds the platform often remains embedded in its upkeep. Every additional aircraft delivered expands the pool of long-term maintenance, logistics and modernization revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That dynamic increasingly resembles the aerospace aftermarket economy - and in some respects, enterprise software - where installed bases drive recurring cash flow. Three companies that stand to benefit: Lockheed Martin (LMT), RTX (RTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lockheed Martin: the ecosystem model. Lockheed Martin provides the clearest example of this shift. The F-35 program represented 26% of consolidated net sales in 2024, according to the company's latest Form 10-K. The filing explicitly states that F-35 revenue includes development, production and maintenance, underscoring how support and logistics are embedded in the program's economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Service sales increased in 2024, driven in part by higher volume in F-35 upkeep contracts, the company disclosed in that same annual report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By the end of 2025, Lockheed Martin reported a record $194 billion backlog and strong generation of free cash flow in its full-year earnings release. That backlog provides multiyear revenue visibility that many industrial companies lack. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Support performance is not immune from scrutiny; a Pentagon watchdog has recently criticized aspects of F-35 maintenance and aircraft availability. Recurring revenue in defense is contractual and performance-based, not automatic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even so, the installed-base effect is unmistakable: Every aircraft delivered expands a long-term revenue stream tied to readiness and modernization. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     RTX: installed base, diversified. RTX offers a different version of installed-base economy. The company has recently reported strong sales growth and highlighted a backlog approaching $268 billion, according to its latest earnings results. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the defense side, missile systems and air-defense platforms require ongoing upgrades and upkeep. Collins Aerospace operates within a vast installed base of aircraft systems that generate recurring parts and maintenance demand, an approach the company emphasizes in its investor materials. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Commercial-aftermarket revenue behaves in many ways like an annuity tied to flight hours, while defense modernization cycles add a second layer of durability. The combination smooths earnings compared with pure production-driven models. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Northrop Grumman: the long arc of modernization. Northrop Grumman's portfolio is heavily weighted toward advanced systems - stealth aircraft, space assets, sensors and mission technologies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Once fielded, those systems demand continuous upgrades and integration work as modern defense doctrine emphasizes ongoing modernization rather than static platforms. Sensors are refreshed. Software evolves. Networks expand. The company ended 2025 with backlog nearing $95.7 billion, according to its most recent annual report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Northrop's strength in high-end systems integration positions it to benefit from that long modernization arc, although development-heavy programs can introduce project-timing volatility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The software layer: Defense as ongoing service </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The transformation is perhaps the most visible in defense's growing digital footprint. The U.S. Defense Department's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract vehicle reflects a shift toward acquiring commercial cloud services across classification levels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Software-native companies like Palantir Technologies (PLTR) operate directly in that layer, providing analytics and AI systems through mult-year government contracts. Recent analyst coverage has highlighted the company's expanding government engagements and recurring-revenue profile. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Palantir's stock nabs another upgrade, with its valuation now less of a 'struggle' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While valuation and volatility differ from traditional primes, the software layer most closely resembles a true subscription economy within defense budgets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market may be behind the curve </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite these structural shifts, defense contractors are often valued like cyclical industrial companies. The implicit assumption is that earnings are driven primarily by procurement wins and geopolitical events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Developing: The U.S. and Israel attack Iran. Bitcoin and oil offer a glimpse at how markets could react. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If maintenance, modernization and software continue rising as a share of revenue, that assumption will grow increasingly incomplete. Recurring support contracts and installed-base monetization can dampen earnings swings and support steadier free cash flow. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, intellectual property and data rights in maintenance contracts represent a critical issue that the Government Accountability Office examined in its recent review of IP and sustainment planning. Control over technical data can shape who captures margin over the life of a program. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Markets tend to reward predictability. Businesses with durable cash flows often command stronger valuation multiples than those dependent on episodic demand. If defense contractors continue migrating toward service-heavy revenue mixes, the sector's risk profile may increasingly resemble infrastructure rather than crisis trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defense stocks will continue to react to geopolitical headlines, but beneath those swings lies a structural evolution in how revenue is generated and sustained. The companies that control large, technologically complex installed bases - aircraft fleets, missile systems, naval platforms, secure networks - are not merely selling equipment. They are managing ecosystems that require continuous funding to remain operational. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This shift reframes the opportunity. Defense may no longer be just a trade on conflict. Increasingly, it resembles a long-duration cash-flow business anchored in readiness, modernization and software-driven support. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The market may still be pricing yesterday's model. Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Rates have fallen overall since the start of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling mortgage rates are giving home buyers something they haven't seen in a long time: a glimpse of affordability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average 30-year mortgage rate hit 5.98% as of Feb. 26, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.01% the prior week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A year ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.76%. Elevated mortgage rates and high home prices have forced many house hunters to put off buying plans in recent years. That's driven home sales down and pushed the average age of a first-time home buyer to an all-time high of 40. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But falling mortgage rates have now pumped up buyers' purchasing power. A household making the median income of about $86,300 can now \"comfortably afford\" a $331,483 home with a 20% down payment, according to a new analysis from the real-estate platform Zillow (Z). That's $30,000 more than a year ago, Zillow said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The median sales price of an existing home in the U.S. was $396,800 as of January, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A more than $30,000 gain in buying power is meaningful for households that have been stretched thin by high rates. It can mean the difference between settling and choosing,\" noted Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow, in the report. \"That doesn't suddenly make this market affordable for everyone, but it does crack open doors that had firmly shut when rates peaked.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mortgage rates under 3% during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a rush of home buyers. But when rates soared to over 7% in late 2023 and home prices continued to tick upward, many would-be buyers were shut out of the market. That pushed home sales to 31-year low in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some see the chance for increased home sales in the coming months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For the first time in three-and-a-half years, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped into the 5% range, falling even lower than last week's milestone,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's (FMCC) chief economist. \"This rate, combined with the improving availability of homes for sale, is meaningful and will drive more potential buyers into the market for spring home-buying season.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about real estate that you would like to see covered in MarketWatch?
