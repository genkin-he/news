            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Beth Pinsker </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is what family caregivers are up against as the population ages, Pew found </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caregiving can be both draining and fulfilling. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nearly a quarter of Americans who have a parent over the age of 65 are engaged in some kind of caregiving activity for them - and the rest are probably headed in that direction, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center. Caregiving incidence goes up to 31% among those with a parent who is 75 or older. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The data in \"Family Caregiving in an Aging America\" is part of Pew's overall American Trends Panel. Director of research Kim Parker said they didn't go into the study specifically to find the prevalence of caregivers, but once they saw it, they dug deeper to find out what life looks like for these people. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The chief observation: It's a bumpy road. Caregivers are pulled in different directions, since most are also working. They report that caregiving has a more negative than positive impact on a person's emotional well-being, physical health, financial situation, career and social life. At the same time, it has a more positive effect on their relationship with their parents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's so real,\" said Parker. \"It shows the nuance of the experience.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The aging of the baby boom generation is the main force driving this caregiving crisis: About 10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 every day. As Pew notes in other research, there were 76 million births during the baby boom generation, and the oldest among that group are now hitting 80. The U.S. did not reach that number of births again until 1989, with the generation known as millennials, and they are the ones now doing the bulk of the caregiving. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The type of responsibilities also varied in Pew's family caregiver research. About half of caregivers regularly assisted a parent with errands, housework and home repairs. Around 40% helped manage healthcare and another 40% helped with household finances. Only 16% said they regularly helped with more hands-on personal care like bathing and dressing, while 15% said they did this occasionally. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Caregiving doesn't look like the same thing for all families,\" said Jason Resendez, chief executive of the National Alliance for Caregiving, which regularly does research on caregiving. \"You might be really engaged in one type of caregiving at first that evolves into more intense caregiving over time.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Resendez noted that his group's research also shows a dichotomy in the emotional experience of caregiving - it's hard, but at the same time fulfilling. \"One of the realities of caregiving is that it's deeply personal and emotional. It's so hard to provide care,\" he said. \"Our data also shows 50% find a deep sense of purpose with that care. That points to folks finding meaning in this hard work.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That was the case for Amy Goyer, who was a caregiver for both of her parents and a sister and is now a caregiving expert and columnist for AARP. \"The positive and negative are not mutually exclusive,\" she said. \"It can bring you closer, and it can be incredibly draining, full of unpredictability and fear and loss and grief, and can all affect your mental well-being. It's not an either/or. You can have positives and feel joy.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Solutions to the caregiving crisis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's the solution for making things easier? Money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Short of solving for sickness and death, caregivers were strongly in favor of solutions that provided more resources to them. The most popular was tax credits for caregivers, with 78% support. Caregivers were also in favor of resources for respite care, requiring employers to provide paid leave for caregiving and direct payments to caregivers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There was some political divergence in the responses, with Democrats leaning more favorable to these proposals than Republicans. But among both groups, more supported these ideas than were against them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We've seen these findings in other solutions, like support for paid family leave,\" said Parker. \"There is sometimes broad bipartisan support. It takes you beyond party.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Resendez typically sees responses shift more according to income level than political leanings. \"Households with more than $50,000 in income are more favorable to tax credits. Those earning under $50,000 want more direct payment options,\" he said. But either way, he added, \"people want their care to be valued.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caregivers also need each other, Goyer emphasized. Her work revolves around connecting caregivers with each other to provide support. \"It's a puzzle that you put together. It's not one thing that will make the caregiver situation work,\" she said. \"It's about financial help, flexible work, tax breaks, but also connecting with other caregivers. A lot of people feel that support isn't there for them today, and it makes them feel very alone.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Got a question about investing, how it fits into your overall financial plan and what strategies can help you make the most out of your money?

Yet, despite all of the chaotic moves seen in the U.S. equity market over the past few months, the S&amp;P 500 has remained remarkably steady. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The index on Wednesday was trading only marginally above its October peak - at the time, that was its highest level on record. It came despite huge swings beneath the surface. The index is up just 1.4% year-to-date. Over the past 30 trading sessions, the S&amp;P 500 SPX has been stuck in its narrowest trading range since October 2018. Through Feb. 20, the range between the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date high and year-to-date low was just 2.7%, the narrowest since 1966, according to analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the performance between the index's best and worst sectors has been notably varied, and nearly a mirror image of what investors saw in 2025: The worst-performing sector, financial services, is down more than 5%. Information technology, which helped power much of the index's gains over the past three years, is off by 1.6%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, the top-performing sectors - energy, materials and consumer staples - are up 22%, 17.2% and 14.6%, respectively. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Someone described it in our investment policy meeting this morning as like a duck,\" said Aaron Clark, a portfolio manager at GW&amp;K Investment Management. \"It looks like it's just calmly moving along, but beneath the surface, there's a lot going on.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'HALO' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While the S&amp;P 500 hasn't moved much, its equal-weighted sibling has raced ahead. Software stocks have gotten hammered, and megacap names like Amazon and even Nvidia have struggled. But companies involved in old-economy businesses - like retailing, oil and gas extraction and home building - have seen their shares soar. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A new acronym has emerged to describe what is working in the U.S. stock market these days: \"HALO\" - according to Clark, it means \"hard assets, low obsolescence\" risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The thinking is that companies like McDonald's (MCD), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Caterpillar (CAT) are less likely to see their business models disrupted by the increasing adoption of technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Stocks are swinging like crazy while the S&amp;P 500 goes nowhere in 2026. Investors might not like what comes next. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Outside of the U.S., stocks have been chugging along, with indexes in South Korea, Europe and elsewhere hitting record highs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trading places </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     J.C. Parets, a market technician and founder of TrendLabs, said the level of dispersion between winners and losers in the U.S. equity market has been looking pretty extreme lately. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's not good or bad, bearish or bullish. It's just different,\" Parets said. That being said, for the bull market to continue, the S&amp;P 500 needs at least some participation from Big Tech names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While the \"Magnificent Seven\" and software names have struggled, investors appear to be moving their money into other corners of the U.S. equity market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since the start of the year, members of the Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks have shed a combined $827 billion in market value, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the same period, stocks in the energy, materials and consumer-staples sectors have tacked on another $979 billion, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The tech sector still dwarfs these other three. Tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have a combined market capitalization of more than $19 trillion as of Wednesday's close. Energy, materials and consumer-staples stocks combined are worth less than $6.5 trillion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A punishing selloff in software names has weighed on the broader tech sector, even as semiconductor stocks have continued to perform quite well. But as shares of Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST) and other members of the consumer staples sector have zoomed higher, the forward price-to-earnings multiple for the sector - a popular valuation metric used by investment analysts - has surpassed that of tech. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Toomey, managing director of equities trading at Jefferies, said that over the past four months, the tech sector's price-to-earnings multiple has collapsed at the fastest pace since at least 2006, on a rolling four-month basis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Toomey said tech stocks might be nearing the end of this rout. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I think we could look back at this week as an inflection point for Tech,\" Toomey said in commentary shared with MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stocks were mixed early Thursday, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average teetering on the cusp of a weekly loss. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael DeStefano and Chelsea Ng contributed </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Joseph Adinolfi </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But so far in 2026, factor strategies that weight the stocks in other ways have performed much better. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So far in 2026, a number of index funds that follow alternative strategies to track subsets of the S&amp;P 500 or change the index's weighting have performed quite well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 SPX is weighted by market capitalization. This means success is rewarded, with large companies that have grown rapidly or been excellent financial performers dominating the index's weighting. According to analysts at Ned Davis Research, the index is now 39.1% concentrated to its largest 10 companies by market cap - down from 41.3% in October, which marked the highest concentration level since at least 1972. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Among the largest 10 components of the S&amp;P 500, all except Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) (the largest two components of the index) were down for 2026 through Wednesday, with Microsoft (MSFT) (the third-largest component) down 17%. But the index itself was still up 1.5%, showing increasing interest in companies beyond Big Tech. Those figures exclude dividends. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although the index has held up nicely, investors have been flocking to index funds that follow alternative strategies, such as an equal-weighed approach to the S&amp;P 500 XX:SP500EW. Last week Isabel Wang spoke with money managers and traders who described this dramatic shift in the stock market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Money is flowing into alternative S&amp;P 500 strategies </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nick Kalivas, Invesco's head of factor strategy for exchange-traded funds, told MarketWatch of significant \"net new flow\" into several ETFs that are designed to offer investors greater diversification within the S&amp;P 500. For the cap-weighted index, he said that the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA) - as a group had lowered the S&amp;P 500's return so far in 2026 by about 2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Funds seeing a high level of interest have included the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP, which had taken in $8.9 billion in net new flow during 2026 through Friday, Kalivas said. RSP now has about $90 billion in assets under management. It has returned 6.3% this year, compared with a return of 1.6% return for the for State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&amp;P 500 with a traditional market-cap weighting. These and subsequent investment returns in this article include reinvested dividends and are net of fund expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You have seen some broadening\" of performance within the S&amp;P 500 this year, Kalivas said. \"Certainly, equal-weight technology has done better than cap-weighted.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He added: \"When you dive a bit deeper, you have had a rally in smaller semiconductor-related names.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Net new flow\" is a term specific to ETFs. It refers to inflows that cause market makers to create new shares of exchange-traded funds. To understand that, we need to explain how ETFs are priced. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A traditional open-ended mutual fund's share price is calculated once a day at the market close. This means adding up the market value of all the fund's investments, plus its cash, as of the market close. That net asset value is then divided by the number of shares in the fund in order to arrive at the net asset value per share, which we will call the NAV. Investors can only buy or sell an open-ended mutual fund's shares at the market close. The fund will issue or redeem shares every day based on investors' buy and sell orders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An exchange-traded fund will calculate its NAV every day the same way. But since it is publicly traded on an exchange, the ETF will also have a share price that may match the NAV or trade a bit higher or lower than the NAV. A market maker at the exchange where the ETF is listed will decide whether the ETF should issue new shares or redeem shares in order to keep the share price close to the NAV. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Kalivas said that other Invesco factor strategies that narrow down the S&amp;P 500 and have received significant inflows so far in 2026 include the firm's S&amp;P 500 Revenue ETF RWL, S&amp;P 500 Quality ETF SPHQ and S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF SPLV. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Comparing nine S&amp;P 500 factor strategies during 2026 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Back in November, we looked at nine Invesco factor strategies tracking subsets of or alternate weightings to the S&amp;P 500 and found that the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Momentum ETF SPMO stood out by beating the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 and all the other factor strategies by wide margins for one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In light of this year's sea change for the stock market, it is time for an update. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We are looking at the same set of 11 ETFs, starting with SPY and one of several large alternatives that take the cap-weighted approach, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF VOO.

This ETF holds 100 stocks. The portfolio is reset twice a year when stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are ranked by how much their prices have risen over the previous 12 months, then scored to take volatility into account. The portfolio is made up of the 20% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that score highest, then weighted by a combination of the momentum score and market cap. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF SPHD has been the best performer on the list so far this year. The fund holds 50 stocks, weighted by dividend yield. The portfolio is reconstituted twice a year, first trimming the S&amp;P 500 to the 75 stocks with the highest trailing dividend yields, and then cutting that down to the 50 showing the least daily price volatility over the past 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Invesco Pure Value ETF RPV has returned 7.6% this year, while the Pure Growth ETF RPG has returned 7.5%. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices maintains overlapping S&amp;P 500 Value and Growth indexes. The index provider's value scores are based on ratios of companies' book value, earnings and revenue to price. Growth scores incorporate three years of profit and sales growth, as well as 12-month price momentum. About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies will have high enough value and growth scores to straddle the Value and Growth indexes. That third of the index is excluded from the Pure Value and Pure Growth indexes tracked by these two ETFs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Quality ETF has returned 7.5% this year. It combines returns on equity, debt-to-book value and an \"accruals ratio\" of operating assets to total assets. The index tracked by this fund is rebalanced twice a year and weighted by the product of each stock's quality score and market capitalization. Kalivas pointed out that this fund's methodology means that it only holds Apple among the Magnificent Seven, \"with no hyperscaler exposure.\" Hyperscalers are companies that have been spending the most heavily on building infrastructure to support the development of generative artificial intelligence technology. Going further, Kalivas said that \"when you increase your asset base\" by spending heavily on plant and equipment, \"it lowers your profitability,\" which is reflected in the makeup of the SPHQ portfolio. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF has returned 7.1% so far in 2026.

This shift over the past 25 years, aided by technological advances, is helping to meet the growing demand for transplants, the authors say.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2918263/organ_donor_data.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2918263/organ_donor_data.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">More than 100,000 Americans are currently waiting for a lifesaving transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. To address the shortage, experts have long searched for ways to safely and ethically increase the number of usable organs recovered from people who die.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new analysis traced how the deceased-donor pool has evolved because of these efforts. According to the results, circulatory-death donors climbed from 2% of all donors in 2000 to 49% of donors in 2025. Their organs are now a major source of kidneys and livers, and are increasingly used for lung, heart, and pancreas transplants. </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Our findings reveal that a rise in donations after circulatory death makes organ transplantation possible for thousands of patients who might otherwise die on the waitlist,\" said study lead author Syed Ali Husain, MD, MPH.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Most donated organs historically came from people who were declared brain dead, notes Husain, an assistant professor in the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Because the heart continues to beat after brain death, their tissues continue to receive oxygen-rich blood.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">By contrast, donation after circulatory death involves donors who do not meet criteria for brain death and who cannot be kept alive without life support machines. In these cases, if the family chooses to stop life support, it is then given the option to do so in an operating room instead of the intensive care unit. If the patient dies within a set time after support is removed, organs can be recovered and used for transplantation, preserving the opportunity to donate according to the wishes of the family and the patient.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Since the organs may briefly go without oxygen and nutrients as the body shuts down and the heart stops, they were previously considered to not function as well after transplantation compared to those recovered from brain-dead donors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">During the past decade, however, new tools have helped overcome this challenge and may explain the increased use of circulatory-death donation. For example, normothermic regional perfusion temporarily restores blood flow to organs that will be donated after the heart stops, and machine perfusion devices pump nutrient- and oxygen-rich fluid through organs after removal from the body. Both approaches limit damage and make more organs suitable for transplantation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">These advances may also enable surgeons to use organs from people who would once have been excluded, the authors say. The study showed for the first time that today's circulatory-death donors tend to be older, have a higher body mass index (a measure of obesity), and are more likely to have health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure than similar donors in earlier years.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A report on the findings will be published online Feb. 26 in the <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Journal of the American Medical Association.</em></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For the investigation, the researchers analyzed data from the Organ Procurement &amp; Transplantation Network, which tracks every organ recovered in the U.S. They calculated the yearly share of circulatory-death donors and the resulting kidney, liver, lung, heart, and pancreas transplants. The team also assessed recovery patterns across the 55 organ procurement organizations in the U.S. — regional nonprofit agencies that coordinate donation in their assigned areas.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The researchers found that in some parts of the country, donation after circulatory death was far more common than in others, with shares ranging from as high as 73% of donors to as low as 11% of donors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Our results highlight the opportunity to further grow donation after circulatory death and save even more lives,\" said study co-senior author Dorry Segev, MD, PhD. Segev is a professor and vice chair in the Department of Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the director of the school's Center for Surgical &amp; Transplant Applied Research (CSTAR).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Clear, consistent standards for donation after circulatory death are important so patients are protected and the public is assured that the process is safe,\" said study co-senior author Babak Orandi, MD, PhD, an associate professor in the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.    </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"As donation after circulatory death becomes more common, expanded education and dialogue with patients, families, and clinicians will be essential to maintaining that trust,\" added study co-author Macey Levan, JD, PhD, an associate professor in the Departments of Surgery and Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">According to Levan, the researchers next plan to explore ways to improve donor identification and recovery practices, as well as examine how well organs from circulatory-death donors perform over time compared with those from brain-dead donors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">National Institutes of Health grant K23DK133729 provided funding for the study.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Along with Husain, Segev, Orandi, and Levan, NYU Langone researchers involved in the study are Jennifer Motter, MHS; Darren Stewart, MS; Sunjae Bae, MD, PhD; Brendan Parent, JD; Bonnie Lonze, MD, PhD; Philip Sommer, MD; Sommer Gentry, PhD; Jeffrey Stern, MD; and Allan Massie, PhD.  </p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Husain has received consulting fees from the pharmaceutical company Novartis, Orandi has served on an advisory board for the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, and Stewart has received consulting fees from Hansa Biopharma.

            "title": "Royal Bank 1Q Earnings Lifted by Personal Banking, Markets Growth — Update",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank of Canada's earnings rose in the first quarter as the lender saw growth in its retail banking business and capital markets operations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The bank, the country's biggest by market value and one of the largest in North America by assets, joined its peers in Canada in turning in a stronger-than-expected profit with gains across most business segments. This came despite elevated loan-loss provisions and continued economic uncertainty with trade tensions still high globally. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank's net income rose to 5.79 billion Canadian dollars (US$4.23 billion), or C$4.03 a share, for the three months to Jan. 31, from C$5.13 billion, or C$3.54, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to C$4.08 in the first quarter, topping the C$3.85 expected by analysts polled by FactSet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Total revenue rose 7.3% to C$17.96 billion, while analysts were expecting C$17.5 billion. The result was buoyed by record capital markets revenue for the quarter, asset growth in its wealth management arm, and revenue growth of 9% for personal banking and roughly 4% for commercial banking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Toronto-based lender's return on equity, a measure of profitability closely watched by analysts, expanded by 0.8 percentage point on last year to 17.6%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Household spending in Canada has remained relatively resilient despite an elevated unemployment rate and the hit to parts of the economy from the Trump administration's approach to trade policy and use of tariffs. Still, the housing market has softened in recent months and economists have warned of possible stresses on households as homeowners renew mortgages at higher interest rates. Business spending also has been relatively subdued, particularly in industries exposed to the shift toward protectionist trade policies by the U.S., even as equity markets in both Canada and the U.S. notched record highs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank in a letter to shareholders said it expects economic growth to remain positive across most advanced economies despite trade uncertainties. Canada's economy has shown signs of improvement in recent months and the jobless rate has edged lower, and the bank forecasts modest growth in the first half of the year after what was likely a flat final quarter of 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The bank, like many of its peers, projects the Bank of Canada will leave its policy interest rate steady through 2026 and it isn't anticipating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian goods to rise further, though the existing trade pact between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico is up for renegotiation this year. That backdrop, executives said, is expected to mean mortgage growth in Canada is modest this year given affordability challenges, economic uncertainty, and a pullback Canadian immigration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank's allowance for credit losses on performing loans was steady on the prior quarter, but the allowance on performing loans was increased. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Its provision for credit losses increased C$40 million year-over-year to C$1.09 billion, and was C$83 million higher than a quarter earlier. The result was above the C$1.06 billion analysts were looking for the bank to set aside against the risk of loan losses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Stephen Boland, an analyst at Raymond James in Toronto, said it was a solid quarter for Royal Bank that was again supported by markets-facing operations. He said there was a notable rise in gross impaired loans for the three months after trending lower in recent quarters, but said it wasn't overly concerning. Gross impaired loans as a percentage of loans and acceptances widened to 0.86% in the latest quarter, from 0.8% a quarter earlier and 0.78% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The bank's shares fell in early trading, underperforming the broader market in Canada, declining 1.9% to narrow the gain over the last three months to just over 8%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Like each of Canada's other big banks, Royal Bank sits on a strong capital position that has allowed it to continue buying back shares and a quarter earlier supported a lift in its dividend. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Royal Bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 13.7% at the end of January, up 0.5 percentage point from the same quarter last year. That remains well above the at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets that Canada's banking regulator requires from the big lenders. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">BrainCheck Raises $13 Million to Expand AI-Enabled Cognitive Care Platform</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck, a digital platform for cognitive assessment and care, today announced that it has raised an additional $13 million in Series A financing. The round was led by Next Coast Ventures, with participation from S3 Ventures and UPMC Enterprises.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe funding will support the expansion of BrainCheck’s enterprise cognitive care infrastructure, including deeper workflow integration, longitudinal patient monitoring, population-scale deployment across primary care and specialty settings, and advanced AI-assisted clinical infrastructure designed for risk-bearing and value-based environments.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIn addition to technology expansion, BrainCheck is now partnering with collaborative care organizations to operationalize cognitive care delivery within practices that lack the staffing or infrastructure to execute comprehensive care workflows. These partnerships extend BrainCheck beyond assessment into structured, scalable cognitive care pathways—supporting providers with both digital tools and operational care enablement models.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs populations age and accountability for cognitive outcomes shifts toward value-based and risk-bearing models, standardized cognitive assessment is increasingly serving as the entry point to new care pathways. BrainCheck’s platform is designed to help practices identify cognitive impairment earlier and activate structured follow-up care in a sustainable, scalable manner.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Cognitive health is becoming a greater priority across the healthcare system, and the infrastructure supporting it must evolve as well,” said Mike Smerklo, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Next Coast Ventures. “BrainCheck is contributing to that evolution by bringing greater consistency, objectivity, and longitudinal insight into cognitive care. We’re excited to support the company’s next phase of growth.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“UPMC clinicians have been evaluating BrainCheck for several years and have seen firsthand how standardized digital cognitive assessment can support them in real-world practice,” said Adele Towers, M.D., M.P.H., UPMC geriatrician and senior clinical advisor to UPMC Enterprises, the innovation, commercialization, and venture capital arm of UPMC. “We look forward to our continued engagement with BrainCheck and bringing it to more clinicians supporting patients who could benefit from earlier detection, long-term monitoring, and scalable cognitive care within and beyond our health system.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck is used by more than 500 healthcare organizations nationwide, with clinicians having completed over 640,000 cognitive assessments using BrainCheck Assess™, the company’s FDA Class II digital cognitive assessment (DCA). The BrainCheck platform offers 29 validated cognitive screeners and care planning tools designed to enable standardized, repeatable measurement and longitudinal tracking, fully integrated into clinical workflows.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nTesting protocols are customizable within the BrainCheck platform and available in English and Spanish. Providers across primary care, neurology, and psychiatry use the platform to assess and monitor cognitive function and behavioral changes across a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions, with a primary focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck’s strategy centers on building structured cognitive care pathways that support:\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n• Earlier identification of cognitive risk\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• Objective, repeatable assessment over time\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• AI-assisted population health and longitudinal analysis\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• Seamless integration into health system environments and EHR systems\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>• Coordination across clinical teams and care settings\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe platform is designed to reduce operational friction within time-constrained clinical environments while ensuring that interpretation and care decisions remain fully clinician-directed.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“This capital allows us to continue building tools and workflows that fit how clinicians actually practice,” said Chris Loughlin, Chief Executive Officer of BrainCheck. “We are focused on reducing friction in cognitive assessment, supporting longitudinal care, and using AI responsibly to assist, never replace, clinical decision-making.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs the population ages, the gap between cognitive impairment and formal diagnosis continues to widen. Primary care clinicians lack the time, staffing, and infrastructure to manage cognitive health longitudinally, even as demand accelerates.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAt the same time, blood-based biomarkers and emerging therapies are transforming the care pathway. Objective digital cognitive assessment is increasingly becoming the starting point of this new continuum—guiding risk stratification, informing laboratory and specialty referral, and enabling structured follow-up.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck provides a standardized digital infrastructure designed to support this transformation at a population scale across large health systems and accountable care organizations. By embedding repeatable cognitive measurement directly into clinical workflows, the platform helps practices and ACOs close the diagnosis gap, activate appropriate care pathways, and scale modern cognitive care across large patient populations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Physicians have limited time to address cognitive care,” said Stephen Bekanich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of BrainCheck. “Accountable Care Organizations and value-based care models are increasingly responsible for identifying cognitive impairment earlier and managing it longitudinally across large patient populations. We are seeing the emergence of collaborative care structures designed to support that accountability. BrainCheck provides the standardized, scalable infrastructure that enables these models to operate effectively.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more information, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.braincheck.com%2F&amp;esheet=54434446&amp;newsitemid=20260226481557&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.braincheck.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=0fa0a821028d5b164dfcc03c53d67fbf\" tabindex=\"0\">www.braincheck.com</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About BrainCheck</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nBrainCheck is a clinically validated digital platform for cognitive assessment and care, anchored by BrainCheck Assess™—its flagship FDA Class II digital cognitive assessment.
