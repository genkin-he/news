McMillan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     S&amp;P 500 is stuck in a trading range and the market is eager for a breakout - up or down </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The option market is expecting some potentially volatile moves after next week's earnings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Next week is another big one for earnings. Perhaps the most-watched of these among tech stocks is Broadcom (AVGO). Others include Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the economically sensitive retail sector, earnings to note include Gap Stores (GAP), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) and Target (TGT) - all of which have had a history of moving up after earnings reports. While they don't move every time, it's frequent enough to be of interest. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The table below shows some of the major stocks with increased implied volatility. That is, the option market is expecting a potentially volatile move after the earnings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Our approach is to attempt to buy the shortest-term straddle possible (generally the one expiring on the Friday after the earnings reporting date) and to exit at the close of the first full day of trading after the earnings have been reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Specifically, the columns in the table (from left to right) are: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Date: The earnings reporting date, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Pm?: Whether the earnings are to be reported before the market opens (\"N\") or after the market closes (\"Y\") </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Symbol: The stock symbol </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Needed: The most that we would pay for the near-term straddle, with the price of the straddle expressed as a percentage of the underlying stock price. In reality, this is the percentage move that is smaller than six of the past 10 post-earnings moves in this stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Optvol: The 20-day average of total option volume on this stock.

In the table, it shows the \"count\" as 8.64%. That means if we can buy the March 6 at-the-money straddle for 8.64% of the stock price or less, we should. The at-the-money AVGO (Mar. 6) 310 straddle traded on Wednesday for about 11% of AVGO's stock price, so this straddle would not be a buy, though straddles often become a bit cheaper as the actual earnings date approaches. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Silver rings a bell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a new weighted put-call ratio buy signal in the iShares Silver Trust  SLV. The last buy signal in November turned out to be an excellent one, so we are going to get back on board again now. The precious-metals story has been well-documented in the financial (and other) media, especially since the metals pretty much \"crashed\" at the end of January. We were able to weather that storm by continually rolling the options higher as SLV rallied strongly last December and January. That will be our approach again this time, if SLV begins to escalate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is one big difference in silver options now versus in November: price. Silver options are expensive. The way to partially counter expensive options is with a bull spread, so that is what we are going to use for this recommendation: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buy 2 SLV (Mar. 20) at-the-money calls and Sell 2 SLV (Mar. 20) calls with a striking price 15 points higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That should result in a price of about 5.0 points per spread. We will hold these spreads as long as the put-call ratio is on a buy signal for SLV. Roll both sides up if SLV trades at the higher strike in the spread. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     New recommendation: ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     ARK Innovation ARKK and ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood are widely followed. It had a massive setback in the bear market of 2022 and still hasn't fully recovered. Now a put-call ratio buy signal has emerged. The last two buy signals - marked on the chart below - were successful, although the one a year ago was far more of a success than the one this past December. In any case, pessimism abounds, and put buyers have been active. Our put-call ratios are contrary indicators, so when there is too much pessimism, it is time to buy the stock or buy call. That is the case now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buy 2 ARKK (Apr. 17) at-the-money calls in line with the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We will hold the calls as long as the weighted put-call ratio for ARKK remains on a buy signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stock market insight: Stuck in the middle </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 Index SPX continues to trade in a range between essentially 6,720 and 7,000. In the past couple of weeks, it's even been in a slightly tighter range between about 6,800 and 6,950. Traders are approaching this in one of two ways: Swing traders attempt to sell the top end of the range and buy the lower end. That works until there is a strong breakout from the range. Conversely, momentum traders are waiting for that breakout, hoping to get on board for a strong ride upward on a close above 7,000 or a sharp slide downward on a close below 6,720. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equity-only put-call ratios continue to rise, as a large amount of hedging (buying puts for protection) seems to be taking place while SPX trades sideways in a range. As long as these put-call ratios are rising, that is negative for stocks. Although, there is an old saying \"An overhedged market always rises.\" That might eventually turn out to be the case here. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market breadth has been mixed. In fact, our two oscillators are split, with the NYSE-based oscillator being on a sell signal, while the \"stocks only\" oscillator is on a buy. Cumulative breadth has made new all-time highs this week, though, and that is a positive thing for the market in general. Also, cumulative volume breadth, using NYSE data, made a new all-time high. Generally, when these cumulative breadth indicators are making new highs, SPX will follow along and do the same, eventually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the NYSE, new highs continue to dominate new lows. This has been going on since just after Thanksgiving, and this indicator remains one of our most bullish. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The volatility indicators have continued to show a bit of worry, though. First, of all, VIX VIX has been rising since December. Maybe that's just more of the hedging activity, but it has now produced a trend of a VIX sell signal for the stock market. This is partially countered by the \"spike peak\" buy signal of Feb. 5. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The construct of volatility derivatives got a little \"worried\" last week but has returned to a fully bullish outlook for stocks. The terms structures are sloping upwards, and the VIX futures are trading at a premium to VIX. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So, little about the market has really changed this week. SPX remains in a trading range, and the indicators are mixed as a result. We continue to await the breakout from this range, for a momentum trade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Follow-up action: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We are using a standard rolling procedure for our SPY SPY spreads: In any vertical bull or bear spread, if the underlying hits the short strike, then roll the entire spread. That would be roll up in the case of a call bull spread or roll down in the case of a bear put spread. Stay in the same expiration and keep the distance between the strikes the same unless otherwise instructed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, for outright long options, roll if they become 8 points in-the-money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 TSEM (Mar. 20) 140 call and short 1 TSEM (Mar. 20) 155 call: Roll up both sides, 15 points each, if TSEM (TSEM) trades at $155. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 BMO (June 18) 130 call and long 1 BMO (June 18) 130 put: Continue to hold this straddle. Roll the calls up if BMO (BMO) trades at $150 and roll the puts down if it trades at $110. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 6 AAL (Mar. 20) 14 puts: We will continue to hold as long as the AAL (AAL) put-call ratio is on this sell signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 LH (Mar. 20) 280 call: We will hold the call as long as the put-call ratio for LH (LH) remains on a buy signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 3 ERAS (Mar. 20) 12.5 calls: Raise the ERAS (ERAS) closing stop to 11.80. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 expiring SPY (Feb. 27) 688 call and short 1 SPY (Feb. 27) 708 call: This is the position that was based on the \"spike peak\" buy signal of Jan. 21. Exit this position now, since it has been held for more than 22 trading days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 SPY (Mar. 20) 692 put and short 1 SPY (Mar. 20) 652 put: This is the position based on the recent breadth oscillator sell signal. Market breadth has improved, so this position should be closed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 0 CSCO (Mar. 20) 82.5 calls: These CSCO (CSCO) calls were stopped out on Feb. 23. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 SPY (Mar. 20) 688 call and short 1 SPY (Mar. 20) 708 call: the trading system that we have built around these spike peaks calls for holding the position for 22 trading days (about a month), but it would be stopped out if VIX were to close above 23.10 - its most recent peak. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Long 1 BKR (July 17) 65 call and long 1 BKR (July 17) 60 put: Roll the BKR (BKR) call up at 75, and roll the put down at 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Send questions to: lmcmillan@optionstrategist.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lawrence G.

According to a <span class=\"mdc-article-underline\" data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628861-1&amp;h=3395379122&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellonation.com%2Fmag%2FPA%2FFort_Washington%2F45428%3Fpage_id%3D414130&amp;a=HelloNation+article\" tabindex=\"0\">HelloNation article</a></span> featuring Criminal Defense Attorney Finn Skovdal of Skovdal Law, the process can feel stressful, but understanding each stage brings clarity. Pennsylvania uses a tiered structure for DUI cases, which means that outcomes depend on factors like blood alcohol content, whether any accident occurred, and the person's prior record. While a first time DUI is always serious, many first time offenders discover that the system offers programs designed to support safer outcomes and long term stability.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"></p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Skovdal explains that one of the first concerns people have is whether they will face a license suspension. Pennsylvania's DUI law links penalties to the level of impairment. For a first time DUI, some individuals avoid license suspension completely, while others may face one if their blood alcohol content falls into a higher tier. Even when a suspension applies, Pennsylvania sometimes allows restricted driving privileges for work or medical needs. Skovdal emphasizes that first time offenders benefit from learning which tier applies to them as early as possible so they can prepare for the next steps.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Another major worry involves the possibility of jail time. While Pennsylvania law allows for jail in first time DUI cases, Skovdal notes that Montgomery County offers structured alternatives. One of the most important alternatives is ARD, which stands for Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition. ARD is designed for individuals with clean criminal histories and focuses on rehabilitation rather than punishment. Although not automatic, it provides a clear path toward reduced penalties. For many first time offenders who qualify, ARD eliminates the risk of jail time and creates a smoother resolution.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">ARD also offers a benefit that many first time DUI defendants value greatly: the chance for expungement. After completing all program requirements, individuals may request that the DUI be cleared from their record in many situations. Skovdal explains that expungement is not immediate and requires full compliance, which might include classes, evaluations, community service, or safe driving programs. Because each county handles ARD admissions differently, early action becomes important. The sooner a person applies and provides documentation, the better the chances of achieving a result that protects the person's future and keeps opportunities open.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Timing plays a major role throughout the entire first time DUI process. Once a charge is filed, deadlines begin immediately. Notices are mailed, hearings are scheduled, and choices must be made about whether to pursue ARD or follow another legal strategy. Skovdal explains that early review of evidence, the officer's report, and the testing procedures used under Pennsylvania law helps shape the direction of the case. Understanding these details early prevents missed opportunities and keeps the case on track.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The first major event for most first time DUI cases is the preliminary hearing. This hearing offers the court an initial review of the case and decides whether it moves forward. While most cases continue, this stage also serves as the starting point for defense strategy. Many first time offenders use the time before the preliminary hearing to complete background checks, evaluations, or other steps needed for ARD consideration. In Montgomery County, defendants often must waive their preliminary hearing to be considered for ARD. Skovdal explains that being prepared for this expectation prevents delays and keeps the case aligned with the county's established process.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As the case proceeds, first time offenders may attend additional hearings related to ARD eligibility or case management. Montgomery County has an organized administrative system for handling DUI cases, and learning how it operates helps individuals remain calm. Staying organized, appearing for all scheduled hearings, and submitting documents on time reduces complications. Skovdal notes that these steps also help people understand the timeline and what responsibilities they must meet at each stage of the process.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The overall experience of navigating a first time DUI in Montgomery County depends greatly on early preparation and informed decision making. Skovdal emphasizes that people who act quickly often reduce penalties, protect their driving privileges, and remain eligible for expungement later. While a first time DUI is serious, it does not have to define the person's future. Programs like ARD, along with careful attention to deadlines and guidance from legal counsel, help individuals move through the process with greater confidence. Understanding the system, responding promptly, and preparing for key moments such as the preliminary hearing help create a more manageable experience with stronger long term results.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The article, <span class=\"mdc-article-underline\" data-v-1f1bdc8a=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628861-1&amp;h=1864922766&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellonation.com%2Fmag%2FPA%2FFort_Washington%2F45428%3Fpage_id%3D414130&amp;a=What+to+Expect+for+a+First-Time+DUI+in+Montgomery+County\" tabindex=\"0\">What to Expect for a First-Time DUI in Montgomery County</a></span>, features insights from Criminal Defense Attorney Finn Skovdal in HelloNation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About HelloNation<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>HelloNation is a premier media platform that connects readers with trusted professionals and businesses across various industries.

More broadly, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX fell 0.5% to snap back-to-back gains, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped a sharp 1.2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia is \"a big heavyweight\" in the S&amp;P 500 at around 8% of the index, so when it drops, it hurts the U.S. equities benchmark, according to Katie Stockton, a chartered market technician and founder of research firm Fairlead Strategies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia's earnings results also didn't assuage the stock market's broader concerns about Big Tech's tremendous spending on artificial intelligence, with investors anxious about how much megacap companies are raising their capital-expenditure budgets on AI and the uncertainty about the return on that investment further down the road, according to Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech held back gains for the S&amp;P 500, making it difficult for the index to advance Thursday, even as other parts of the market broadly climbed, Gordon said in a phone interview. \"This is just how the index math haunts you.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can look across the board on solid results, but I think it's become the new normal in terms of this pushback on a lot of the spending on AI,\" said Gordon. Investors remain worried about whether Big Tech valuations are inflated relative to \"what they're actually worth,\" he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Nvidia is the biggest weight in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index NDX QQQ, with its massive market value having the heft to move the market and influence sentiment, Stockton at Fairlead Strategies said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors had run up Nvidia's stock in the lead-up to its highly anticipated earnings report released after the stock market's closing bell Wednesday, said Stockton. \"From a sentiment perspective,\" expectations on the part of investors were \"clearly quite high.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Market sentiment surrounding AI and Big Tech soured Thursday, with shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) also seeing a sharp selloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Blips\" higher in the S&amp;P 500's tech sector XX:SP500.45 \"aren't being maintained,\" cautioned Stockton. \"If we lose market breadth\" and Big Tech stocks aren't there \"to pick up the slack,\" that would be \"problematic\" for the S&amp;P 500, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Nvidia \"delivered another stellar set of results that make the extraordinary seem ordinary,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note Wednesday. But \"given the material upward revisions in hyperscale capex expectations over the last five weeks, investor expectations were likely elevated coming into the print.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Big Tech selloff </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS - an exchange-traded fund that holds Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet, Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) - fell 1.6% on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Nvidia dropped 5.5%, snapping a four-day winning streak and leaving the company with a market value of $4.49 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That company was the worst performer in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, with Meta and Microsoft the only two stocks held by the fund that ended the day's trading in positive territory, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors on Thursday also were weighing earnings reports from software companies Salesforce (CRM) and Snowflake (SNOW), which both closed sharply higher Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The software sector broadly outperformed semiconductor stocks, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV gaining 2.2%, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX dropped 3%, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But an upbeat day for software stocks and other areas of the S&amp;P 500 weren't enough to offset the damage from Big Tech. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three sectors in which Big Tech resides, including information technology, communication services XX:SP500.50 and communication discretionary XX:SP500.25, make up 55% of the S&amp;P 500, said Gordon. That left the S&amp;P 500 down Thursday, even as the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP - which equally weighs stocks in the index - finished the day with a 0.6% gain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Christine Idzelis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
