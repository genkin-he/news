This travel-themed reality show continues iQIYI's legacy of delivering standout seasonal IPs while highlighting authentic and compelling female narratives.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2810051/The_Blooming_Journey_2.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2810051/The_Blooming_Journey_2.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Building on the popularity of season 1, season 2 features five of China's renowned female celebrities alongside two young companions. The format breaks away from task-driven reality competition: each episode is anchored in a meaningful theme, with cast members exploring new challenges that highlight collaboration, self-discovery, and the power of personal stories. This season's journey covers diverse destinations – Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Chongqing, Quanzhou, Hong Kong, and Macao – giving viewers a panoramic look at the broader Chinese culture.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Performance data demonstrates robust anticipation and engagement: Season 2 generated over a thousand trending topics on social media prior to premiere, reflecting the powerful draw of iQIYI's original programming. Season 1 achieved notable success, with iQIYI's content popularity index surpassing 8,000 and leading third-party rankings such as Enlightent, Dengta, Maoyan, Endata, Guduo, and Vlinkage. The show has not only captured young audiences, but also reached lower-tier markets and more senior demographic.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Importantly, \"The Blooming Journey\" makes a real-world impact. The show also helped bring new attention to Lugu Lake in Yunnan Province, where visitor numbers rose 42.93% year-on-year during the 2025 National Day Holiday period. Many travelers were inspired by the show to explore local traditions, including sunrise watching and Mosuo cultural experiences.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"The Blooming Journey\" epitomizes iQIYI's ongoing commitment to premium, IP-driven entertainment. Other long-running variety shows – such as \"The Rap of China,\" \"The King of Stand-Up Comedy,\" and \"Become a Farmer\" – further demonstrate iQIYI's leadership in delivering high-quality, diverse content that shapes consumer preferences and boosts local tourism.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">With its strong portfolio of seasonal IP and cross-border format innovation, iQIYI remains at the forefront of China's entertainment landscape, providing fresh perspectives, championing inclusive storytelling, and connecting audiences to the places and cultures they see on screen.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Contact:<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>iQIYI Press, <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:press@qiyi.com\" tabindex=\"0\">press@qiyi.com</a></p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1802392/iQIYI_New_Logo_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1802392/iQIYI_New_Logo_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN12135&amp;sd=2025-10-31\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqiyi-launches-the-blooming-journey-season-2-cementing-its-leadership-in-seasonal-ips-and-female-centric-storytelling-302600689.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqiyi-launches-the-blooming-journey-season-2-cementing-its-leadership-in-seasonal-ips-and-female-centric-storytelling-302600689.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE iQIYI Inc.</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

The agreement covers more than 100 MW of JA Solar's DeepBlue 4.0 Pro modules for a large-scale solar project in Western Australia, marking the largest collaboration to date between the two companies.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2809997/signing_ceremony.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2809997/signing_ceremony.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Built on years of close technical cooperation, this agreement combines the complementary strengths of JA Solar and 5B to deliver greater value for PV developers. JA Solar's high-efficiency modules, renowned for their reliability, have been rigorously tested and optimized for seamless integration with 5B's Maverick system. The Maverick is a prefabricated, re-deployable solar array designed so that solar farms can be built faster, safer, and at lower cost.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Certified to withstand wind speeds of up to 93 meters per second, the Maverick system provides exceptional durability in extreme weather, a timely advantage as Australia enters its peak storm season. When paired with JA Solar's DeepBlue 4.0 Pro modules, the combined solution enables fast-track installation, reduced balance-of-system costs, and consistent energy output. This synergy results in shorter project timelines, lower operational risks, and stronger returns for customers operating in challenging environments.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The signing ceremony brought together senior leaders from both companies, including Daniel Li (VP, East Asia &amp; South Pacific, JA Solar) and David Griffin (CEO of 5B), alongside key regional and technical heads. Their presence highlighted the strategic depth of the partnership and the alignment across commercial, engineering, and market development teams.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"This agreement is more than a supply contract, it is a blueprint for how global technology and local ingenuity can come together to deliver real-world impact,\" said Daniel Li. \"By combining JA Solar's proven module performance with 5B's advanced deployment technology, we are empowering customers with solutions that are bankable, scalable, and built for Australia's unique conditions.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The partnership between JA Solar and 5B reflects a shared vision of accelerating the transition to renewable energy through technical excellence, operational synergy, and deep local collaboration, delivering greater value for the customers who are building the future.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN12092&amp;sd=2025-10-30\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ja-solar-and-5b-sign-strategic-module-supply-agreement-for-100mw-project-in-western-australia-302600658.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ja-solar-and-5b-sign-strategic-module-supply-agreement-for-100mw-project-in-western-australia-302600658.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE JA Solar Technology Co., Ltd.</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

Adjusting the CPI to narrow the impact of inflation to focus specifically on middle-income families and their purchase patterns, inflation rose to 3.4% year over year. The cost of necessity items as used in the HBI™ metric (food, utilities, gas, auto insurance, and health care) for middle-income Americans is up 3.2% year over year.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index™ metric, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.householdbudgetindex.com%2F&amp;esheet=54348430&amp;newsitemid=20251030964186&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.householdbudgetindex.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=92b88b8368b1fc3f22bc025993a7c879\" tabindex=\"0\">www.householdbudgetindex.com</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Note on Availability of Primerica HBI™ Data</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica’s Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) metric is constructed monthly using current and historical government data including information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the U.S. Census Bureau (Census). As a result of the government shutdown that began October 1, 2025, the BLS published the delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Friday, October 24 and release of economic data and active data collection has ceased. Primerica generated September HBI™ data with an estimated value for the Census data that will be updated once the September data becomes available. However, no data collection by the BLS or Census is expected to occur for the month of October, thus Primerica will be unable to release HBI™ data in November. If these circumstances continue, there may be an impact on the timing or content of future HBI™ data. The HBI™ metric will resume once the data is available again.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) Data</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) data is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">®</span>. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, auto insurance, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPrimerica’s HBI™ metric was created to fill an information void around the economy’s impact on middle-income families. Metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure overall inflation but don’t offer a clear picture of how it impacts middle-income Americans. Middle-income households play a key role in driving consumer spending and the overall economy as they account for over 55% of the U.S. population. The purchasing power of middle-income families are a key barometer of real-time economic trends. Understanding middle-income households’ purchasing power is important because it shows whether they are gaining financial ground or falling behind.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe HBI™ data uses January 2019 as its baseline, with the value set to 100% at that point in time.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPeriodically, prior HBI™ values may be modified due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the December 2024 release of the index, the expenditure weights have been updated to the most recent (Q1 2024) data and auto insurance has been added to the group of necessity items.

Its Shenzhen-listed shares dropped 2.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The carmaker late Thursday reported a 33% slide in third-quarter net profit and a 3.05% decline in revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"Considering the unsuccessful smart driving strategy for 2025 and also the latest anti-involution trend in the China auto market, [BYD] is in a challenging phase with its losing market share,\" Nomura analysts said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That said, some analysts are more optimistic on the company's outlook due to its overseas expansion, and project improved operational metrics from the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"We expect sequential improvement in volume, margin and earnings in the fourth quarter, driven by demand recovery in peak season, better product mix and operating leverage,\" HSBC Global Research analysts said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  BYD, known for its wide range of low-cost electric vehicles, has faced pressure this year from Chinese authorities' push to halt a price war in the world's largest auto market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The EV giant's expansion overseas should become another pillar of volume and earnings resilience, the HSBC analysts said. The international segment offers a robust counterbalance to headwinds in the domestic market, they added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  BYD's overseas sales are estimated to surpass 900,000 units this year, doubling from 2024, the HSBC analysts said. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Jiahui Huang at jiahui.huang@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 30, 2025 23:19 ET (03:19 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
