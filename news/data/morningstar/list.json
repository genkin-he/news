(the \"Company\" or \"FRMO\") (OTC Pink:FRMO) reported its financial results for the fiscal year 2026 second quarter ended November 30, 2025.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Financial Highlights</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">FRMO's total book value as of November 30, 2025 was $530.0 million. Excluding the non-controlling interests, equity attributable to shareholders was $293.3 million ($6.66 per share). This compares with total book value at the prior fiscal year end on May 31, 2025 of $617.8 million (as restated). Excluding the non-controlling interests, equity attributable to shareholders was $319.6 million ($7.26 per share) at May 31, 2025 (as restated).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Current assets, comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents, amounted to $46.4 million as of November 30, 2025, and $46.3 million as of May 31, 2025. Total liabilities were $81.8 million as of November 30, 2025, and $95.6 million as of May 31, 2025 (as restated), comprised primarily of deferred taxes and securities sold, not yet purchased.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">FRMO's net loss attributable to the Company for the quarter ended November 30, 2025 was $13.0 million ($0.30 per diluted share), compared to net income of $115.6 million ($2.63 per diluted share) a year earlier. The equity security investment that accounts for the net loss is identified as Investment A in Note 4 of the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Investment Concentration.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For the six months ended November 30, 2025, FRMO's net loss attributable to the Company was $26.4 million ($0.60 per diluted share), compared to net income of $145.0 million ($3.29 per diluted share) a year earlier.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Net loss attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain or loss from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes for the three months ended November 30, 2025 was $7.3 million ($0.17 per diluted share) compared to net income of $46.1 million ($1.05 per diluted share) for the three months ended November 30, 2024 (as restated). The six-month figures, as of the same end dates, are a net loss of $8.6 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in 2025 compared to net income of $53.3 million ($1.21 per diluted share) in 2024 (as restated).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Net income or loss attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain or loss from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes is a measure not based on GAAP and is defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in \"Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\" at the end of this release.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Valuation of securities and digital assets are subject to change after November 30, 2025.

The Company owns 4.42% of HKHC and earns substantially all of its advisory fees from HKHC (see Note 4 - Investments, Investments under the Equity Method of Accounting). Due to the common control and ownership between HKHA and the Company's principal stockholders and directors, HKHA has been consolidated within the Company's financial statements. The noncontrolling interest of 78.23% and 78.12% in HKHA has been eliminated from results of operations for the periods ended November 30, 2025 and November 30, 2024.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Tanner Brown </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Retail sales are still rising, but record household savings, stepped-up gold buying and reined-in income expectations suggest the population of the world's second largest economy is now prioritizing security over splurges - with consequences for global brands and investors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People traversing a walkway at a mall in Beijing in January did not appear overburdened by shopping parcels. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For years, global investors have waited for the Chinese consumer to return in force - to shop, to splurge and to rescue multinational earnings. Instead, what they've gotten is something far more puzzling: steady retail growth on the surface, paired with an extraordinary buildup of household savings underneath. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China's retail sales topped 50 trillion yuan ($7.3 trillion) in 2025, according to official data, with total retail sales of consumer goods rising 3.7% on a year-over-year basis. That is not a picture of collapse. Restaurants are busy again. Domestic travel has rebounded. Electric-vehicle sales remain strong. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And yet Chinese households are still piling up cash. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The World Bank estimates China's household saving rate exceeded 30% of disposable income in 2025 - far higher than rates in most developed economies. Meanwhile, household bank deposits have ballooned to record levels in recent years. By mid-2025, total household deposits exceeded 160 trillion yuan, with trillions more added in just the first half of the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I used to think [that] if my income rose, I should upgrade everything - a bigger apartment, better brands. Now I'd rather keep more money in the bank.'Insurance broker Li Winfeng </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those two trends - moderate consumption growth and massive savings accumulation - can coexist. But they tell a different story than the simple \"China slowdown\" narrative. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What looks like weakness may in fact be caution. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     McKinsey's latest China consumer research shows households expecting only modest income gains and limited increases in spending in 2025. The consumer outlook \"remains at a similarly cautious level as the previous year,\" the firm wrote in its recent China Consumer Report, noting that confidence and willingness to spend have yet to return to prepandemic levels. That caution is not about empty wallets. It's about uncertainty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: A luxury 'phobia' is gripping these consumers. It's a red flag for brands like Chanel and Gucci. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The property downturn looms large. Housing has historically accounted for the majority of household wealth in China. As home prices softened across many cities and developers struggled with debt, the so-called wealth effect weakened. When families feel less wealthy, they tend to rebuild balance sheets rather than stretch them. Mortgage prepayments surged in recent years as households prioritized deleveraging over discretionary consumption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gold offers another clue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China has been one of the world's largest drivers of demand for physical gold over the past two years, and it was the single biggest driver of global gold-demand growth in 2024, the World Gold Council said in a recent report, highlighting robust bar and coin purchases. That isn't typical consumer exuberance. It's precautionary behavior - a hedge against volatility and a signal of capital preservation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Two things that can be true at the same time: Consumption growth has moderated, and there has been a massive accumulation of household savings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Confidence indicators reinforce the pattern. Consumer-confidence readings have remained below long-term averages, reflecting ongoing anxiety about jobs, income stability and asset values. Even as services spending recovers, households appear reluctant to commit to major outlays on homes, high-end goods or large discretionary purchases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For many middle-class families, the shift feels practical rather than pessimistic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I used to think [that] if my income rose, I should upgrade everything - a bigger apartment, better brands,\" said Li Wenfeng, a 34-year-old insurance broker in Hangzhou. \"Now I'd rather keep more money in the bank. You don't know what might happen next.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That sentiment - not panic but prudence - captures the mood reflected in the data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For global brands, the shift matters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A customer displays a gold bar in January before selling it via an automated Smart Gold Store machine in Shanghai. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Luxury executives once relied on Chinese shoppers to deliver double-digit growth. Now, companies talk more about \"value,\" \"localization\" and \"price sensitivity.\" The appetite for consumption hasn't vanished - it has narrowed. Shoppers are selective, comparison-driven and increasingly focused on practicality. Domestic value brands have gained traction, while premium foreign labels face stiffer scrutiny. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Opinion: China is hacking the tariff system by investing in U.S. firms - and American taxpayers foot the bill </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The implications ripple outward. Softer appetite for big-ticket purchases affects commodity demand. Elevated savings support flows into money-market funds and insurance products. Persistent caution tempers expectations for a dramatic consumption-led rebound. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This isn't the story of a cash-strapped population unable to spend. Income growth, while slower than in the boom years, continues. Retail sales are still expanding. Services are recovering. The money exists. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China's consumers aren't broke. They're behaving like households that have lived through a shock and decided not to be caught unprepared again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But households are choosing liquidity over leverage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In that sense, the Chinese consumer story in 2026 is less about stimulus checks or shopping festivals and more about psychology. After a bruising property downturn and years of economic uncertainty, families appear determined to fortify their balance sheets first - and spend later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For investors awaiting a roaring comeback, that may be disappointing. For economists, it may be rational. And for multinational brands that built strategies around ever-rising discretionary demand, it requires recalibration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Opinion: Why Trump's trade war will simmer through the midterms - and boil over in 2027 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China's consumers aren't broke. They're behaving like households that have lived through a shock and decided not to be caught unprepared again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That distinction - subtle but profound - may define the next phase for the world's second-largest consumer market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tanner Brown covers China for MarketWatch and Barron's. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More Tanner Brown dispatches: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Penny pinchers are putting the squeeze on the all-powerful Chinese central government </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     China's reclusive young 'rat people' stay in bed all day and gnaw away at the country's economic prospects </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Weight loss has become the hottest new Chinese consumer craze </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Tanner Brown </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(NYSE: NEE) announced today that it has priced its public offering of $2.00 billion of equity units. The transaction is expected to close on March 3, 2026.</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2804083/NextEra_Energy_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2804083/NextEra_Energy_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">NextEra Energy, Inc. has granted the underwriters an option to purchase during the 13-day period beginning on, and including, the closing date up to an additional aggregate stated amount of $0.30 billion, solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The net proceeds from the sale of the equity units, which are expected to be approximately $1.97 billion (or approximately $2.27 billion if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting discount but before deducting other offering expenses, will be added to the general funds of NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy. NextEra Energy Capital Holdings expects to use its general funds to fund investments in energy and power projects and for other general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of its outstanding commercial paper obligations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Each equity unit will be issued in a stated amount of $50. Each equity unit will consist of a contract to purchase NextEra Energy common stock in the future, and undivided beneficial ownership interests in two series of debentures issued by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, consisting of a Series P Debenture due March 1, 2031, and a Series Q Debenture due March 1, 2034, each with a principal amount of $1,000. The debentures will be guaranteed by NextEra Energy. Total annual distributions on the equity units will be at the rate of 7.375% on the stated amount of $50 per unit, consisting of interest on the debentures and payments under the stock purchase contracts.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In approximately three years, each stock purchase contract will require the holder to purchase NextEra Energy common stock for cash, based on a per-share price range of $91.99 to $115.00. The higher end of this price range reflects a premium of approximately 25% over the New York Stock Exchange closing price of NextEra Energy common stock on Feb. 26, 2026, which was $91.99. The holders of the equity units must complete the stock purchase by no later than Feb. 15, 2029, with the required purchase price of stock purchased on that date determined based on the average closing price of NextEra Energy's common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on Feb. 12, 2029. The holders may satisfy their purchase obligations with proceeds raised from remarketing the debentures that comprise part of their equity units.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Upon settlement of the purchase contract, NextEra Energy will receive cash and will issue the requisite number of shares of its common stock. Before the issuance of NextEra Energy common stock upon settlement of the purchase contracts, the purchase contracts will be reflected in NextEra Energy's diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Wells Fargo Securities, BofA Securities, Citigroup and Mizuho will be joint book-running managers for the offering.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities to which this communication relates in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Management now seems to be acknowledging that it needs to make changes in a rapidly evolving landscape. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company announced some of those Thursday afternoon, alongside fiscal-fourth quarter earnings results. Duolingo's management disclosed that the transition could weigh on financials in the near term but expressed confidence in a long-term payoff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some investors may not be waiting to see how things play out, however, with Duolingo shares off more than 21% in Thursday's extended session. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Duolingo has been trying to integrate AI into its own product offerings, including by letting customers video-chat with an AI-powered animated character and engage in more voice-based AI experiences to test their progress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company announced it will move its core AI product, \"Video Call with Lily,\" to be part of the company's \"Super Duolingo tier\" subscription, down from its more exclusive \"Duolingo Max\" tier. It also announced new AI-powered lesson plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Further, Duolingo will try to respond to a growth slowdown in daily active users by increasing the value proposition of its free tier. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Software stocks bounce as Nvidia shares falter. Is a new rotation trade in store? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Up until now, the main way we've increased bookings per user is by adding small amounts of friction to encourage more people to subscribe, for example by increasing ad load or subscription upsells,\" Duolingo said in a shareholder letter. \"Unfortunately, we believe that this extra friction is part of the reason our DAU growth has slowed, so we've decided to prioritize user growth over monetization.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The moves are expected to come with several financial tradeoffs. For one, the company said in the letter that it expects revenue growth will \"step down sequentially\" in the second and third quarters, before \"stabilizing\" in the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bookings, meanwhile, are expected to grow just 11% this fiscal year, versus an almost 20% growth rate the company said it expected it would see \"if we operated like we have in past years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Profits will also come under pressure as the new moves require heavy investment. Duolingo expects a 25% margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the current fiscal year, versus the 29.5% margin it posted for its just-completed fiscal year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEO Luis von Ahn said in a video message that \"this may seem a little strange if you just look at the next quarter.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But here we're trying to build a company for a very long time,\" he added, and that in the long term, the company's goal is to educate \"billions\" of people. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Salesforce's record $50 billion stock-buyback plan is proving controversial on Wall Street </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Hannah Pedone </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Salad chain is currently testing new wrap sandwiches, offered at lower prices, as diners stay selective on spending </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle have been dealing with discounted competition from fast-food and sit-down dining chains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A day after Cava's upbeat sales forecast raised hopes for the restaurant industry, rival fast-casual chain Sweetgreen is bringing them back to earth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen (SG) on Thursday forecast another year of falling same-store sales and said it would accelerate plans to turn itself around, as it deals with budget-conscious consumers and aggressive competition and discounting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The fast-casual salad chain, in a statement, said the results came up short of even its own expectations. Those results arrived just two days after Sweetgreen launched new wrap sandwiches, priced a bit lower than some of its bowls and salads, after more expensive fare kept some customers away last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Sweetgreen (SG) were down 7% after hours on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The drop in Sweetgreen's stock price came after shares of rival Cava (CAVA) rocketed higher on Wednesday, following a forecast for a same-store sales gain this year. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain's CEO said customers could be getting tired of chasing discounts. However, other chains, like McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG), have been more tempered in their expectations for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Cava were down 0.6% after hours Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen's management on Thursday said it would move ahead with more urgency to strengthen service standards, introduce new menu items and speed up checkout times. It also plans to improve marketing around things like high-quality ingredients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     CEO Jonathan Neman said that the company was currently testing new wrap sandwiches, which it introduced on Tuesday in parts of New York, the Midwest and California. If those items do well, he said Sweetgreen plans to expand the offerings beyond that trial run in the middle of the year. The prices for those wraps start at $10.95. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sweetgreen said fourth-quarter sales fell 3.5% to $155.2 million, with a per-share loss of 42 cents. Both figures were worse than analysts expected. Same-stores sales were down 11.5%, which weren't as bad as anticipated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The chain said it expects same-store sales to fall 2% to 4% this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the past year, fast-casual restaurants - which try to offer the quality of a sit-down chain at the speed of fast food - have been squeezed by value offerings from rivals like Chili's and McDonald's. Against that backdrop, Sweetgreen's stock is down 73.5% over the past 12 months. Over recent months, consumers have showed signs of waning interest in often-pricey salad and bowl offerings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ahead of the results, UBS analysts said Sweetgreen faced concerns over spending among younger consumers, who make up about a third of the people who visit the chain. They also noted that the chain has struggled in cities like Los Angeles and areas in the Northeast. During an earnings call in November, Sweetgreen said New York was its \"most challenged market.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many restaurants, after raising prices to cover for the past several years of supply shocks, are now trying to find ways to cut them after scaring customers away. But the discount war has weighed on margins and, in some cases, stock prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 13, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants had overstated CoreWeave's ability to meet customer demand for its service; (2) defendants materially understated the scope and severity of the risk that CoreWeave's reliance on a single third-party data center supplier presented for CoreWeave's ability to meet customer demand for its services; (3) the foregoing was reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on CoreWeave's revenue; (4) as a result, CoreWeave's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the CoreWeave class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628825-1&amp;h=1436079849&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50571&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50571\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50571</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.
