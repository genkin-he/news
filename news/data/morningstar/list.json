            "title": "Hotel stays now can easily cost $100 extra, thanks to local 'bed taxes'",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some locales, like Kyoto and San Diego, are increasing the taxes they levy on visitors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These days, local taxes can easily add more than $100 to the bill for a hotel stay - and the businesses don't even get the money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your hotel bill may soon be getting higher - and it could have nothing to do with the room rate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A number of cities are upping the taxes they levy on hotel guests. The add-on expense, sometimes referred to as a \"bed tax\" or \"tourist tax,\" can equate to hundreds of dollars in certain instances, depending on the locale and how long a guest stays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example: In Washington, D.C., the hotel tax now stands at 15.95%, following a slight increase approved by city officials in 2022 that was recently extended to September 2027. For a four-night stay at a hotel that charges $216 a night - the average daily D.C. room rate, according to CoStar, a real-estate analytics company - that comes out to $138 in bed taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But it can get more expensive in other markets: In Kyoto, one of Japan's most popular tourist destinations, a new bed-tax rate that is set to go into effect next March adds as much as $65 a night to a hotel stay. That translates into a $455 add-on for a week's visit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other municipalities that have hopped on the bed tax-hike bandwagon include San Diego (from 10.5% up to 13.75%); Aurora, Ill. (from 3% to 6%); and Oklahoma City (from 5.5% to 9.25%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's no secret why cities levy these taxes and often opt to increase them: It's a way of raising revenue without tapping local residents for more. And the money generated, which can total millions of dollars over time, is often tied to tourism, as in marketing campaigns designed to attract visitors to the destination. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, no visitor likes paying these taxes, but cities are hopeful that the amounts will be small enough that it won't stop tourists from coming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You don't want to discourage usage,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Holt noted that the city made sure that its bed-tax rate wouldn't be out of line compared to competing municipalities. \"We did all the research,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A similar point was raised by tourism officials with Washington, D.C., who said that the city's 15.95% bed-tax rate is still lower than or on par with a number of prominent municipalities across the country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Indeed, a 2024 study from the U.S. Travel Association, in partnership with consulting firm Civitas, found the average lodging levy to be 15.22%. That's up from 14.52% in 2018. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amanda Belarmino, a tourism expert who teaches at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's William F. Harrah College of Hospitality, said the increase in bed-tax rates may be partly due to the pandemic and the need for cities to make up for lost revenue. But she said other factors are also at play, including the aforementioned hard-to-ignore reality that it's \"more politically popular\" to stick tourists with a tax hike than locals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But will tourists push back at some point and just avoid visiting because of higher bed taxes? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We have not seen a lot of evidence of 'sticker shock' as of yet,\" Belarmino said. But she didn't rule out the possibility that some of the recent nationwide decline in tourism, especially among foreign visitors, could be attributable to traveler frustration with taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Milos Eric, co-founder of OysterLink, a hospitality-job platform, believes hotels in certain locales are definitely taking a hit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In some of the most popular cities with the biggest taxes, we're seeing more travelers shift to alternative accommodations or to the suburbs to keep their overall price down on the stay,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another point of concern among travelers: Bed taxes are not always fully made known - at least at first glance - when looking at room rates online. That is, you might see a posted rate for the room itself, but when you go to book, you'll find the add-on expenses, which can include taxes as well as those ubiquitous resort fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's frustrating that some platforms are fully transparent while others hide additional charges until checkout, making it hard to compare costs accurately,\" said Caroline Morse Teel, executive editor of the SmarterTravel website. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "title": "World Series Game 7: Why betting companies like DraftKings are rooting for the Blue Jays to win tonight",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Weston Blasi </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One sportsbook had 96.7% of World Series bets on the Dodgers to beat the Blue Jays once the matchup was finalized </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most sports bettors want the Dodgers to win the World Series. Sportsbooks are praying for the Blue Jays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tonight, the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win their first MLB World Series since 1993. And U.S. sportsbooks hope that they win, too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's because the Los Angeles Dodgers were heavily favored to beat Toronto in the series. In fact, once this year's World Series matchup was finalized, almost every single bet (96.7%) made on ESPN Bet over which team would win the World Series was made in favor of the Dodgers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The wagers have been driven by the Dodgers' popularity as reigning champions and as home to one of the best players in baseball, Shohei Ohtani. And this type of overwhelming liability could lead to a bad outcome for sports-betting companies if the Blue Jays don't win and the sportsbooks have to pay up - again. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Betting companies are already coming off a football season where FanDuel owner Flutter (FLUT) took a $370 million hit on NFL games after casual bettors benefited from some of the most \"customer-friendly\" betting outcomes that online sportsbooks have ever seen. So while a Toronto win would mean paying out some long-shot futures, it would still be a far better result for the betting operators than another Dodgers victory - which would trigger huge payouts on the most bet-on team all season. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sportsbooks typically favor outcomes that go against the majority of wagers placed on a sporting event, which is why nearly all of them are pulling for the Blue Jays right now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Before the World Series began, the Blue Jays winning it all was a good outcome for the sportsbook,\" Seamus Magee, trading manager at BetMGM, told MarketWatch in an email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But sports-betting companies are glad that the Dodgers have given them a run for their money. \"Toronto is still the preferred winner, but we wouldn't mind seeing a Game 7,\" Magee added - the day before the Dodgers  pulled off a crucial double play toward the end of Game 6 that pushed the series into a seventh game. Sportsbooks generally prefer longer series, because more games equals more bets - and more juice for the sportsbooks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the Blue Jays winning the whole thing would provide a lifeline to betting companies. \"We definitely need the Blue Jays. Toronto winning would be a strong result for us,\" Caesars Sports head of baseball trading Eric Biggio told Fox. \"If you know of any Blue Jays backers with deep pockets, you can send them our way.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The two most popular individual prop bets on BetMGM for Game 6 on Halloween night were Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hitting over 0.5 home runs (+400), and Ohtani hitting over 0.5 home runs (+195). The biggest liability for World Series MVP - as in, the players who sportsbooks least want to see win the award - are Ohtani, Guerrero Jr. and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, in that order. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition to ESPN Bet (DIS), BetMGM (MGM) and Caesars (CZR), other U.S. sportsbooks were also showing an overwhelming amount of bets on the Dodgers heading into Game 6. But it's not just bets that were made in the days leading up to the World Series; fans have been backing the Dodgers all year long. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From the archives: How does a gambling site lose money? DraftKings just lost $250 million in revenue - mostly on NFL games. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Toronto opened the season at +6000 odds to win the World Series before the season (1.6% implied probability of winning), while the Dodgers went into the season at roughly +750 odds. In other words, expectations were low for Toronto heading into the year, and high for the Dodgers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even with those long-shot odds for Toronto, sportsbooks would rather pay out those bets than face the heavy losses that would occur with a Dodgers series win. That's because the Dodgers were the most wagered-on team in terms of total futures bets, and in total money at nearly every major sportsbook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to betting data from DraftKings (DKNG), at the start of the MLB playoffs, 36% (or over 1 in 3) of all World Series winner bets were made for the Dodgers - more than triple the amount of bets on the next most wagered-on team. The Dodgers also had 22% of all money wagered (otherwise known as handle) to win the World Series. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More bets were on the Los Angeles Dodgers than any other team to win the 2025 World Series. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's not clear exactly how much sportsbooks would lose if the Dodgers were to win tonight, as the ones mentioned in this story declined to comment on potential loss amounts or betting figures. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several members of the r/BlueJays subreddit have begun sharing that they placed small wagers on their team to win the World Series at long odds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"That $20, +6000 bet I put pre-season on winning the WS is looking a lot more realistic,\" one Reddit user posted before the playoffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I grabbed it at +7500!\" another user wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sportsbooks typically profit from the \"vig,\" their commission on each bet. However, their strategy involves more than just balancing wagers. When a popular team, such as the Dodgers or Yankees, is heavily favored, sportsbooks adjust the odds to encourage betting on the underdog to minimize their risk. Despite this, sometimes bettors still take the favorite - and win. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Unfavorable sports-betting outcomes can really hurt sportsbooks' bottom lines. For example, FanDuel, the Flutter Entertainment sportsbook, took a $74 million loss during a regular-season NFL game between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers, which ended in a 40-34 win for the favored Lions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For sportsbooks, the stakes are high and their rooting interest is clear: They're all in on the Blue Jays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Sportsbooks were called 'victims' in new NBA gambling probe.

Many Americans may turn to high-deductible plans this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     High-deductible health plans can seem like an attractive option for health-insurance shoppers looking to lower their monthly premium  payments. But consumers should consider their health status and cash savings before making the switch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As open enrollment for 2026 health-insurance plans begins Nov. 1, millions of Americans are bracing for premium hikes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Health insurers that sell policies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare, are charging 26% more on average next year, according to nonprofit research group KFF. Employers are also bracing for higher insurance costs, with the average cost of healthcare per worker expected to jump 6.5%, according to a survey from the human-resource advisory firm Mercer. That would be the biggest surge since 2010.  As a result, employees will likely face higher paycheck deductions or more out-of-pocket spending on deductibles or copays, according to Mercer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With premiums on the rise and changes coming to the ACA marketplace, KFF says more people may opt for high-deductible health plans, trading lower monthly premiums for higher upfront costs and the benefit of a tax-advantaged health savings accounts (known as HSAs) - which are typically offered to people who sign up for high-deductible plans. But, according to experts, holders of these high-deductible policies must be financially prepared to cover unexpected health costs, and the best insurance plan for you can vary based on your health status and tax bracket. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People make their insurance decisions based on how they expect to use their healthcare next year, which is tough because it's impossible to forecast healthcare needs, said Drew Shockley, co-founder of health-insurance-planning firm Move Health. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If someone says, 'I'm thinking about getting pregnant and I'm going to have a baby next year?' OK, we can plan for that,\" Shockley said. \"But no one says, 'I think I'm going to have a heart attack next year.' How do we plan for that?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As the financial stakes rise, here's what you need to know to be a savvy health-insurance shopper as open enrollment begins, from the potential downsides of high-deductible health plans to changes in the ACA marketplace. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More ACA plans now come with health savings accounts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, reclassified Bronze and Catastrophic ACA plans as high-deductible plans, making them eligible for an HSA in 2026. Information about different coverage tiers is available on Healthcare.gov. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts for medical expenses that can accumulate funds through contributions. They can be invested after reaching a minimum. These accounts are often seen as retirement vehicles because they can grow over time, and after age 65, that money can be withdrawn for nonmedical expenses without penalty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For your plan to be eligible for an HSA, it must have a deductible of at least $1,700 for individual coverage and $3,400 for families, according to Fidelity. (The deductible is the amount of money you have to pay for healthcare before your insurance starts covering some costs.) The HSA contribution limits in 2026 are $4,400 for an individual and $8,750 for family coverage. Those 55 and older who are not enrolled in Medicare can contribute an additional $1,000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ask yourself these questions before getting a high-deductible plan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Determining if a high-deductible plan is right for you is largely dependent on your health status and income. Ask yourself the following questions to avoid a future unexpected medical bill you can't pay off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What are my expected healthcare needs for the year? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is one of the questions Todd Calamita, a Charlotte, N.C.-based certified financial planner, asked himself before he and his wife switched to a high-deductible plan a decade ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you're generally healthy, require only preventive care and don't anticipate frequent doctor visits or medications, the lower premiums of an HDHP (high-deductible health plan) can make sense,\" Calamita said. \"However, if you manage chronic conditions or need ongoing prescriptions, an HDHP may be less cost-effective.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, if you go to therapy or a psychiatrist regularly, those visits must be paid out-of-pocket until you hit the deductible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Are online pharmacies cheaper than your local drugstore? How to decide what's best for your healthcare - and your wallet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're generally healthy, consider pairing a high-deductible plan with going to a direct-primary-care doctor to get your basic primary care, said Dr. Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and financial planner. Direct-primary-care providers charge patients a monthly, quarterly or annual fee in lieu of insurance billing for unlimited visits and clinical and laboratory services, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You'll have to pay a subscription fee, but they can provide a lot of what you need that will be way less than your deductible,\" McClanahan said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do I have enough cash to cover the full deductible if needed? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Be comfortable with the possibility of large upfront medical bills because of out-of-pocket costs until the deductible is met. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I quietly chuckle when a doctor's office tells me, 'Don't worry, it's covered by insurance,'\" Calamita said. \"Because I know that I first have to hit $8,300 out-of-pocket cost.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Does it make sense for someone in my tax bracket to use an HSA? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSAs come with a \"triple tax benefit\" - contributions are tax-deductible, funds grow tax-free and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax-free. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because of these benefits, the higher a person's marginal tax bracket is, the more they save up front. For example, a person in the 35% tax bracket - who earns between $256,225 and $640,600 in 2026 - saves 35 cents on every dollar contributed, making the tax deduction more valuable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The new IRS tax brackets for 2026 are here. See where you fit in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Low-income earners can still use HSAs as a vehicle for paying current medical bills with pretax dollars, but it's less valuable as a long-term wealth-building account. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Participating in a health savings account is a lower priority for someone in a lower tax bracket,\" Shockley said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How to be a savvy HSA user </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For those looking at a HSA as a retirement account, Houston, Texas-based certified financial planner Crystal McKeon recommended prioritizing 401(k) contributions if the plan involves an employer match. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You want to get all of that match because you're doubling your money almost, depending on what your employer's match is,\" McKeon said. \"So for me, that's almost always the first place you go for savings.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After contributing up to the employer match, she said, prioritizing the 401(k) versus the HSA depends on which investments are more beneficial. If they're generally the same, McKeon recommended prioritizing making contributions to the HSA because of the triple-tax benefits. Traditional 401(k) withdrawals are generally taxed as ordinary income. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Most Americans are falling behind in saving for retirement. Here's how they can make up the difference. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond saving in the long term, a savvy way to use an HSA is by paying out of pocket for qualified expenses and reimbursing yourself later from the HSA account. This can be particularly effective when you don't have your HSA debit card on you or if you received a medical bill larger than your HSA balance and you want to reimburse yourself over time as your balance grows, according to Fidelity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You might also prefer to use a rewards credit card on qualified expenses to rack up points and then reimburse yourself with HSA funds later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     HSA-qualified expenses include over-the-counter medications, menstrual products, postpartum care, healthcare-related travel, family planning and substance-abuse treatments, according to MetLife (MET). The One Big Beautiful Bill Act also made direct-primary-care fees qualified HSA medical expenses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Health insurance is just that. It's insurance against bad things happening,\" McKeon said. \"Whereas if you're able to combine it with a savings feature ... it's not just a safeguard against an emergency; it's actually planning for the long term as well, which I think is a great combination.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's who is facing the biggest jump in ACA premiums </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The biggest ACA-related issue tied up in the current budget fight is whether Congress will extend the enhanced premium tax credits first expanded under the American Rescue Plan and set to expire at the end of 2025. Without an extension, those expanded subsidies - which currently help Americans earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level afford marketplace coverage - would lapse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is barreling toward a terrible record. These financial pain points could end it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An individual earning $62,600 a year, or a family of four making $128,600, represents 400% of the federal poverty level in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. About 1 to 2 million people could lose eligibility for the enhanced subsidies at the end of the year, Shockley said - a relatively small slice of the roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees who now receive financial help. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     People making below 400% of the federal poverty level will still qualify for tax credits, but anyone earning even a small amount over the income cap would have to pay the full cost of a marketplace plan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're literally just going back to the original regulations that the Obama administration put in place in 2014,\" Shockley said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  11-01-25 1023ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

A zero-interest program means no interest is charged at all during the relief period, while an accrued-interest program pauses payments but continues adding interest in the background, which you'll still owe later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's essential to get details about the hardship program in writing, as well as contact information for a person at the financial institution who can answer questions.

It can also fall on the consumer to figure out if late fees will be waived during this time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A big danger that comes with mortgage forbearance is a potential balloon payment - when a lump sum of missed payments is owed at the end of a forbearance period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you have to pay a balloon payment at the end of the forbearance and you can't afford that, that could put you in a much more difficult situation,\" Cohen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Luckily, the current standard for many government-backed loans is to extend the term of the mortgage for the number of months missed. For instance, if you missed seven payments during forbearance, the loan is extended by seven months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: A government shutdown would hurt home-buying deals just as buyers are coming off the sidelines </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Keep in mind that interest payments are not paused during the forbearance period, \"but if you're trying to keep your home and stay in your mortgage and you could afford to resume the payments, it's a modest price to pay for getting the forgiveness.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Homeowners also need to stay on top of the forbearance timeline. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"People should find out if they're going to be notified when the forbearance ends or when they have to call to extend it and whether that's on them,\" Cohen said. \"They should have a whole calendar set up so they understand what the timeline is for their arrangement with their lender.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prioritize the roof over your head - but keep in mind these credit risks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lenders reporting payments to credit-reporting bureaus typically mark deferred payments for consumers enrolled in hardship programs with a special code indicating \"no information\" or \"deferral,\" which does not hurt their credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, this is an industry standard rather than legally binding law, so lenders can ignore it, resulting in negative marks for consumers, said Chi Chi Wu, the director of consumer reporting and data advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: This government shutdown could be the longest ever - maybe running until Thanksgiving. What might the economic damage be? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because the guidance isn't enforceable, a consumer's ability to fix the inaccurate negative credit reporting is limited and difficult. Consumers can be proactive by getting all hardship terms in writing to protect their credit, but the risk remains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Wu said, those facing dire straits due to the shutdown should prioritize essential needs like their mortgage or rent over immediate credit preservation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If your back is against the wall and you don't have enough money to pay all of your bills as a federal worker, pay the bills that are the most important, credit be damned,\" Wu said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Think long term </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With continuing uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last, Kates said, it's important to map out a plan beyond the relief options offered by your financial institution. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most programs, like those that allow borrowers to defer a single payment, are designed to offer short-term shutdown assistance and assume the worker's income will stabilize after a few weeks. Many are not built to defer multiple payments or several months' worth of fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is reaching a tipping point that could send the economy into a downward spiral </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To brace for the possibility of a longer-than-expected shutdown, consumers using hardship programs may need to look into secondary resources that can provide a \"backstop,\" he said. \"The job doesn't end by entering one program.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond financial institutions, the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund provides a list of additional resources. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over a million employees going without pay </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About 670,000 federal employees are furloughed and 730,000 are working without pay, the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates. If the shutdown extends to December, 4.5 million paychecks will be withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21 billion in missing wages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Military servicemembers are at risk of going without their first paycheck on Friday, according to the organization, which would be the first time in history that all military members go unpaid due to a shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The American Bankers Association has compiled a noncomprehensive list of banks of all sizes that are offering relief options for federal employees, which has received 35,000 page views so far, according to the trade group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Are you a federal worker not getting paid during the government shutdown? 4 ways to protect your finances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As of Tuesday, 81% of American credit unions were offering deferred payments on existing loans and 71% had launched new or modified relief programs, according to the trade group American Credit Unions. More than half are waiving fees or penalties and offering financial counseling or budget-management support. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sen.
