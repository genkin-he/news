            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'We're going to destroy their missiles,' says Trump </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A plume of smoke rises following a reported explosion in Tehran on Feb. 28, 2026. Two loud blasts were heard in Tehran on Feb. 28 morning by AFP journalists, and two plumes of thick smoke were seen over the center and east of the Iranian capital. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors roiled for weeks by AI disruption and then hotter-than-expected inflation on Friday faced a fresh level of stress after the U.S. and Israel launched attacks on Iran to destabilize its nuclear ambitions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,\" President Donald Trump said in a video message published on his Truth Social account early Saturday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse of how investors might react, until Asian markets open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) slid 3.1% to $63,561, a level not seen since early February. Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes could be nearing, with Trump suggesting to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. The S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP  and Dow industrials DJIA tumbled on Friday after a surprise spike in producer prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump last week offered a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, which left this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike. Iran has been one of the world's biggest oil producers, controlling to several crucial \"chokepoints,\" such as the Strait of Hormuz. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In his social-media post, Trump did not indicate how long the strikes would last. The Associated Press reported a daylight Saturday attack on Tehran, with initial blasts hitting near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump said in his post that after the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, Iran was warned never to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the U.S. \"sought repeatedly to make a deal.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions and we can't take it anymore. Instead they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe and could soon reach the American homeland,\" Trump said in his address. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,\" he said, recounting \"an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder\" against the U.S. over 47 years, as well as attacks on Israel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We're going to annihilate their navy, we're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Addressing the people of Iran - thousands of protesters were killed during protests at the start of the year - Trump also said the U.S. was giving them their \"only chance for generations\" to rise up against their government. He advised citizens in Iran to stay sheltered as \"bombs will be dropping everywhere,\" but after that they would have that opportunity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now is the time to seize control of your destiny,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Myra P. Saefong contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Recalling a time when \"China was still catching up with the rest of the world,\" Khan said he is struck by the \"consistency of effort\" seen today. \"People work hard and they also cherish family, tradition and festivals,\" he said. \"There's a balance between ambition and humanity.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For Khan, China is a living model where \"science serves society, innovation lifts communities, and progress is measured not just in patents or GDP, but in human dignity.\" \"That's the beauty of China,\" he remarked.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Foreign experts framed their expectations for the upcoming Two Sessions within this broader context of balanced and human-centric development.

He said recent policies focus on regional integration initiatives like the coordinated development of the \"Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei\" region and \"Yangtze River Delta,\" signaling China's clear intention to build collaborative innovation ecosystems rather than isolated \"peaks\" of scientific excellence.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">He welcomed the ongoing establishment of an open governance framework grounded in clear rules. \"Clear rules inspire far greater confidence for long-term collaboration than ambiguous discretion,\" Faiola said.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Regarding the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030), Faiola observed that China's commitment to international collaboration is evolving from \"one-way introduction\" to a deeper model of \"two-way exchange\" and \"joint ecosystem building.\" Chinese scientists are already taking a leading role in global discussions on ethical standards for stem cell research, marking a shift from \"participant\" to \"contributor.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Building on this positive momentum, Faiola anticipates continued empowerment for major international scientific programs jointly led by Chinese and foreign teams. Citing global research on emerging pollutants as a prime example, he said such collaborations will significantly enhance China's growing influence in shaping the global scientific agenda.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Confident in the ecosystem's current vitality, Faiola highlighted its proven ability to provide a complete pathway \"from curiosity-driven research to real-world impact,\" empowering global talent to translate discoveries into solutions for shared human challenges.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Extending this vision of systemic strength to the critical field of sustainability, Muhammad Salman Nasir, a 37-year-old Pakistani scholar and associate professor at Tianjin University, said China is already \"playing a pivotal role in advancing global carbon neutrality.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Nasir highlighted China's key strength: its ability to \"integrate national policy with academic and industrial innovation, enabling rapid scaling of technologies like green hydrogen, solar fuels, and carbon capture.\" He described China's research system, marked by strategic funding, interdisciplinary collaboration, and effective pilot-to-industry pathways, as a valuable model for other nations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Regarding the 15th Five-Year Plan, Nasir expressed confidence that proposals for building a new energy system and developing a circular economy will further reinforce these strengths, enabling China to continue leading global efforts in sustainable technological innovations and offering a replicable blueprint for the world's green transition.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The perspectives of the three experts illustrate a comprehensive expectation that the Two Sessions will not only refine the mechanisms of scientific collaboration and green development but also continue to foster the unique harmony that makes China's path to modernization so distinct.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"> </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN97645&amp;sd=2026-02-28\"/></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foreign-experts-chinas-innovation-ecosystem-to-benefit-the-world-302700151.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foreign-experts-chinas-innovation-ecosystem-to-benefit-the-world-302700151.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Science and Technology Daily</p></span>\n</div>",

Through this office, the opinions of local residents gathered by legislators were relayed to higher levels and taken into consideration during the legislation process.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Shanghai neighborhood has come to epitomize the country's whole-process people's democracy following a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping in November 2019, when he coined the term for the first time.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As of 2025, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee had established 54 such outreach offices across the country, and there were more than 7,800 such offices established by provincial or municipal legislatures. These platforms have served as vital bridges between residents and lawmakers, ensuring that democratic participation is embedded in the legislative process.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">While Western democracies often equate democracy with elections, China's whole-process people's democracy ensures public participation throughout the entire process of governance, covering all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society. This approach fosters broad and continuous participation, ensuring that governance decisions reflect the collective will and evolving needs of society.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Extensive participation</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">China's whole-process people's democracy integrates democratic practices across all government levels and at every stage of policymaking – from election and consultation to decision-making, implementation and oversight.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">It is embodied in the Two Sessions – the annual meetings of China's top legislature, the NPC and the top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

From May 20 to June 20 last year, China launched an online public consultation to gather opinions for its next five-year plan. The initiative drew over 3.11 million valid submissions, yielding more than 1,500 constructive suggestions across 27 topics.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A summary of these findings was reviewed by Xi and submitted to the Party leadership, ensuring that citizens' voices were heard at the highest level.

Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Paysafe's ecommerce business had significant exposure to a single high risk client; (2) as a result, Paysafe's credit loss reserves and/or write-offs were understated; (3) Paysafe had an undisclosed issue with higher risk Merchant Category Codes, making its client services difficult to bank; (4) the foregoing issues were likely to have a material negative impact on Paysafe's revenue growth and overall revenue mix; (5) as a result, Paysafe was unlikely to meet its own previously issued financial guidance for fiscal year 2025; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Paysafe's  business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
