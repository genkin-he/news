            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of KB Insurance Co., Ltd.</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">AM Best</strong> has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a” (Excellent) of KB Insurance Co., Ltd. (KBI) (South Korea). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect KBI’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. The ratings also reflect the support that the company receives from its parent, KB Financial Group Inc. (KB Group) and its strategic importance to the parent.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nKBI’s risk-adjusted capitalisation is assessed at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s local solvency ratio remains largely in line with the industry average amid an unfavourable business environment, such as a decline in market interest rates and discount rate cuts by the local regulator. KBI exhibited good accessibility to the capital market underpinned by its recent and past successful issuances of subordinated debts, and maintains low debt leverage and healthy coverage ratios. The company’s investment strategy remains conservative, with a focus on asset liability management.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAM Best assesses KBI’s operating performance as adequate, with its return-on-equity and combined ratios being largely in line with its domestic industry peers. The company’s major business line of long-term insurance is expected to be supported by the release of its large contractual service margin base, albeit facing headwinds in its profitability from an industry-wide increase in medical claims during 2025. While the auto line experiences some negative underwriting pressure, due to the cumulative effect of prior base rate cuts and inflation on repair costs, KBI remains focused on growing its online channel to improve its auto line profitability. This KBI hopes to achieve by economies of scale, despite the potential increase in expenses over the short term amid strong market competition. Interest income remains a major source of the company’s investment profits.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of KB Group, one of the largest financial holding companies in South Korea, KBI remains the fourth-largest non-life insurer in the country with a stable market share of approximately 13% based on gross insurance service revenue in 2024. Strategically, KBI is important to the parent in terms of business diversification, since it is the only non-life insurer within the group. Since its affiliation into KB Group in 2015, KBI has a track record of receiving explicit support including direct capital support and a no-dividend policy between 2019 and 2022, to bolster its capitalisation. Implicit support includes shared distribution channels and group-wide marketing activities under the KB Group brand in both domestic and overseas markets.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nNegative rating actions could occur if there is a significant deterioration in KBI’s balance sheet strength fundamentals or if support from KB Group is reduced to a degree that no longer supports the current level of enhancement. Positive rating actions could occur if KBI’s operating performance demonstrates strong and consistent results to positively distinguish itself from industry peers.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

Analyzing 5,873 safety liability accidents in China over 20 years, the researchers found that doubling PM<span data-v-479a2324=\"\">2.5 </span>concentrations led to a 2.6-fold increase in accident probability, 37% more deaths, and 51% more casualties.

A new study reveals that polluted air can make industrial accidents both more likely and more severe, adding a hidden layer to their human and economic costs.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The research—led by Dr. Ning Zhang of Yonsei University in South Korea, in collaboration with Dr. Zaikun Hou of Shandong University and Dr. Huan Chen of the University of Cambridge—was published in <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4546215-1&amp;h=3706667197&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2FS0140988325007212%3Fvia%253Dihub&amp;a=Energy+Economics\" tabindex=\"0\">Energy Economics</a></em> on September 18, 2025.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Using two decades of accident records from 2000 to 2020, the team matched each incident with local air pollution and weather data.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Things in 2025 turned out quite different than how investors feared after the election a year ago </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given the challenges AI is generating in the job market, Gen Z feels like it can only sustain its standard of living by investing in risk assets like stocks and crypto. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One year ago, as America was preparing for its hugely consequential presidential election, Bank of America's fund-management survey identified the three risks that troubled investors most for 2025. These were fears of a disorderly increase in U.S. government bond yields, the prospect of a trade war between the world's two military and economic superpowers, and the Fed tightening monetary policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The world looked like a very different place at the end of 2024 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fast forward one year, and Michael Hartnett's weekly Flow Show report notes mark that U.S. Treasury volatility is at its lowest level since 2021 with 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y recently dipping below 4%. Additionally, the U.S and China have struck a trade agreement featuring a 12-month truce on of tariffs, and, with the stock market setting record highs, the Fed has cut rates twice, with consensus still favoring further cuts into 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury volatility falls to its lowest level since 2021. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As investors enter the home stretch of 2025, the mindset is still skewed toward risk-on, buttressed by three unofficial \"puts\" that they believe establish a floor for risk-asset prices. Chief strategist Hartnett argued that those supporting struts are provided by the Fed (the promise of lower rates if the economy weakens); President Donald Trump (who feels it incumbent upon him to keep the stock market up to maintain his popularity ahead of midterm elections); and what Hartnett labeled the \"Gen Z put.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hartnett said this generation can only sustain its standard of living - in the face of AI-induced job losses - by sticking with its bid for risk, such as stocks and crypto. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hartnett emphasized that the stock market and crypto are terribly important for Gen Z to maintain their standard of living. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What could derail this seemingly impregnable positivity? Hartnett and his team said that inflation rising toward 4% would represent the biggest threat, because it would imperil the 81 separate rate cuts from a range of central banks, which Bank of America anticipates in 2026. By comparison, central banks have cut rates 129 times so far this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For now, the recommended strategy is that \"AI equity leadership ain't budging for the time being.\" Hartnett maintained gold (GC00)and China stocks MCHI as his preferred \"boom/ bubble hedges.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The contrarian trade at this juncture, Hartnett suggested, is to bet on a surprise tightening of financial conditions in the fourth quarter. He also remarked that investors should short hyperscaler bonds in 2026 because their spreads over U.S Treasurys are probably the tightest they will ever be, and AI capex - as illustrated by Meta's (META) bumper $30 billion bond deal this week - will be paid for not just out of revenues and cash flow, but also increasingly by debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A D.A. Davidson analyst 'would not be surprised' if Palantir splits its stock, given that it caters heavily to retail investors and has seen a strong rally </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir reports earnings on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's been a quiet year for stock-split announcements among big companies, but momentum has picked up this week with ServiceNow Inc. and Netflix Inc. planning moves of their own. Will Palantir Technologies Inc. be next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's something retail investors are watching for, according to Investor's Business Daily's coverage of a recent note from RBC Capital Markets. And D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told MarketWatch that while he didn't have any specific knowledge of a Palantir (PLTR) split announcement on the horizon, he \"would not be surprised\" if Palantir opted to pursue one, given that the stock caters largely to individual investors and has seen a big run-up in recent years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A stock split is also a sign of confidence Palantir could decide to send the market,\" Luria said in emailed comments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir didn't immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment on a potential split. The company reports third-quarter earnings on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The merits of stock splits are debatable now that fractional trading has become commonplace. Before that, high stock prices were viewed as relatively inaccessible to individual investors, but now investors who don't have, say, $5,000-plus to drop on a share of Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) can still get in on the action. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Management teams still cite accessibility when announcing splits, however. The CEO of ServiceNow (NOW), which is planning a 5-for-1 split of its stock that has been trading near $900, told MarketWatch earlier this week that a lower price will \"make it easy\" for \"consumer investors\" to get more involved with the shares. And Netflix (NFLX), which plans a 10-for-1 split of its $1,000-plus stock, said on Thursday that the new price will be \"more accessible to employees who participate in the company's stock-option program.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Netflix plans 10-for-1 stock split that will take its price below $1,000 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cboe Global Markets analysts said in a 2022 report that splits can \"drive additional participation from retail investors\" but do not \"necessarily increase liquidity or attract investors' interest proportionally to the ratio at which the security was split,\" based on a look at split data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prior to the respective announcements from ServiceNow and Netflix on Wednesday and Thursday, things had been relatively subdued on the split front in 2025, with just three effective splits among S&amp;P 500 SPX components versus 18 last year in an unusually active period, according to recent data from Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Companies tend to split their stocks during bull markets,\" Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick told MarketWatch earlier this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Palantir's stock has seen a particularly strong run, having opened at $10 following a direct listing in September 2020. Five years later, the stock is nearing $200, and it's up 157% in 2025 alone, enough to rank fifth among S&amp;P 500 gainers on the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from MarketWatch: Palantir has a high bar to clear this earnings season. Can it deliver again? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
