            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Ed Frankl </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The eurozone economy grew more than expected in the three months through September as it adjusted to higher U.S. tariffs, and recent surveys show tentative signs of a German-led recovery as a tumultuous year draws to a close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Gross domestic product in the 20-nation eurozone increased 0.2% in the third quarter compared with a 0.1% rise in the second and a 0.6% jump in the first, European Union data agency Eurostat said Thursday. Annualized eurozone growth was 0.9%, from 0.5% in second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  That was a little better than expectations from a consensus of economists, but still reflects the drag on economic growth from weaker exports to the U.S. after President Trump ramped up tariffs at the start of the second quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  There are some signs of a revival as the adjustment to higher tariffs on eurozone exports advances. The area's composite purchasing managers' index, which tracks around 5,000 companies in the manufacturing and services sectors, showed activity among private-sector companies strengthened to a 17-month high as the fourth quarter got underway. The European Commission's business and consumer survey showed economic sentiment also rose this month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  A revival in Germany drove that pickup, and the country's Ifo Institute survey of business sentiment improved in October. Deutsche Bank on Thursday said it expects Germany's economy to grow by 0.2% in the final three months of the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"For those looking at this from a glass-half-full perspective, the eurozone has remained far from recession despite all the global and domestic turmoil,\" ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But the half-empty take would be that evidence of sustained growth acceleration on the back of extra investment promises isn't there yet, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Germany's economy has borne the brunt of the higher tariffs, since it relies more heavily than other large eurozone economies on exports and manufacturing. The eurozone's largest economy narrowly avoided a slide into recession in the three months through September, extending a period of weak expansion that dates back to before the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But with the government now implementing a big increase in spending on defense and a repair of frayed infrastructure, there are hopes of a revival. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  German arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall have seen share prices soar amid promises over defense spending, and as the U.S. talks down its North Atlantic Treaty Organization commitments despite war continuing in Ukraine. Munich has become a growing military-tech hub, and factories that previously made cars are set to be repurposed as production lines for weapons. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The EU also earlier this year pledged to mobilize as much as 800 billion euros ($928.12 billion) as part of its own rearmament program up to the end of the decade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Yet the biggest driver of growth could be German investment in infrastructure--as much as 500 billion euros for creaking railways and green-energy transition programs--which is less subject to being redirected to military imports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  However, the eurozone's economy is unlikely to grow strongly without a rise in consumer spending, which has been subdued over recent years. Europeans continue to save more than before the pandemic, reflecting the uncertainty they have faced as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the U.S. subjected their industries to higher trade barriers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"In Europe, purchasing power has improved, the labor market is strong across multiple countries, inflation has come down, but household sentiment is still not great,\" said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist of BNP Paribas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  But as time passes and people realize they have more money in their pockets and in their bank accounts, and that they still have a job, spending should accelerate again, she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The European Central Bank, which left its key rate on hold for a third meeting in a row Thursday, expects its previous series of cuts in borrowing costs will help revive household spending and business investment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"I would not complain too much about growth at this point in time,\" its President Christine Lagarde said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The central bank is in a \"good place\", she said, repeating comments from the last few months. Investors are on the fence about whether the ECB will cut again in 2026 to support growth. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Ed Frankl at edward.frankl@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 30, 2025 12:06 ET (16:06 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
