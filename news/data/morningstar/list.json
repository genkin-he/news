At least, that was the view of two analysts who downgraded the stock in the wake of Wednesday's results and earnings call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's stock was sliding more than 11% in morning trading Thursday, with some analysts drawing parallels to past plans for a spending spree that weren't received well by Wall Street. The stock is heading for its worst one-day drop since it plunged about 25% on Oct. 27, 2022 - also in the wake of spending concerns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Significant investment in Superintelligence despite unknown revenue opportunity mirrors 2021/2022 metaverse spending,\" Oppenheimer analysts said, referring to Meta's recently formed Superintelligence Labs focused on AI that would surpass human knowledge. After Wall Street panned earlier metaverse-spending plans, Meta went through a \"year of efficiency\" focused on cost cuts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta is back to talking up big spending, and there's still \"uncertainty\" around the company's investments into AI, the Oppenheimer team said in a Wednesday note, while downgrading Meta's stock to perform from outperform. With Meta's after-hours stock drop, its price accurately reflected the company's new risk-reward balance, the analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The tech giant narrowed its expectations for capital expenditures to between $70 billion and $72 billion for this year, which would be well above the $39 billion that Meta spent last year. The company added that capex dollar growth will likely be \"noticeably larger\" next year, mostly due to continued spending on its AI-infrastructure build-out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Meta takes a $16 billion tax hit and earnings miss by wide margin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's implied capex and operating expenditures for the fourth quarter are both 7% higher than the Wall Street consensus, Oppenheimer said. And the company's expectations for expenses to grow \"significantly faster\" in 2026, along with its view for capex dollar growth, puts Meta's numbers ahead of those of Wall Street, the analysts added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In Oppenheimer's view, \"investors will struggle to rationalize\" Meta's price-to-earnings ratio \"until there is visibility into 2027, as aggressive revenue growth [has been] offset by high spending.\" The analysts contrasted Meta's situation with that of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), which they said had \"predictable earnings at a reasonable P/E.\" Meta and Alphabet shares are both trading at about 21 times 2027 earnings estimates, but Google's search business \"could outgrow Meta at some point\" next year, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Alphabet earnings are out. Here are the numbers driving the stock higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Benchmark analysts also downgraded Meta's stock on Thursday, moving to a hold rating from a buy rating. The analysts said that they expect Meta shares to be \"rangebound at best until a sensible return case can be made for thus far runaway capex.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite the dominance of Meta's advertising business, the company \"will need to justify returns\" beyond that segment, the analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Benchmark analysts said Meta's AI investments in other business areas, such as robotics and its Llama AI foundation models, \"are less certain against fresh, comparably capitalized competition,\" from companies such as OpenAI, Google and Tesla Inc. (TSLA), as well as frontier AI labs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's stock was also likely reacting to a one-time income-tax charge that drove a large gap between what the company delivered on profit and what analysts were expecting. With the charge, Meta reported earnings per share of $1.05, compared with the $6.72 consensus on FactSet. Without the charge, Meta said its EPS would have been $7.25. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Britney Nguyen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(NASDAQ: NTCT), a leading provider in observability, AIOps, cybersecurity, and DDoS attack protection solutions, today announced an innovation aimed at meeting organizations’ increasing needs for comprehensive observability within complex cloud environments. With the ever-growing demands of large, multi-cluster Kubernetes deployments, organizations often face significant challenges related to visibility and blind spots in their environments.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOmnis® KlearSight Sensor for Kubernetes (KlearSight) delivers deep, actionable, and real-time insights into system performance, health, and cost drivers. This solution is specifically designed to support dynamic and distributed architectures, environments that are challenging to monitor due to their encrypted nature. KlearSight captures Kubernetes packets and SSL messages directly from the Linux kernel’s networking stack after decryption has occurred. It then converts this data into standard IT traffic, enabling visibility into application-layer communications without requiring access to encryption keys. By providing robust visibility into these cloud environments, KlearSight empowers organizations to better manage and optimize their infrastructure, ensuring more reliable and efficient operations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Microservices running on a Kubernetes cluster generate multiple metrics, events, logs, and traces to provide some visibility across complex multi-cloud environments,” stated Jim Frey, principal analyst, Omdia. “However, searching through telemetry data streams to determine the root cause of an incident can be like searching for multiple needles across multiple haystacks. The ultimate source of truth lies in packets, and organizations can only benefit by establishing this level of visibility enterprise-wide, including the cloud and Kubernetes environments. Time and again, this has proven to be crucial for rapid recognition and diagnosis of performance incidents and issues while also enhancing AI-driven observability.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDeveloped from NETSCOUT’s expertise in network traffic analysis, deep packet inspection (DPI), and real-time traffic intelligence, KlearSight uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to extract packets from within the Linux kernel’s networking stack. It extends and enhances observability to understand system behavior and accelerate troubleshooting and incident response with unprecedented, low-overhead access to granular system and application data. The result is moving beyond monitoring <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">what</em> is happening in the environment towards understanding the <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">why</em> of any issue, including unusual patterns and anomalies, that often go unnoticed.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“NETSCOUT has been delivering innovative observability and visibility solutions that address end-through-end performance challenges for decades,” stated Phil Gray, AVP, product management, NETSCOUT. “Our solutions are mission-critical to large enterprises across all industries, especially as AI and cloud complexity continue to accelerate.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nNETSCOUT’s mission is to keep the connected world running by helping customers make smarter, better decisions – faster – to keep them resilient against disruptions of any kind.

Beyond digestion, gut health is the cornerstone of whole-body wellness. With so much misinformation and quick-fix health trends, many Canadians remain unsure how to select supplements that truly support their gut health. That’s why Genestra Brands, a leader in professional-grade probiotics, is launching its third annual PR campaign to continue its commitment to educating both consumers and the industry on common misconceptions and gaps in awareness.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This press release features multimedia.

Genestra’s science-backed gut health research links the microbiome to improve immunity, mood, skin, sleep, and energy, empowering Canadians to make informed decisions about their digestive wellness.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n\"What we’re learning from decades of research is that the microbiome is not a passive system, it’s actually constantly interacting with our physiology,” says Dr. Jacqueline van der Made, Naturopathic Doctor. “When the microbiome is disrupted, we may see ripple effects in areas as diverse as sleep, skin health, and mental well-being. By helping Canadians connect these dots, we can shift the conversation from ‘gut health is about digestion’ to ‘gut health is central to overall wellness.’”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Empowering Consumers Through Education</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGenestra aims to replace this uncertainty with science-backed, reliable education, helping both consumers and healthcare practitioners navigate the complex world of digestive wellness.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nOne important tip for maximizing the benefits of probiotics is to take them with food. On an empty stomach, the pH is highly acidic around 2.8 to 3.2 which can be harsh for probiotic organisms. Consuming probiotics alongside a meal helps neutralize stomach acid to the ideal pH of 3.8 to 4.5, creating an optimal environment for these beneficial bacteria to thrive and support digestive health.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Probiotics are the only living type of supplement, and because they are living, they’re in a sort of limbo suspended animation because we freeze dry them,” says Dr. Plummer. “When you take a probiotic and they reach your stomach and the intestinal tracts, these freeze dried organisms come into contact with water and start to activate again.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">HMF Probiotic Line</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nGenestra’s HMF Probiotics are designed to protect the microbiome and make gut health accessible at every stage of life.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'There are several team members with very long commutes' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Before people say snarky things like, 'Just suck it up and go into the office,' we were all hired as hybrid employees.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My question relates to paid time off and benefits. We have had a policy at work since the end of the pandemic that we are expected to be in the office four out of five days a week. Most people work from home on Fridays. The company has just enacted a new rule where, if you take a vacation day,  you are expected to come to the office the other four days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many people on my team feel this is punishment for taking time off. If you are taking paid time off, it should be your day to use as if it were an office day. Before people say snarky things like, \"Just suck it up and go into the office,\" we were all hired as hybrid employees, initially only working two days in the office with three days working from home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Last year, our employer made us sign new contracts with revised office hours, moving to the new four-day-in-office policy. Several team members have very long commutes, and this makes a big difference to them. There's talk of a mutiny. Do you think it's ethical for our management to use paid time off to get people back to the office? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disgruntled Employee </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500': I'm 78. Do I sell my tech stocks before it's too late? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Changing existing contracts can be tricky for both parties, especially under employment-at-will laws, where an employer may terminate your employment at any time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Disgruntled, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Pick your battles - and the timing of those battles. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yours is a legal question more than an ethical one. It all depends on the nature of your existing contracts, what is (or is not) specified, and employment law in your state. There is no straightforward answer. From a human-resources perspective, it makes little sense to effectively conflate vacation days with work-from-home days, and it also seems to run counter to promoting goodwill. Paid time off is part of your contract and should be treated as such. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A happy employee is a productive employee. A disgruntled employee will be more likely to sow discontent. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nickel-and-diming employees' remote-working days makes less sense for your management from a productivity point of view. A happy employee is a productive employee. An unhappy and disgruntled employee will be more likely to complain, grumble, debate, gossip and sow discontent among other employees. An unhappy employee is more likely to engage in contrarian or insubordinate behavior and will generally create a nuisance. It can bring down the entire team and affect company morale. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Changing existing contracts can be tricky for both parties, especially under employment-at-will laws, where a company may terminate your employment at any time, for any reason and without any legal ramifications. In the U.S., 49 out of 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, follow employment-at-will laws by default - with the exception being Montana, where employers need \"good cause\" to terminate an employee after their probationary period has ended. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I feel slighted': My late husband's parents left me nothing in their will. Is that thoughtless? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An uncertain time </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. labor market is going through an uncertain time. Before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. unemployment rate had risen to 4.3% in August from 4.2% the prior month. On Monday, the Chicago Federal Reserve, using a mixture of private-sector data including job boards, polls and data from payroll firms, estimated that the unemployment rate has held steady in October at around 4.3%. Still, that's only an estimate of what's happening out there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The government has not released its September jobs report due to the prolonged government shutdown, but most economists estimate that new unemployment filings reached roughly 220,000 in mid-October, leaving them effectively unchanged since the shutdown began. On Tuesday, payroll firm ADP said private-sector employers added an average of 14,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Oct. 11. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, said the lack of data adds to the uncertainty surrounding the labor market. Writing on X earlier this month, he said, \"There is no more important economic data, particularly now, when the job market is sputtering and the Federal Reserve is a few weeks from another meeting when it must decide whether to continue cutting interest rates.\" He added that \"not having the BLS jobs data is a serious problem for assessing the health of the economy and making good policy decisions.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Legal complexities </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Vigilante Law Firm, which has offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, says if your employer creates a new employment agreement that changes the roles and responsibilities that fall under your given job title, there could be legal consequences. \"They must receive your explicit, willing consent to these changes, otherwise this legally-binding contract may be deemed invalid and ineffective,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Your New Jersey-based employer is allowed to bring forward a new employment agreement even after you have already started working for them,\" the law firm says. \"However, it is illegal for them to 'force' you to sign this agreement through duress or undue influence. So, your employer cannot change the terms of your employment without informing you first; this may be considered a unilateral change that results in a breach of contract.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you win, it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But if you win, it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. \"While you have the right to refuse your signature, your employer equally has the right to fire you over your unwillingness to comply with their new terms and conditions,\" the law firm adds. \"Further, if you get fired over a refusal to sign, you may even become disqualified from receiving the government's unemployment benefits program, among other consequences.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Civil Rights Act sets out several protected classes: race; color; religion; sex, including pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity; and national origin. Other laws protect workers against discrimination based on age (for employees who are 40 or older); disability, and genetic information, including family medical history, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Political speech or political affiliation is not protected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: My husband and I have $7K in Social Security and $2.5 million in stocks. What could go wrong? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Magnitude of the changes </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Geonetta &amp; Frucht, a law firm based in Oakland, Calif., says employees may have more leverage than they think when they're presented with a new contract, even though they're still working under an existing contract. \"Contract modifications require both your consent and that of your employer,\" it says. \"Therefore, any changes made without you agreeing to them are null and void.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The law firm adds: \"Depending on the magnitude of changes made, the court might nullify the employment contract entirely. An employer that amends a contract without your consent has no right to enforce the amended contract terms. In some instances, you can take the employer to court for breach of the original contract and recover damages. Serious legal consequences await any party that changes the terms without the other party's consent.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sometimes it's easier to change your place of employment than to change the company itself. In this job market, however, there are no guarantees. Don't leap before you have your next role signed, sealed and delivered. Every company has its own culture, priorities and rules, and those can change as management changes. Before you stage a mutiny, think about the damage you could inflict upon yourself. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'They will drown you too': My coworker found out I inherited money - and harassed me to give him a loan </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com, and follow Quentin Fottrell on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I'll retire when I'm dead': My 401(k) lost $50,000 in the market turmoil.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Alessandra Malito </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Major Social Security reform could change the way the program serves young Americans in the future. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They entered the job market during the Great Recession and began to make strides in their careers as a global pandemic hit, so perhaps it's no surprise that millennials may wind up historically unlucky when it comes to Social Security. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, their wages are helping to support the retirement of one of the largest generations in history, the baby boomers, who are hoovering up benefits amid concerns about the future of the Social Security program's finances. But if demographic trends continue as expected, there won't be enough workers to finance the retirement security of millennials, who are also part of an unusually large generation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In some ways, the millennials are on both sides of it,\" said Gopi Shah Goda, director of the Retirement Security Project at the Brookings Institution. \"They're paying into the program at a moment where baby boomers are retiring and collecting benefits - but with the next generation or two generations, there might be fewer of them to pay their benefits.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Already, the Social Security program is running out of money. Trustees warn the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund, which pays out retiree and survivor benefits, could become insolvent as early as 2033 - in which case recipients across the board would receive about 77% of the benefits they were expecting. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given that baby boomers are an unusually large generation, some younger Americans have wondered if they'll \"break Social Security,\" while others have questioned if the boomer generation dying off will make the program easier to fund. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But unfortunately for millennials and the generations that follow, that isn't how it works. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This is bigger than just the baby boomers retiring,\" Brookings's Goda said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Part of the problem lies in how many workers there are compared to beneficiaries, known as the worker-to-beneficiary ratio. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are two sides to the ratio: the workers who pay into the system, and the beneficiaries who receive benefits from it. As baby boomers move away from the workforce and into retirement, the number of beneficiaries increases. But there is also a decline in fertility rates, producing fewer workers who pay into the system. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: The man who fixed Social Security when it went broke in the '80s has some advice for today's politicians </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There were just 2.7 workers per beneficiary in 2023, according to a recent Pew Research Center report, and that ratio is expected to decline to 2.1 by the end of the century. Comparatively, the ratio was 3.2 in 1975, according to the Social Security Administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The SSA's trust fund for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, which is expected to be depleted first, is already paying out more than it is bringing in; in 2024, its costs exceeded its income by $103.2 billion, according to the trustees report. The Disability Insurance trust fund - which pays monthly benefits to eligible disabled workers and their spouses and children - is expected to stay solvent until at least 2099, bringing the difference between the program's total costs and income to $67 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shifts in U.S. demographics </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Actuaries account for fertility and longevity rates when they make their estimates about Social Security's solvency, experts noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The underlying demographic patterns that have led to the aging of the U.S. population have long been reflected in Social Security's financial projections, consistently showing financial challenges that extend well into the future,\" Sam Gutterman, chair of the American Academy of Actuaries' Social Security Committee, said in a statement. \"If Congress does not act in a timely manner, [Social Security's] financial shortfall will endure long after the baby boomers stop receiving benefits.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition to declining birth rates among the native-born U.S. population, the impact of changing immigration policy is also complicating Social Security's future, experts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There has been controversy and confusion around Social Security and immigration, but unauthorized immigrants - who may pay into the system through payroll taxes - do not receive benefits. Only \"lawfully present noncitizens of the United States who meet all eligibility requirements can qualify for Social Security benefits,\" according to the SSA, while immigrants without this legal status do not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A decline in immigration into the U.S. would hurt the program's finances, according to experts. Immigrants, even those who aren't in the U.S. legally, can contribute to Social Security in two ways: financially, through payroll taxes, and demographically, by having children who will later become workers that pay into the system. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"With a lower fertility rate, we have fewer workers contributing to the system, driving down the worker-to-beneficiary ratio,\" said Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The problem is \"compounded by immigration rates plummeting,\" she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The country's foreign-born population decreased by more than 1 million people between January and June 2025, the first such decline since the 1960s, according to the Pew Research Center, while 19% of the country's labor force were immigrants, down from 20% in January. Recent immigration-policy changes, including during the Biden and Trump administrations, have led to the decline, Pew reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Women are having fewer babies and the U.S. is welcoming dramatically less immigrants,\" Romig said. \"It affects things longer term.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Where Social Security reform fits in </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Given all of these demographic shifts, changes to the system are inevitable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I don't view these things as a crisis,\" said Eric Kingson, professor emeritus at Syracuse University's School of Social Work. \"We are always going to have to make changes in complex and important systems like this. This is the nation's most popular and successful program.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans want to see change within the Social Security program, even if it costs them. Across generational, political and economic lines, individuals agree the program is worth saving, according to a National Academy of Social Insurance survey of more than 2,000 Americans. As part of the survey, the organization asked about a package of provisions that would boost the program's finances - such as by increasing the payroll-tax rate, or removing the income cap for how much workers must earn before they no longer have to pay into the system for the rest of the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Legislators have yet to decide on what to do about Social Security reform. In a Fox Business interview, SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano said that the White House, Congress and the Social Security trustees would come together to find a solution. \"And that's where the real work will happen. And that'll take a while, but we have plenty of time,\" he said on \"Mornings with Maria.\" Bisignano later took to the social-media website X to clarify that he is \"committed to protecting and preserving Social Security.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Social Security's commissioner says younger generations may have a different set of rules. Should Gen Z even plan for it? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With depletion closing in, legislators have yet to decide on how to fix the program. Along with raising the income cap on workers who pay into the system or increasing the payroll tax, possible reform includes upping the full retirement age, which is when claimants are eligible for 100% of the benefit they're owed. The full retirement age currently is 67 for anyone born in and after 1960, and there have been suggestions publicly discussed to raise it for current younger workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other, more nuanced options that could also affect solvency. The American Academy of Actuaries has an interactive game called the Social Security Challenge, which allows users to see how various adjustments to the program would affect its financing status. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Millennials and younger generations are the ones most likely to be affected by any legislative alterations to the program, as it often takes years to implement changes even after they've become law. The 1983 amendments to Social Security included increasing the full retirement age from 65 to 67 - but that only took effect in 2000. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"What people don't fully realize is that current workers have as much or a bigger stake in how the program is reformed going forward than current retirees, because they're the ones who are paying the bills,\" Brookings's Goda said. \"What the future of the program looks like has the biggest implication for current workers and less so for current retirees.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Alessandra Malito </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

And so far this year, Hershey said its chocolate retail sales have returned to growth, they have increased 4% after a previous 1% decline in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the stock dropped 3.8% in morning trading, toward the lowest prices seen since mid-July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     During the third quarter, Reese's Oreo was the \"top new item\" in the candy, mint and gum category, the company said, with retail-sales trends exceeding targets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Reese's Oreo </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Early data shows that Reese's Oreo overindexes with Gen Z and millennial buyers, a priority audience for the brand,\" Tanner said. The company is preparing fresh advertising and partnerships to raise the confectionery's profile on Instagram, TikTok and through live events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Overall, net sales for the third quarter increased 6.5% from a year ago to $3.18 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus revenue estimate of $3.12 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Hershey has managed to boost prices, and as tariff costs have declined, the extra revenue \"only partially mitigates\" inflation from higher cocoa costs, which are still about 70% above levels in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hershey said it expects cocoa prices to come down over time, with a larger global supply surplus expected for the 2025 and 2026 crop thanthe prior season. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Third-quarter net income fell to $276.3 million from $446.3 million in the year-ago quarter, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 handily beat the FactSet consensus EPS estimate of $1.07. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company raised its outlook for 2025 EPS to between $5.90 and $6 from a range of $5.81 to $6. That compares with the analyst EPS projection of $6.02 a share, and with the year-ago level of $9.37 a share. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff in Hershey's stock has turned it negative for the year. It has now slipped 0.4% in 2025, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has advanced 16.4%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Steve Gelsi </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
