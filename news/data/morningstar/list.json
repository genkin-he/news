Under Gillum's theory, the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, is linked at least in part to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity.

Meanwhile, the yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y fell below 4.7% to the lowest 3 p.m. Eastern time level of the past three months.

While economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place.

The restructuring will bring Block's (XYZ) employee count below 6,000 versus more than 10,000 today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The layoffs at Block come just days after Citrini Research rattled markets with the publication of a blog post detailing a fictional scenario in which AI productivity tools were so powerful that they forced widespread shifts in the U.S. labor market.

Gross profit, which is seen by Wall Street as a reasonably clean barometer for Block's top-line performance, was up 24% from a year before to $2.87 billion. Analysts were looking for $2.74 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Block now expects 18% growth in gross profit for the full year, above the 17% target it set at an investor day late last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That new outlook reflects a \"recognition of our ability to continue to drive against our roadmap\" with a \"smaller, more nimble, flatter organizational structure,\" Ahuja said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
