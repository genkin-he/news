My in-laws always seemed caring and loving to me. My husband passed away and we continued to have a close relationship, saying that I was a daughter to them, etc. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I never remarried. About 15 years later, my in-laws passed away. They left their inheritance to only their two biological children and nothing to me. I feel slighted and hurt. Do you think that's a valid feeling? Or is it normal to not leave anything to a daughter-in-law? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Daughter-in-law </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's a mistake to equate love with money. They are separate concepts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Daughter-in-law, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your feelings are valid. But feelings are not facts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The trick is to process them, ask ourselves why we feel this way, wonder whether we could see this from a different point of view, and how that changes how we feel about the situation. Would you leave a third of your estate to a son-in-law or daughter-in-law in a similar situation? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Parents who lose a child sometimes leave that child's share of their estate to the deceased child's children. Your in-laws did not do that. Maybe it didn't occur to them - or they simply neglected to update their will. But that is not an invitation for you to request a share. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Does not mentioning you in their will mean they did not hold you in high regard? Does that mean they did not think of you as their daughter after all? Does being excluded from their will mean you are not part of the family? I'm not convinced the answer to any of those questions is \"yes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's a mistake to equate love with money. The latter involves obligations that go beyond the relationship between in-laws and their daughter-in-law. Thank God for that. You had a relationship free of the leverage and entitlement that sometimes comes with being a parent. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Money can have a corrosive effect on relationships - romantic, platonic and familial - and upsets the balance of power in a relationship. When one party expects something from the other party, it can lead to resentment and a desire, however unintentional, to act in a superficial way. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': Who exactly is considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Two choices await </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Who would argue with a multimillionaire parent and/or tell them what's really on your mind if you knew that you were in line to inherit a small fortune? How would that impact the natural flow? Would it create a less honest and equal relationship? Maybe. Probably. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You have two choices now: You can hold onto this hurt, which could turn to righteous indignation if left to fester, or you could acknowledge that nobody owes you anything, and you don't owe anyone else anything. And that's the best part of this entire process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Everyone will have an opinion on your letter, but they will be rooted in their own familial relationships. But try to come to a place where you can respect your in-laws' decision - and not allow it to spoil your memories of them and the affection you shared for each other. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You took care of your husband for 10 years. That wasn't an easy job and it probably didn't come with appreciation 100% of the time from others. But you weren't doing it so you could be raised in the esteem of your next-door neighbor or in-laws; you did it because you felt it was the right thing to do. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Chances are that there was nowhere else you would rather be during those 10 years than at your husband's side, showing him that you loved him and proving that love is not a word, but an action. You wanted to make his final years less difficult and less lonely. And so you stood by him. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sandcastles in the sky </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Moneyist Facebook Group had various takes on your question. One woman wisely wrote: \"Normal is a setting on a washer. It is not at all unusual not to leave anything to an in-law nor. If other in-laws left something specifically then you might have a reason to feel slighted.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another commenter identified with your story: \"Same thing happened to me. I was married for over 25 years and my husband passed away unexpectedly. ?My in-laws changed their will, and instead of my kids inheriting 50%, they were each left 10% on a few accounts.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     She blamed her sister-in-law more than her in-laws. \"I'm more upset with her that she didn't do the right thing and make sure that her brother's children received his share. When my mother died, my sister and I made sure that everything was split 50-50 down the middle.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In your case, the expectation that you would receive your late husband's share of their estate is, at best, unrealistic, and, at worst, unrealistic. The thought entered your head and, perhaps, you could not resist thinking about what you might do with one-third of their estate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Estate planning, as a rule, should involve real 401(k)s and IRAs, money-market accounts, trusts, wills, healthcare directives, emergency funds and power-of-attorney documents. With dreams of this inheritance, you were building sandcastles in the sky, a future without any foundation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My parents promised to split their estate 50/50, but my mother gave my brother real estate.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Christine Idzelis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Powell sent this 'clear message' to markets, according to Guggenheim's Matt Bush </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed cut rates but bond investors pushed yields higher, which means relief for many borrowers will need to wait. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has triggered a backup in Treasury yields, causing bonds to stumble after he pointed to \"strongly differing views\" at the Fed about its next step on rates in December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was rising Thursday to around 4.09%, after on Wednesday posting its biggest jump since July, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That was despite the Fed having just lowered its policy rate by a quarter-percentage point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The rise in Treasury yields is really the response to the generally hawkish message that I think Powell very intentionally portrayed,\" at his news conference Wednesday afternoon that another rate cut as soon as December was \"far\" from a \"foregone conclusion,\" said Matt Bush, U.S. economist at Guggenheim Investments, in a phone interview. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's \"particularly notable,\" as it was part of Powell's opening remarks as opposed to an \"off-the-cuff\" comment made during the news conference, said Bush, sending \"a clear message\" to the market, which had been pricing in a December cut as a \"virtual lock.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At issue is the tension between the Fed's dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, with Powell pointing to the challenging situation presented by upside risks to inflation and downside risks to the labor market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That leaves the Fed internally debating whether to greenlight a faster pace of rate cuts amid worries over a softening labor market, versus waiting for more economic data given lingering concerns over inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The debate and market response matter because the yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note influences borrowing costs in the U.S., including the rate Americans may pay for mortgages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors also are eyeing the cost of debt financing for the U.S. government, given concern about its large deficit and appetite for long-term Treasurys. That means the Treasury Department's next quarterly refunding statement will be closely watched for the duration of Treasurys that it plans to issue to meet its expected borrowing needs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     TD Securities strategists indicated in an emailed note Thursday that they expect to see the refunding announcement by next week.  The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on its upcoming quarterly refunding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While concerns over a split view inside the Fed about the path of future rate cuts rattled the bond market on Wednesday, Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told MarketWatch that he's looking through the \"dissections\" of Powell's press conference at \"the pretty clear trend here in place for lower rates.\" The precise timing and number of expected rate cuts doesn't matter as much to him. \"We're just going to focus on the direction, which we think is still lower,\" said Christopher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If the market is going to flitter around that, that might be a buying opportunity,\" as the Fed is loosening monetary policy at a time when the economy seems \"pretty solid,\" said Christopher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bonds sold off Wednesday as Treasury rates climbed. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF BND, a popular exchange-traded fund that provides broad exposure to investment-grade fixed-income assets in the U.S., fell 0.5%, according to FactSet data. Long-term Treasurys were particularly hard hit Wednesday, with the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury ETF VGLT dropping 0.9% and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT losing 1%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although the yield on the 10-year Treasury note continued to rise on Thursday afternoon, it remains down so far this month and this year, according to FactSet data. The 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y also was edging up, to around 3.61%, but remained down year to date as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We believe there is an increased chance that December's [Fed] meeting may [result in a skipped rate] cut, which would push off further accommodative rate moves into the new year, and potentially to a new chair,\" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income and head of the firm's global allocation investment team, in emailed comments Wednesday. Rieder is among the candidates under consideration to replace Powell as Fed chair next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed funds futures on Thursday pointed to a potential rate cut in December, even if traders dialed back the probability after Powell's press conference, to about 73%, the CME FedWatch Tool showed, at last check. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed decided Wednesday to lower its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 3.75% to 4%, as Wall Street expected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now we're 150 basis points closer to neutral, wherever that may be, than we were a year ago,\" Powell remarked during his news conference Wednesday. \"And so there's a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle, something like that,\" he said, referring to discussions by the Federal Open Market Committee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The \"split\" views from the FOMC on whether to more aggressively ease monetary policy seems to be coming into \"clearer focus,\" said Michael Rosen, CIO at Angeles Investments, by phone. The market has tended to be \"way too aggressive in anticipating rapid easing by the Fed,\" he said. \"Inflation has been stuck at 3%,\" remaining above the Fed's 2% target. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rosen worries that aggressive rate cuts would risk exacerbating inflation. And while lowering rates may help make borrowing cheaper, exacerbating inflation \"hurts poor people more than it hurts wealthier people,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation,\" Powell said during his news conference.  \"A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived - a one-time shift in the price level.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the Fed is also assessing the possibility of \"inflationary effects\" becoming more persistent, Powell cautioned. \"Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Christine Idzelis </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

In addition, VA loans limit closings costs and are assumable to other qualified buyers at the same rate. Should borrowers begin struggling with monthly payments, the VA also has programs in place to help them avoid foreclosure.

Melodia also features an open space area, the perfect spot for a game of catch or walking the dog.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSales opportunities at Melodia continue, with prices starting in the mid $600,000s and onsite tours are available.

Increases in Malaysian palm oil and most MATIF rapeseed contracts further underpinned canola. Crude oil was relatively steady, providing almost no direction to the vegetable oils. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday during the APEC summit in South Korea.
