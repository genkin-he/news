            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Company's cash hoard at end of 2025 - which Abel noted was not a sign of an investment retreat - was down 2.1% from September to $373.3 billion </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Berkshire Hathaway's cash holdings have dipped, and the new CEO, Greg Abel, is evaluating opportunities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's Greg Abel's Berkshire Hathaway now, but the last act of Warren Buffett as CEO appears to have been putting some of the conglomerate's record cash hoard to work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And in the first annual shareholder letter not penned by Buffett in 60 years, Abel said he is currently evaluating other opportunities, but will remain patient and disciplined in making investments, even in Berkshire's own stock (BRK.B) (BRK.A). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel assured shareholders that the way decisions are made, and how capital is allocated under his watch, will continue on the path set by Buffett \"into perpetuity.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Berkshire's annual report released early Saturday showed that the cash held as of Dec. 31 was $373.31 billion, down from the record $381.67 billion held at the end of the third quarter but still up 11.7% from the end of 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Many times in Berkshire's history, some observers have suggested that our substantial cash position signals a retreat from investing,\" Abel wrote. \"It does not.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And while Abel said share repurchases were an \"important capital-allocation option,\" the company didn't buy back any stock during the fourth quarter, extending that trend to six quarters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Berkshire's stock was little-changed during the fourth quarter, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX rose 2.4%. So far this year, the stock has edged up 0.5% to match the S&amp;P 500's performance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following are some key insights from Abel's letter to shareholders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investments in Japan are as important as U.S. holdings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel noted that a large portion of Berkshire's equity investments are held in a small number of U.S. companies, notably investments in Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and Moody's (MCO). The total market value of those holdings was $158.6 billion as of Dec. 31. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long-term economic prospects,\" Abel wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The same methodology in choosing investments in American companies is used in finding opportunities in Japan, \"which we view as comparable to our major U.S. holdings in importance and long-term value-creation opportunity.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The largest Japan holdings, with a total market value of $35.37 billion, are Mitsubishi (JP: 8058), Itochu (JP: 8001), Mitsui &amp; Co. (MITSY), Marubeni (MARUY) and Sumitomo (SSUMY). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earnings fall for the quarter and year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Net income in the latest quarter fell 2.5% from the same period a year ago to $19.2 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Operating earnings, which exclude investment gains and other nonrecurring items, declined 29.8% to $10.2 billion for the quarter, and were down 6.2% for the year to $44.5 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel noted, however, that while 2025 earnings showed a decline, they were above the $37.5 billion in earnings Berkshire has averaged over the past five years, which he said underscores the durability of Berkshire's operating business, while also showing there's room for improvement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buffett remains a fixture at the office </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's how Abel's first shareholder letter started: \"Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He said, however, that Buffett shouldn't be viewed solely as an investment guru. What will endure, according to his successor as CEO, is how he ran his businesses, and how he treated shareholders as partners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Buffett may no longer be running the business, but Abel reminded shareholders that Buffett will still be in the office \"five days a week\" as chairman, and will continue to have a say in which stocks Berkshire buys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Uncontrolled proliferation and activation of mast cells result in chronic, severe and often unpredictable symptoms across multiple organ systems. The vast majority of those affected have indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). Despite treatment with multiple symptom-directed therapies, patients with ISM frequently experience persistent symptoms including anaphylaxis, maculopapular rash, pruritus, diarrhea, brain fog, fatigue and bone pain, as well as long-term health complications such as osteoporosis. This burden of disease can lead to a profound, negative impact on quality of life. Patients often live in fear of severe, unexpected symptoms, have limited ability to work or perform daily activities, and isolate themselves to protect against unpredictable triggers. There were no approved therapies for ISM until 2023, when AYVAKIT received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this indication.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A minority of patients have advanced SM, which encompasses a group of high-risk SM subtypes including aggressive SM (ASM), SM with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL). In addition to mast cell activation symptoms, advanced SM is associated with organ damage due to mast cell infiltration – including bone lesions, malabsorption, liver dysfunction and bone marrow failure – as well as poor overall survival.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Blueprint Medicines' Clinical Studies in SM</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Blueprint Medicines has pursued a broad development program for patients living with SM, including three registrational clinical studies for AYVAKIT and one for elenestinib. PIONEER is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AYVAKIT in patients with ISM, and PATHFINDER and EXPLORER are open-label, single-arm clinical studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AYVAKIT in patients with advanced SM.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The HARBOR clinical study (NCT04910685) of elenestinib, an investigational next-generation KIT D816V inhibitor, is currently enrolling patients with ISM. HARBOR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study that includes dose-finding Part 1, registrational Part 2 and long-term treatment Part 3.

It was FDA approved for the treatment of advanced SM in June 2021 and ISM in May 2023. It now is indicated in adults with ISM, adults with advanced SM, including ASM, SM-AHN and MCL, and adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. The medicine is approved in the EU as AYVAKYT<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">®</span> for the treatment of adults with ISM with moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment, adults with ASM, SM-AHN or MCL, after at least one systemic therapy, and adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The therapy is not recommended for the treatment of patients with low platelet counts (less than 50,000/µL). Globally, the medicine is approved for one or more indications in more than 35 countries worldwide, including China where it has been developed and commercialized by CStone Pharmaceuticals, which pays tiered percentage royalties on sales.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Please click here to see the full <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629544-1&amp;h=2128645761&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blueprintmedicines.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fuspi%2FAYVAKIT.pdf&amp;a=U.S.%C2%A0Prescribing+Information\" tabindex=\"0\">U.S. Prescribing Information</a> for AYVAKIT, and click here to see the <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629544-1&amp;h=1049365237&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ema.europa.eu%2Fen%2Fdocuments%2Fproduct-information%2Fayvakyt-epar-product-information_en.pdf&amp;a=European+Summary+of+Product+Characteristics\" tabindex=\"0\">European Summary of Product Characteristics</a> for AYVAKYT.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Important Safety Information</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Cognitive Effects — Cognitive adverse reactions can occur in patients receiving AYVAKIT and occurred in 7.8% of patients with ISM who received AYVAKIT + best supportive care (BSC) versus 7.0% of patients who received placebo + BSC; &lt;1% were Grade 3.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Smart Digital was the subject of a market manipulation and fraudulent promotion scheme involving social-media based misinformation and impersonators posing as financial professionals; (2) insiders and/or affiliates used and/or intended to use offshore or nominee accounts to facilitate the coordinated dumping of shares during a price inflation campaign; (3) Smart Digital's public statements and risk disclosures omitted any mention of realized risk of fraudulent trading or market manipulation used to drive Smart Digital's stock price; (4) as a result, Smart Digital securities were at unique risk of a sustained suspension in trading by either or both of the SEC and NASDAQ; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Smart Digital's business, operations and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the SDM class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629730-1&amp;h=2535422655&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50638&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50638\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50638</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.

He added that the Department of Defense and other U.S. agencies have six months to phase out Anthropic's technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The conflict stems from Anthropic's contract with the Defense Department, which is worth up to $200 million. Anthropic has drawn a line in the sand over how the department can use its technology. Specifically, Anthropic doesn't want its products to be used to develop autonomous weapons or for mass surveillance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Pentagon has said it has \"no interest\" in using AI for those purposes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But something curious happened after Trump's announcement about Anthropic: OpenAI said that it had struck a government deal and that it was able to secure carve-outs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on the X platform. The Defense Department \"agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement,\" he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a blog post that his company \"tried in good faith to reach an agreement with the Department of War,\" using the name the Trump administration prefers for the Pentagon, \"making clear that we support all lawful uses of AI for national security aside from the two narrow exceptions.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The company does \"not believe that today's frontier AI models are reliable enough to be used in fully autonomous weapons,\" he added. And, he said, the team at Anthropic believes \"that mass domestic surveillance of Americans constitutes a violation of fundamental rights.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump's announcement came after days of public and private back-and-forth negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic that occasionally turned ugly. After Amodei defended his company's refusal to budge on Thursday, a Pentagon official accused him of trying to \"personally control the U.S. military.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, wrote on X. Michael, a former executive at Uber Technologies (UBER), also accused Anthropic of having a plan to \"impose\" its values on Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A Jan. 9 memo handed down by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called for AI labs to amend their defense contracts to allow \"any lawful use\" of their technology. Hegseth gave the department 180 days to insert that standard into any contract that involves procuring AI services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"DoD does not want a private company's usage policy to function as a veto over lawful military applications,\" Jessica Tillipman, a professor at George Washington University's law school who specializes in government procurement law, told MarketWatch over email. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If DoD makes this the default clause across all AI vendors, it eliminates vendor-by-vendor negotiation over acceptable use and signals that firms unwilling to accept that baseline will be replaced,\" Tillipman said. \"It sounds like boring contract boilerplate, but it is really about procurement leverage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following Trump's announcement, Hegseth formally declared Anthropic a supply-chain risk to national security, a designation previously applied only to foreign companies, notably those based in China and believed to be under government influence. As a result of Hegseth's action, no contractor, supplier or partner that does business with the U.S. military can conduct \"any commercial activity\" with Anthropic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That has potentially major implications for Anthropic, which recently raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation and disclosed $14 billion in annual run-rate revenue, driven mostly by increasing enterprise adoption of its products. More than 500 business customers now spend over $1 million annually on Anthropic's products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), which alongside Nvidia (NVDA) signed a strategic partnership with Anthropic last November, works with the Defense Department.  Amazon (AMZN), which has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic, recently detailed a plan to support the Pentagon through access to Amazon Web Services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before this week, Claude was the only AI model approved for classified use in the Pentagon. Claude was even used, through a Palantir Technologies (PLTR) partnership, to help the U.S. capture Venezuela's then-president, Nicolás Maduro, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Elon Musk's xAI signed a deal to allow its controversial Grok model to be used for classified purposes earlier this week. Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns over potential safety issues with Grok, the Journal reports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Amazon, Nvidia and SoftBank pour $110 billion into OpenAI - raising the stakes for AI monetization </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Emily Bary contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Greg Robb </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. and Israel strike several locations in Iran, which responds with missile attacks on Gulf nations </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump greeted members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as he arrived to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     War with Iran is expected to lead to a spike in oil prices, which, if prolonged, could mean the next move by the Federal Reserve is to raise interest rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump has called for regime change in Iran. Experts said one of the largest-scale concerns is that this Iranian regime will see its very existence at stake. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Iranian regime \"is going to do whatever they can and whatever they believe will help them stay in power,\" said Suzanne Maloney, director of the foreign-policy program at the Brookings Institution, speaking at a Chicago Council on Global Affairs event this week. \"That does include striking both their neighbors, against energy infrastructure in the region, and, of course, against Israel and the U.S. military and any other presence in the region. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It could be a very dangerous time in the aftermath of American military action in Iran.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the U.S. economy, meanwhile, it seems certain that war will push the inflation rate higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The argument for having lower rates is just evaporating right before our very eyes,\" said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, in an interview with MarketWatch. The uptick in oil prices combined with the Trump administration's aggressive approach to tariffs will keep prices high. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: After the U.S. and Israel attack Iran, bitcoin and oil are offering glimpses into the broader response of markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the past several months, the Fed has struggled to tamp down inflation amid pressure from the White House and the markets to cut rates. These latest developments in the Middle East only add to the central bank's challenges. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prices at the wholesale level started to accelerate in December and are now running at a 3% annual rate, frustrating Federal Reserve officials who had hoped that Trump's new levies on imports would have only a transitory impact on inflation. It's likely that the increase in producer prices will soon be passed on to consumers, said Ethan Harris, former chief economist at BofA Securities, in a note on LinkedIn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inflation is looking like it's heating up in the first quarter, agreed Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Experts said one of the largest-scale concerns is that this Iranian regime will see its very existence at stake. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Iranian regime \"is going to do whatever they can and whatever they believe will help them stay in power,\" said Suzanne Maloney, director of the foreign-policy program at the Brookings Institution, speaking at a Chicago Council on Global Affairs event this week. \"That does include striking both their neighbors, against energy infrastructure in the region, and, of course, against Israel and the U.S. military and any other presence in the region. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It could be a very dangerous time in the aftermath of American military action in Iran.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the U.S. economy, meanwhile, it seems certain that war will push the inflation rate higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The argument for having lower rates is just evaporating right before our very eyes,\" said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, in an interview with MarketWatch.

To achieve a strong and stable start, China's economy relies on its powerful domestic growth drivers, as well as its unique systematic advantages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In today's world, the scarcest resource is the market. China, with its 1.4 billion people and the world's most complete industrial system, is steadily reinforcing its unified national market, catalyzing the country's economic development. In the Yangtze River Delta, a new energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturer can quickly secure all necessary components — from battery materials in Ningde to smart screens in Shanghai — within just four hours. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, manufacturing materials can also be swiftly reallocated and dispatched via land ports, despite administrative boundaries. Across China, authorities are accelerating efforts to break down administrative barriers and facilitate the free flow of economic resources, enabling optimal resource allocation for more industries nationwide. The organic integration of the unified national market is a vivid embodiment of China's economic resilience and strength.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The consumption engine continues to gather momentum, injecting renewed vitality that supports the long-term strength of the Chinese economy. China is home to the world's largest middle-income group and an enormous domestic consumer market with immense potential. In the past year, domestic demand contributed over 67% of China's GDP growth. Buoyed by the consumer goods trade-in program, retail turnover for home appliances and communication devices have both surpassed the one trillion yuan mark. Trendy toy IPs continue to gain traction, micro-dramas have risen rapidly, and a single performance can make an entire city go viral. Such new types of service-oriented consumption centered on new scenarios, business formats and operating models are emerging as potential fresh growth drivers for China's consumption market. As consumption upgrading gathers pace, it is also steadily shouldering the main responsibility for driving China's economic growth.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">More targeted investment is delivering greater efficiency. As one of the three drivers of economic growth, investment in China has shifted from a broad \"flood-style\" approach to targeted measures that aim to bolster weak links. For example, new infrastructure projects like the national computing power hubs have been rolled out and generated tangible results; livelihood-focused investments such as the renovation of old residential communities and the construction of social-security housing have brought warmth to many; investments in manufacturing technological upgrading have consistently improved productivity among traditional industries. By directing investment towards the real economy, improvements to well-being and industry upgrading, China is not only stimulating economic growth in the present, but also building momentum for the long term, ensuring that every yuan invested delivers maximum impact.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The momentum of technological innovation is picking up pace, becoming a new engine that spurs development. China's core AI industry has exceeded 1 trillion yuan, with \"AI+\" business formats mushrooming in industrial and commercial sectors. China's NEV production and sales have ranked first globally for 11 consecutive years; cutting-edge technologies like gene editing and cell therapy have provided new solutions for treating complex diseases. The new system for mobilizing resources nationwide has helped break through key technological bottlenecks, and fruits of technological innovation are rapidly moving from the lab onto production lines, fueling economic development with a steady surge of new momentum.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">From the scale advantage of a unified national market to the domestic vitality of consumption, and from the effective boost of targeted investments to the core drive of technological innovation, the intrinsic forces propelling China's economy are going from strength to strength, with the country's systematic advantages becoming ever more pronounced. These forces empower one another, creating a powerful synergy that makes a solid start to the 15th Five-Year Plan not only a clear target, but also an inevitable outcome.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Well-grounded Confidence!

Physically, he is not able to live independently, but was or is pretty sharp mentally. We take care of all his bills; his house and car were sold over three years ago. His wife died in 2020; they had no children. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over the last 10 days, he started calling my sister about bills he needed to pay; all his bills are being paid by her. He also wants to know the balance in his bank accounts. My sister has always given him this information when he asks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He wanted to see the lawyer recently. He was very paranoid, asking staff to witness their conversation. He doesn't remember that he sold his house or car. In an email, his lawyer said, \"He's gone off the deep end.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The lawyer's last words to us were we might have to appoint a new executor if his condition continues to deteriorate. My sister and I are his only family, the will is made and we would inherit his estate. What do we do next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Other Sibling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

It lacks compassion, professionalism and respect. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother is confused and needs help. But he doesn't need an executor. An executor is appointed by the probate court after your brother passes away (and would typically be designated executor in his will). A power of attorney usually looks after a person's finances while they have diminished capacity; a durable power of attorney would continue to carry out these duties after if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. A conservator/guardian would be appointed by the courts to oversee his financial, physical and medical wellbeing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Take immediate steps to safeguard your brother's safety: He may need an assessment for dementia or cognitive impairment from a neurologist or geriatrician. I hope that the assisted-living facility is aware of this change of behavior, and is equipped to help him navigate this next stage. You will all need to work together until you figure out the next steps for your brother. Questions remain: What kind of power of attorney document currently exists? What legal capacity does your brother have to make decisions for himself - everything from hiring a new lawyer to revoking a POA? Has your brother been actually diagnosed with dementia? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A durable power of attorney would continue if/when your brother becomes incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, you will require health advocates and a competent lawyer. If the lawyer mentioned in your letter is not equipped to deal with your brother's situation - and it could be so given his reaction to the decline in your brother's health - you need a new lawyer to oversee your brother's affairs; as his joint powers of attorney, you can help him to appoint one. They will be able to help outline your options, which will depend on what kind of POA you hold and whether or not your brother requires conservatorship/guardianship, which should be a last resort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Laws regarding a conservator/guardian vary by state. In Texas, you would need to file a petition with the court. \"A hearing will be held, and the judge will examine the evidence and make a decision,\" says Childs Legacy Law Firm in Houston. \"In the second instance, absent a pending petition, and in lieu of a family member, living will or another relevant document, the court will appoint a conservator. The conservator can be any number of people, like a friend, social worker, neighbor, church member, attorney, nurse [or] another qualified person.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     General conservatorship </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A general conservatorship is created when an adult - typically an elderly person but can be a younger adult person - cannot manage their finances or health due to deteriorated mental capacity or impairment caused by an illness or injury,\" it adds. \"While they recover from the illness or injury, a conservator may be appointed by a court to address their medical and financial needs.\" Reasons include a person falling into a coma, a form of dementia like Alzheimer's, head injury or a stroke that impairs their ability to think or express their wishes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating, quite suddenly. \"People who suffer from any of the above can become vulnerable to bad actors who may try to manipulate the situation for their own financial gain. These bad actors may, for example, attempt to divert your disability payments (fraud) or coerce you into changing a will (undue influence),\" the law firm says. It is always better to draft an estate plan while you have the legal capacity to write and sign such a document. Otherwise, it will be left up to the courts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your brother's condition appears to be deteriorating. He needs calm and legal protection. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Right now, your brother needs reassurance and validation, clear and comforting communication, a routine so he feels safe, and legal protection; document everything, especially his changes in behavior. If he does not already have a healthcare proxy or healthcare power of attorney, and your brother is not of sound mind, the courts will appoint one for him. If he is in assisted living, for example, there may come a time when you will have to move him to a full-time care facility. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the absence of long-term-care insurance or Medicaid, I assume you will use (or have used) the proceeds from the sale of his house to pay for his care. Selling a primary residence turns the home's equity from an exempt asset into countable cash, which often exceeds the strict monthly $2,000-$3,000 individual limit for Medicaid, which would lead to a temporary loss of benefits until those funds are spent. A trust and estate attorney can talk through your options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can do this. But you can't - nor should you - do it alone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am fearful': My ailing relative is being forced into assisted living.
