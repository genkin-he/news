Specific components of concern regarding the Rosewood Exuma proposal developed by Yntegra Group include:</p><ul class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--unordered\" data-v-7b473e83=\"\"><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">Dredging in shallow, clear waters that are actively used for boating, swimming, snorkeling and diving, permanently erasing the character and ecology of the bay that includes a 15-acre seagrass prairie and extensive marine life including sea turtles, thriving coral reefs and a conch nursery</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">Industrial dock construction and marine service traffic in a shared recreational area, shifting the shoreline from \"open water experience\" to \"commercial shipping lane\"</li><li data-v-7b473e83=\"\">A development layout that concentrates a supply ship dock, fuel storage, garbage storage, sewage treatment and power generators in the most visible, high-use waters and shoreline areas, where environmental impacts and conflicts with neighboring uses are hardest to avoid</li></ul><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"Big Sampson Cay is the kind of place Exuma built its reputation on,\" said Eric Carey, CEO of ONE Consultants and former executive director of the Bahamas National Trust, on behalf of SEA. \"These waters are part of Exuma's identity and its economy. If Yntegra's dredging reshapes the bay and industrial systems move to the shoreline, you don't get the original place back. The question is whether our environmental protections mean what they say when a high-profile resort plan puts those waters at risk.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Judicial Review is the first major test of those protections, recently created by new environmental laws in The Bahamas will be enforced in the case of resort plans like that by Yntegra Group, which relies heavily on dredging and industrial marine infrastructure.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The Alliance maintains that the conflict is not inevitable. SEA, supported by coastal development experts, has outlined practical adjustments that would eliminate dredging in North Bay, relocate service docks to existing deep-water access on the southern side of the island and move fuel and back-of-house operations away from the northern shoreline.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"These are practical revisions,\" the Alliance said. \"They would remove the environmental flashpoint, reduce long-term operational risk and allow responsible development to proceed without permanent damage to shared waters.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">If the current plan proceeds unchanged, SEA said implications extend beyond one cay.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\"This decision will signal whether large-scale coastal projects in The Bahamas can prioritize judgment over spectacle,\" the Alliance said. \"It will clarify the expectations placed on developers operating in environmentally sensitive marine environments and hold Yntegra Group accountable for a plan that threatens both the marine environment and the tourism economy it supports.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629953-1&amp;h=1566091994&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.saveexumaalliance.org%2F&amp;a=saveexumaalliance.org\" tabindex=\"0\">saveexumaalliance.org</a>.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Media Contact:</strong><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>Brian Price<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:bprice@drivepathadvisors.com\" tabindex=\"0\">bprice@drivepathadvisors.com</a><br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/>906-458-9781</p>\n<span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922878/Save_Exuma_Alliance_Logo.html\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922878/Save_Exuma_Alliance_Logo.jpg\"/></picture></span>\n</a>\n</p>\n</span>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img mdc-article-image__img--12-width\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\" style=\"width:12px;\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY98506&amp;sd=2026-03-01\"/></picture></span> View original content to download multimedia:<a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/court-review-of-rosewood-exuma-plan-puts-spotlight-on-yntegra-groups-development-model-302700285.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/court-review-of-rosewood-exuma-plan-puts-spotlight-on-yntegra-groups-development-model-302700285.html</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">SOURCE Save Exuma Alliance</p></span>\n<span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY98506&amp;Transmission_Id=202603010900PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY98506&amp;DateId=20260301\"/></picture></span>\n</div>",

AFP correspondents and residents reported hearing fresh explosions across the Gulf cities of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha and Manama as Iran pressed its retaliatory campaign. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors anxiously awaiting the resumption of oil trading on Sunday after U.S. and Israel attacks on Iran might be getting a preview as shares of Saudi Arabia's $1.6 trillion state-owned oil company surged. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of Saudi Aramco (SA:2222), the world's biggest oil company and top producer, climbed 3% in Riyadh, where the trading week runs from Sunday through Thursday. The Saudi Arabia All Share Index, though, was down 2%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The jump in those shares was a potential precursor of what investors are facing later when oil futures begin trading, along with U.S. equity futures trading. Oil prices finished Friday at their highest level in roughly seven months as traders grew increasingly wary of a prospective U.S. attack on Iran, which became a reality by Saturday morning. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     April West Texas Intermediate crude (CLJ26) rose 2.8% in the week's final trading session to settle at $67.02 a barrel - its highest finish since Aug. 1. The contract also was up 2.8% for February overall, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Now-expired April Brent crude climbed 2.5% to settle at $72.48 a barrel, the highest point since July 31, gaining 2.5% for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Here's how much you could pay for a gallon of gas by May because of the attacks on Iran </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Talk of $100-a-barrel-oil surfaced almost immediately on Saturday as the attack on Iran by Israel and the U.S., and its repercussions, are seen putting at risk crude-oil shipments via the Strait of Hormuz. That maritime chokepoint crucially allows cargo ships to pass from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the production and flow of crude oil out of the Middle East. Iran is among one of the world's top crude-oil producers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As some have pointed out on the social-media platform X and elsewhere, the Strait of Hormuz is not just for crude-oil shipments, with fertilizer also traversing the waterway. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that oil and gas shipping in the strait had largely come to a halt, with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps reportedly warning ships that the passageway was not safe. Marine insurance companies have been canceling policies for ships traveling through the strait, and 50% price hikes in the next few days are likely, the Financial Times reported on Saturday, citing brokers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fresh explosions were heard in Tehran on Sunday, as new attacks on U.S. bases in Dubai and Oman were carried out, as the Revolutionary Guard Corps warned of \"devastating\" retribution over the killing of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Saturday's attacks, the Wall Street Journal reported. In a Truth Social media post on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that if such retaliation occurs, \"we will hit them with a force that has never been seen before!\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Elsewhere, at Sunday's monthly meeting of eight major oil producers, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, or OPEC+, voted to raise production by 206,000 barrels per day starting in April, according to a statement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The group had been raising production quotas for most of last year but paused for the first quarter of 2026 amid expectations of a global oil-supply surplus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'By attempting to draw [Gulf Cooperation Council] nations into the conflict, the [Revolutionary Guard Corps] appears to be provoking countermeasures that could create a pretext for strikes on regional oil installations, a move that would significantly escalate disruption risks.'Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said in a statement on X that the agency was \"actively monitoring events in the Middle East &amp; the potential implications for global oil &amp; gas markets and trade flows.

Other major events included the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine four years ago and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision in 2014 to keep oil (CL.1) (BRN00) output steady despite worries about a global supply glut. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disruptions also swept up U.S. crude and oil-product supply when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017, while the Trump administration's previous \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran, including rounds of new sanctions, led to a rally in oil prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amid this new conflict, said De Haan, there's still a \"very cloudy outlook\" in terms of what level of retaliation Iran might pursue - with, notably, the supreme leader's death now confirmed - and what that may mean for global supply and demand balances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Iran conflict raises talk of a return to $100-a-barrel oil </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans will be very anxious about what the conflict could mean for oil prices, given how President Donald Trump made low oil prices his \"signature policy,\" De Haan said. This certainly has potential to \"offset lower energy prices for some time,\" De Haan said, and motorists are going to feel \"a bit more a pinch\" in prices, which typically happens in the springtime as demand and prices edge higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $2.957 early evening on Saturday, according to GasBuddy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prices were already seeing a \"slow, steady uptick\" with spring-break travel right around the corner, said De Haan, and as temperatures warm up, fuel demand increases from now though mid to late July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The attacks on Iran will exacerbate that increase, he said, though it's not likely to be on the level of the \"superspike\" seen in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when retail gas prices briefly topped $5 in June of that year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The national average could climb between 25 cents and 50 cents a gallon between now and April or May to the mid-$3 range, said De Haan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And if things go \"bad at every turn,\" he said, consumers could potentially see prices rising by even more than 50 cents a gallon. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.

Other major events were the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision in 2014 to keep oil (CL.1) (BRN00) output steady despite worries about a global supply glut. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Disruptions also swept up U.S. crude and oil-product supply when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017, while the Trump administration's previous \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran, including rounds of new sanctions, led to a rally in oil prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the new conflict, there's still a \"very cloudy outlook\" in terms of what level of retaliation Iran may pursue and what that may mean for global supply and demand balances, said De Haan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Iran conflict raises talk of a return to $100-a-barrel oil </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans will be very anxious about what the conflict could mean for oil prices, given how President Trump made low oil prices his \"signature policy,\" he said. This certainly has potential to \"offset lower energy prices for some time, and motorists are going to feel a \"bit more a pinch\" in prices, which typically already happens in the springtime as demand and prices edge higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $2.957 early evening on Saturday, according to GasBuddy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prices were already seeing a \"slow, steady uptick\" with spring break travel right around the corner, said De Haan, and as temperatures warm up, fuel demand increases from now to mid- to late-July. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The attacks on Iran will exacerbate that increase, he said, though it's not likely to be on the level of the \"superspike\" seen in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when retail gas prices briefly topped $5 in June of that year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The national average could climb between 25 cents to 50 cents a gallon between now and April or May to the mid-$3 range, said De Haan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And if things go \"bad at every turn,\" he said, consumers could potentially see prices rising by even more than 50 cents a gallon. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.
