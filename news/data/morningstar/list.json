Management will be looking to convince investors that the company's chips are resonating, beyond a recent 6-gigawatt agreement with OpenAI that won't become much of a factor until the latter part of next year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While the OpenAI deal is focused on next-generation chips, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri will be watching trends in the current MI355x line as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Our sense is that, following the initial tool-up in [the second half], many customers seem to be pausing on MI355x and waiting for MI455 racks next year - not a huge issue, but something we think about given the recent rally in shares after signing the [OpenAI] deal,\" Arcuri wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Here's why OpenAI wants a stake in AMD </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's also interested in how customers are viewing AMD's graphics processing units relative to application-specific integrated circuits from Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Companies are diversifying beyond Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), but when it comes to Nvidia alternatives, \"recently things seem to have tilted in favor of ASICs,\" Arcuri noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Google shows off its semiconductor prowess with a new Anthropic deal </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That said, there's more to AMD's business than AI accelerators. \"No one really talks about servers as much as they do accelerators, but the server business has bounced back pretty nicely,\" Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the company's last earnings call, Chief Executive Lisa Su said that AMD's businesses of selling central processing units for servers and personal computers were \"accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio and expanded go-to-market investments.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"All of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well,\" she added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How much AMD's earnings will move the stock remains to be seen, since so much of its recent momentum stems from business that's farther out than the present day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But for now, the setup into the print as a result admittedly looks solid; core markets (PCs, servers) are looking better in the near term, they continue to take oodles of share, and as the OpenAI ramp doesn't even start for a year, a tremendous amount of pressure has probably been removed from any nearer-term AI expectations,\" Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon wrote recently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rasgon asked whether anyone would really care if AMD missed AI expectations for the fourth quarter, given the magnitude of what lies ahead. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See also: Can AMD's stock live up to the hype? Depends on how you look at it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In looking at overall third-quarter expectations, analysts tracked by FactSet are calling for $1.17 in adjusted earnings per share on revenue of $8.8 billion. For the fourth quarter, the consensus view calls for $1.32 in adjusted EPS and $9.2 billion in total revenue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This also won't be the only time investors are hearing from management in the near future, as the company is due to host an investor day on Nov. 11. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We think AMD may opt to hold off on big news until then,\" Arcuri wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stocks just logged their best midyear stretch since 1950. Is it time to take some profits? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its best midyear stretch since the 1950s. Now it's a question of taking some profits or holding for a rally at year-end. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the S&amp;P 500 on pace for a 16% yearly gain already, investors find themselves at a familiar crossroads: lock in profits while they are hot, or stay greedy and bet on a typical year-end rally that could push stocks to new highs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The S&amp;P 500 SPX just defied one of Wall Street's most entrenched seasonal clichés - \"sell in May and go away\" - with its strongest May-through-October stretch since 1950. Historically, this six-month stretch is the worst seasonal period for stocks, with an average gain of only 2.1%, according to data compiled by LPL Financials. But this time, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 22.9% during the period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up nearly 17% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP surged 36%, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     History also shows that when stocks resist the \"sell in May\" slump with double-digit summer gains, the rally often has more room to run. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 12% from November through April in such cases, outpacing the market's usual 7% return during its most favorable six-month window, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial (see chart below). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     SOURCE: LPL Research, Bloomberg </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As October drew to a close, investors turned their attentions to the final two months of the year - a period that's historically bullish - while wondering whether a year-end rally is already underway. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     History suggests that the S&amp;P 500 has shined the brightest in November and December, averaging a 3.1% gain during those two-month periods since 1945, while logging positive returns 76% of the time, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To be sure, seasonal trends do not always translate into reality and should always be viewed in the context of current market conditions. Seasonality simply reflects the broader market climate rather than the immediate setup on Wall Street - meaning stock performance through year-end doesn't have to follow any seasonal script, LPL's Turnquist noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After all, \"economic conditions, earnings, geopolitics, along with fiscal, monetary and trade policy, are much bigger drivers of price action\" in the stock market this year, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Stovall told MarketWatch that macro forces also support the case for a year-end rally. His CFRA team continues to see stock prices advancing through the end of 2025 on \"an improvement in earnings-growth expectations\" combined with potentially another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're still looking for two Fed rate cuts in 2026, so that could also help to shore up stock prices, at least through the end of April,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Will the Fed cut interest rates in December? Here's what experts are saying. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. central bank last week voted to lower the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 3.75% and 4%, and officially announced its plan to stop shrinking its portfolio of assets beginning Dec. 1. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned investors against assuming another rate reduction will follow in December, saying it's \"not a foregone conclusion\". </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As a result, investors have scaled back expectations for a December rate cut, with fed-funds futures traders on Friday only pricing in a 69% chance of a rate reduction at the end of the year, down from 90% before the October policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Here's what a government shutdown means for markets - and your wallet </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, investors can't ignore the political storm clouds gathering in Washington. The ongoing government shutdown - now stretching into its second month - is beginning to ripple through the economy and straining American households. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The longer the government shutdown lasts, the bigger of a potential drag it could have on consumer confidence, said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at SimCorp. \"So far, we haven't seen the impact, but I've got to imagine that eventually we are going to see the impact, as people are not getting paid or [receiving] food benefits,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, while also scoring weekly and monthly gains. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 2.3% in October, while the Dow was up 2.5% and the Nasdaq surged 4.7% for the month, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Joy Wiltermuth contributed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are glimmers of hope - from nanotechnology and brain games, to diet and exercise </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not all of the findings require medical intervention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     How likely are you to develop Alzheimer's, or another form of dementia, when you get older? The chances are probably a lot better than you think. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About half-a-million Americans develop dementia every year, and that figure is projected to double to 1 million by 2060. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Researchers earlier this year reported that those over the age of 55 have about a 42% chance of developing dementia before they die, or more than  a 2-in-5 probability. That includes more than a third of men and nearly half of women. Women face a higher risk because they typically live longer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the good news is that promising new research on how to treat dementia has been coming on multiple fronts lately. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A team of scientists from China, Barcelona and London have just reported that they have been able to use nanotechnology to reverse the symptoms of dementia in mice. Their technology got the brain to clear away as much as 45% of the amyloid-beta protein clumps associated with dementia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's pretty exciting,\" says Dr. Jagan Pillai at the Cleveland Clinic, a neurologist who is an expert in dementia. He says the research is especially interesting because it offers a new way for scientists to think about removing these damaging proteins. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     David Gates, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, says the findings are \"highly intriguing\" and represent \"a pretty clever strategy\" for removing amyloid from the brain. But, he adds, the findings are \"very preliminary and need replication. I am interested to see where they take it, but it is far from being used clinically on humans.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The researchers themselves, contacted by MarketWatch, confirmed that even if all their research continues to go well, it would be five to seven years before human trials. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But that's a lot better than nothing - which, until recently, was all medicine could offer those with dementia. If one of the world's most famous people, the actor Bruce Willis, can't be helped, what is available for the rest of us? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And the latest development isn't an isolated instance: Promising and hopeful research in dementia has been coming thick and fast of late. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several studies this year - such as this one from Bristol University in Britain, this one from Galway in Ireland, and this one from Britain's Cambridge University - have found that drugs already on the market, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, can help materially lower your risk of getting dementia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another study, based on data from Wales, found that vaccinating people against shingles may lower their risk of getting dementia by 20%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And a global team of researchers led by those at Washington University in St. Louis have reported promising findings from a specific experimental drug designed to reduce amyloid plaques in the brain. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But just as interesting are the findings that aren't about medical interventions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, researchers at McGill University in Toronto have just published research that regular use of a popular brain-training app on your phone, BrainHQ, can make your brain younger. A 10-week study undid about 10 years' worth of brain aging, they found. Astonishing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A study published recently in the journal Nature confirmed that various versions of the so-called Mediterranean diet - meaning whole grains, fresh vegetables and fruit, fish, olive oil and so on - lower your risk of getting dementia. (Lots of red meat, processed foods and sugar, meanwhile, raise your risk.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And a new paper in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry reports that finding purpose in your life seems to cut your risk of getting dementia. (This may not come as a surprise to anyone who has read Viktor Frankl's memoir, \"Man's Search for Meaning.\") </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Scientists are also learning more about the causes of dementia, such as pollution, insomnia and drinking alcohol. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A recent report in the American Journal of Medicine concluded that up to 45% of dementia cases might be prevented through things we can do on our own - including eating right, getting exercise and staying socially involved in our older years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     (Earlier this year, researchers reported that staying sociable could delay dementia by a remarkable five years.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The social and economic burden of dementia is devastating: The University of Southern California puts the figure at $781 billion this year, though that's just an estimate. They reckon family and friends spend 6.8 billion hours looking after people with dementia, which they value at $233 billion, or $34 an hour. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But those gloomy projections for the future rest on two pessimistic assumptions: First, that individuals and society as a whole won't take the steps needed to slash the risks; and second, that scientists won't find massive breakthroughs in treatment. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Will those assumptions prove correct?

It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account. I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I have a considerable amount of unrealized capital gains in this fund and can't decide whether selling some or all of it and paying the taxes makes sense, or if I should wait through the coming decline.

It will receive a step-up in basis as an inheritance. With IRA withdrawals and Social Security, this man is enjoying some well-earned gravy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors should not make decisions about their portfolio based on a feared downturn in the S&amp;P 500 SPX.

Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity, the \"seven-year rule\" states that you should only invest money in the market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

A new generation of AI chips is forcing a non-negotiable and massively expensive upgrade from copper to optical technology.

(NOK) highlights how connectivity has become a bottleneck for AI. During its Tuesday GPU Technology Conference in Washington, Nvidia announced a $1 billion stake in Nokia as part of a strategic agreement to advance AI networking initiatives. The companies will aim to develop and commercialize 6G technology that integrates AI with the existing radio access network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a note earlier this week, Mizuho trading-desk analyst Jordan Klein called optical-networking stocks \"the least understood and probably least owned by retail investors\" compared with memory, power and semiconductor names.

Gastwirth predicts the optical-component market will grow more than 50% year over year in 2025 and continue the momentum into 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some of these names, such as Astera Labs, Credo, Macom and Semtech, produce semiconductors that enable high-speed data transmission over fiber optics. Companies like Lumentum and Coherent build optical modules, which are the components that create and receive the light signals for fiber-optic communication. These modules are essential because light travels faster and more efficiently than electricity over copper wires. Fabrinet assembles and packages these optical components so they can be installed in high-performance routing and switching equipment from Arista and Ciena that is designed to manage data transfers and traffic across networks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When an AI server needs to send data from a graphics processing unit, light signals travel from switch to switch on specialty cables manufactured by Amphenol. Inside the switches, optical modules transform the light pulses into an electrical signal so chips can boost the strength and quality. The electrical signal is then converted back into light and travels toward another switch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Data centers need low latency and high-density bandwidth density,\" Gastwirth said, referring to fiber-optic technology's ability to transmit data faster and in greater quantities. \"You just need faster pipes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The volatility in these companies come from the boom-bust nature of the overall industry, which is characterized by customer concentration, constant technology updates and shifting supply-and-demand dynamics, according to Gastwirth. It's difficult for companies to maintain sustainably high margins, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Gastwirth anticipates that connectivity solutions will remain undersupplied in the near future, providing these companies with a boost. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's certainly not alone in thinking this. Last month, Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton got more optimistic about shares of Credo and Semtech. Credo's next-generation chips have demonstrated significant power advantages over competitors, Bolton wrote. And he added that Semtech is well positioned for the initial ramp of Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) (GOOGL) tensor processing units. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I don't think we're anywhere near an overproduction,\" Gastwirth said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: 5 bubble-resistant tech stocks to guard your portfolio from an AI crash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Christine Ji -Philip van Doorn </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Morey Stettner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taxes, investments, healthcare - everything adds up. Here's how to plan now to relocate later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Start early in figuring out where in the world to go. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The financial planning strategies you followed in America may no longer work as intended after you relocate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide to retire abroad, impulsivity works against you. Abruptly uprooting your life can expose you to financial (and emotional) shocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's better to plan ahead. \"People underestimate all the pieces that come into play,\" said Brett Bernstein, a certified financial planner in Bethesda, Md. \"The goal is to make sure they have the income they want to live off of.\" That takes months, even years, of research and preparation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Start early in figuring out where to go. Visit your top-tier destinations and consider the impact of inflation and taxes in those countries. \"Identify the income-tax rules in the country and in the local province where you might move,\" Bernstein said. \"What's the local sales tax? What other taxes are there?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From his experience advising clients who retire abroad, some Americans assume \"it'll be cheaper to live over there.\" The figure they can sell their U.S. house at a big profit, rent abroad and live happily ever after. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The challenge is accurately projecting the cost of living, especially nondiscretionary expenses (rent, taxes, insurance, etc.) in a new home. Advisers often use financial-planning software to map out scenarios that include currency swings, taxes and investment options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After deciding on a foreign destination, it's best to hire an international-tax adviser who specializes in tax laws in that country. Relocation consultants or attorneys can also help anticipate and address legal and logistical issues. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Portfolio shifts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Managing long-term currency risk plays a key role. Unfavorable exchange rates can erode spending power in the years after a move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Similarly, it's good to diversify investment portfolios to include stocks and bonds issued in the future home country. That's vital if it's a permanent move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Having international diversification in place is important,\" said Shane Cummings, a Denver-based certified financial planner. \"Beyond that, the most important thing you can do before moving abroad is to look into tax implications because [foreign] tax treaties can be complex. On the investment side, portfolio income can be taxed differently and that can lead you to make investment changes now.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Financial-planning strategies that worked in America may no longer work as intended after relocation. For example, some countries tax distributions from a Roth IRA - as well as taxing other sources of income from the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While planning well in advance of a move makes sense, risks abound. A stable country can be rocked by political instability. American retirees can quickly find themselves on the outside looking in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Don't assume today's dream destination will welcome Americans well into the future,\" said David A. Schneider, a New York City-based certified financial planner. \"There's a risk of backlash if lots of Americans stream into that country.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spain and Portugal, for instance, remain popular choices for American retirees. But their residency and language requirements are tightening up, along with property-investment restrictions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may be necessary to sever ties to well-liked financial advisers or brokerage accounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you become a permanent resident abroad, you'll need to find new financial [institutions] to work with you because the U.S. financial system will largely be cut off from you, even if the country is a strong U.S. ally,\" Schneider said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. financial custodians, such as banks and brokerages, have strict rules about continuing to serve Americans who relocate abroad. Increasingly, they are terminating accounts once they learn an American customer has left the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Your ability to invest in the U.S. can end without a legal U.S. address,\" said Mike Delgass, a New York City-based adviser. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare concerns </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n      If you move abroad, you will lose almost all your Medicare coverage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare is another factor that can affect a retiree's nest egg. Retirees abroad will lose almost all Medicare coverage. \"So you need to figure out how you'll fund healthcare in that country,\" Delgass said. \"It's a new expense for retirees to plan for. You may need private-pay or supplemental [health] insurance. Some countries subsidize it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And for those indecisive or prone to changing minds at the last minute, retiring abroad gets tougher and potentially more costly. Laying the groundwork methodically - researching costs and benefits and enlisting experts to ease the transition - works better for those sure they have found the right spot to retire. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Said Delgass: \"The worst thing is to do a ton of financial planning and then choose the wrong place.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: You can find quality, affordable healthcare if you retire abroad.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm a little fazed by the scrutiny she is being subjected to for such seemingly diligent practice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Credit-Card User, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your interest in your girlfriend's credit-card habits is intriguing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm torn. On the one hand, it's good that you're taking an interest in her financial behavior and habits and want to help her. On other hand, I'm a little fazed by the scrutiny she is being subjected to for such seemingly diligent practice (but only a little). It would be a lot worse if she was spending recklessly, racking up debt on her credit cards and not paying them off every month. Paying off her cards on an almost daily basis is unusual, granted, but not of immediate cause for concern. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a possible downside to your girlfriend's regular and meticulous credit-card payments: By paying off her balance every day, she is reducing her credit-utilization ratio to virtually zero. Having a low but healthy credit-utilization ratio - say, 10%, but below 30% - shows the credit bureaus that you are using your credit card responsibly. Your girlfriend may be showing up with a 1% or 0% credit-utiltization ratio, and thereby depriving the credit bureau of seeing her regular spending habits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some people wash dishes as they cook; others pay off their credit cards after every transaction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The other snag: If you're paying off your credit card every day, you may risk losing track of how much you spend. All of your transactions will, of course, show up, but your statement balance will likely be a big fat zero. How many times would you have to go through your bank balance to get an accurate sense of how much you have spent every month, if you did not have a starting and ending balance every month or quarter? Credit cards earn points and boost your credit score, if used correctly. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some people wash dishes as they cook; others pay off their credit cards after every transaction. She's not alone. As one member of the Moneyist Facebook group writes: \"I choose to get an alert from my credit cards whenever the balance is over $X and make a payment then. I also have a calendar reminder to make a payment just before the due date. Typically, I end up making two payments a month. As a backup/failsafe, I have an automatic payment set up for the statement balance on the due date.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I'm stumped': I put $3,000 on my credit card during a vacation and my credit score plunged. Why is it so volatile? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The main credit bureaus - Equifax (EFX), Transunion (TRU) and Experian (UK:EXPN) (EXPGY)) - don't calculate their scores in exactly the same way, so people's scores are typically dinged at different times and for slightly different reasons depending on the bureau. For instance, a FICO (FICO) score has five categories: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and credit mix (10%). In other words, FICO values consumers who stay on top of their finances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For anyone with several credit cards, there are ways to cancel them in order to limit the temporary hit to your credit score.You should close cards with the shortest credit history and get rid of cards with high annual fees, unless you're planning to get rid of a card that, say, gives you extremely generous travel rewards. Also, cancel cards with points that overlap, and close cards that are costing you an annual fee. In most cases, it's wise to axe store cards, which frequently have punitive interest rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     By paying off her balance every day, she is reducing her credit-utilization ratio to virtually zero. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is never a good time to rack up credit-card debt. This is not an ideal time, given the uncertainty around the labor market; the government shutdown; the Federal Reserve's caution about cutting interest rates as deeply as the White House, among others, might like; President Donald Trump's ongoing negotiations with other major economies over tariffs, and the impact increased tariffs will have on inflation; and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and Russia's war in Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ultimately, your 40-something girlfriend is displaying white-flag behavior. It's hard to wave a red flag over someone who keeps on top of their credit-card debt. Speaking of which, credit-card balances rose by $27 billion during the second quarter of 2025 and now top $1.21 trillion; that's almost a 6% increase over a year ago. Does your girlfriend have an emergency fund, a well-paid and secure job, a 401(k) or IRA, high-yield savings accounts, and a road map to retirement? Do you? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Sometimes, the best financial advice starts at home. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My son's credit-card company will write off $10K on a $25K debt.

However, he has early-onset dementia, which has turned our lives upside down. I am in my mid-60s, at retirement age now, but I plan to work much longer. The property can make income too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is our second marriage. Luckily, I did not mix our finances. He was self-employed and had this 10-acre home for 30 years. We almost lost everything when he got sick. He was $20,000 behind in the mortgage. We have to refinance next year and pay his business debts off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I increased my income. I got caught up on the mortgage and I am making all the household bills. I have gotten our living expenses as low as I can, and I have dental and healthcare insurance for both of us. I plan on working for many more years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The cheapest route is to keep the property and refinance next year. There is a lot of equity. Do I ask for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage when we refinance? We plan on keeping the property in the family with help from them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We do have a will and are securing everything to protect us. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Second Wife </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My boyfriend, 69, moved in. He refuses to pay more than $1,300 in rent and won't do yard work. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Wife, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You've faced up to this situation like a champ. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Rather than get caught with an endless loop of questions like \"Why us?\" you just got on with it. You increased your income, and you are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. You are using the one asset he has to pay off his debts, and you're doing so with the cooperation and assistance of his family. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether or not you decide to go for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage depends a) on the interest rate and b) on your husband and his estate's ability to pay off this loan. There may come a time where you will need to sell this house to pay for care when his dementia progresses, but you can only ever do one thing, one day at a time. He is fortunate to have you at his side. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other long-term plans you can make. Your husband would do well to sign a power-of-attorney document while he is of sound mind and has the legal capacity to do so, if he has not done so already. The power of attorney should be \"durable\" and should specify that you will make decisions on his behalf when he is incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He can also assign you to hold power of attorney for healthcare decisions. This will ensure that he has someone to act on his behalf in a medical context. If he does not wish to be on life support, for example, this advanced healthcare directive would say so. A living will and/or living trust can also provide additional instructions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My husband has dementia and will need care. Will Medicaid go after my money if I use it to pay off our mortgage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Importantly, setting up a trust would help your husband's executor - that is, you - to avoid probate. Making sure you have these documents in place before he enters mid- or late-stage dementia will prevent complications later on, like having to apply to be his guardian or conservator, which can be a lengthy and complicated process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is also the time to look into Social Security benefits for your husband. \"Someone with early-onset Alzheimer's who is younger than 65 can qualify for fast-track eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits,\" according to AARP. \"After two years of receiving SSDI benefits, they can qualify for Medicare before age 65.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your husband could also purchase a private supplemental policy, Medigap, or look into a Medicare Advantage plan. \"Medicare will cover hospice care, which provides as much comfort as possible to terminally ill patients in the last days or months of life,\" AARP notes. \"A doctor must certify that they have a life expectancy of six months or less.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, what you have created for yourselves after this diagnosis is something that was taken from you at that time: certainty. You may not know exactly how much time it will take for your husband's dementia to progress to the stage where he will need full-time care, but you have put in place enough financial safeguards to protect you both when you get there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am highly alarmed by the proposed changes to retirement accounts': I don't want bitcoin or private equity in my 401(k).
