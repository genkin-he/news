            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A D.A. Davidson analyst 'would not be surprised' if Palantir splits its stock, given that it caters heavily to retail investors and has seen a strong rally </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir reports earnings on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's been a quiet year for stock-split announcements among big companies, but momentum has picked up this week with ServiceNow Inc. and Netflix Inc. planning moves of their own. Will Palantir Technologies Inc. be next? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's something retail investors are watching for, according to Investor's Business Daily's coverage of a recent note from RBC Capital Markets. And D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told MarketWatch that while he didn't have any specific knowledge of a Palantir (PLTR) split announcement on the horizon, he \"would not be surprised\" if Palantir opted to pursue one, given that the stock caters largely to individual investors and has seen a big run-up in recent years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A stock split is also a sign of confidence Palantir could decide to send the market,\" Luria said in emailed comments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir didn't immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment on a potential split. The company reports third-quarter earnings on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The merits of stock splits are debatable now that fractional trading has become commonplace. Before that, high stock prices were viewed as relatively inaccessible to individual investors, but now investors who don't have, say, $5,000-plus to drop on a share of Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) can still get in on the action. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Management teams still cite accessibility when announcing splits, however. The CEO of ServiceNow (NOW), which is planning a 5-for-1 split of its stock that has been trading near $900, told MarketWatch earlier this week that a lower price will \"make it easy\" for \"consumer investors\" to get more involved with the shares. And Netflix (NFLX), which plans a 10-for-1 split of its $1,000-plus stock, said on Thursday that the new price will be \"more accessible to employees who participate in the company's stock-option program.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See more: Netflix plans 10-for-1 stock split that will take its price below $1,000 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cboe Global Markets analysts said in a 2022 report that splits can \"drive additional participation from retail investors\" but do not \"necessarily increase liquidity or attract investors' interest proportionally to the ratio at which the security was split,\" based on a look at split data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prior to the respective announcements from ServiceNow and Netflix on Wednesday and Thursday, things had been relatively subdued on the split front in 2025, with just three effective splits among S&amp;P 500 SPX components versus 18 last year in an unusually active period, according to recent data from Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Companies tend to split their stocks during bull markets,\" Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick told MarketWatch earlier this week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Palantir's stock has seen a particularly strong run, having opened at $10 following a direct listing in September 2020. Five years later, the stock is nearing $200, and it's up 157% in 2025 alone, enough to rank fifth among S&amp;P 500 gainers on the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More from MarketWatch: Palantir has a high bar to clear this earnings season. Can it deliver again? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jessica Hall </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ideas for reform churn up opposition from advocacy groups </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security provides benefits to about 75 million older adults, people with disabilities and surviving family members. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With Social Security's insolvency looming in about seven years, new proposals are emerging to reform a program that provides benefits for about 75 million Americans - yet the biggest advocacy groups for seniors are balking at many of the suggested changes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of the recent suggestions is from the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan policy analysis and research group. It has proposed that the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security should be limited in size for those with the largest benefits and highest lifetime income. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another group, the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a center-left think tank, has made several recommendations - including basing Social Security benefits on the number of years worked, rather than the earnings received over a lifetime. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The proposed reforms come as Social Security recently announced its annual COLA, which will add 2.8% to beneficiaries' benefits starting in January 2026. The COLA, which amounts to an average additional $56 to a beneficiary's monthly check, will be mostly offset by an expected increase in Medicare premiums that are automatically deducted from Social Security payments. Also, the COLA is backward-looking and reflects the inflation in 2025, not the inflationary pressures going forward that older adults still must grapple with. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security needs solutions </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's no shortage of ideas to repair the troubled program - and Americans have indicated they would be willing to sacrifice to save it - but so far, no legislative changes have been made. U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut, has been trying to fix Social Security's shortfalls since at least 2015, when he first introduced the Social Security 2100 Act. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The man who fixed Social Security when it went broke in the '80s has some advice for today's politicians </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the clock is ticking. If Congress doesn't act to shore up the program, the trust fund backing Social Security faces insolvency in 2033, at which point the fund would pay out only 77% of scheduled benefits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security's chief actuary, Karen Glenn, issued a warning in August that the insolvency date could be accelerated because of the Republican tax bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law this summer and included a temporary enhanced tax deduction for older Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Seven years is a lifetime for Congress, but it's not when you're trying to plan your retirement,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. The group plans to offer about a dozen different Social Security ideas over the next year to 18 months to spark discussion and encourage change, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The last time Social Security was overhauled was in the 1980s, but Congress waited until the last minute to address the problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If we wait until 2032 to address this, we'll have to make abrupt changes or do some borrowing,\" Goldwein said. \"There are big costs to waiting.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Goldwein said the typical couple would see an $18,400 annual cut to Social Security benefits if nothing is done to address the insolvency issue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Two proposals, in detail </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the CRFB plan, all beneficiaries would continue to receive a COLA, but there would be a cap that would limit the increase for retirees with the largest benefits and the highest lifetime incomes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Everyone still gets a COLA. It just doesn't go up with income,\" Goldwein said. \"The top quarter tends to have the most wealth outside of Social Security.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While there will likely need to be a mix of Social Security changes to address insolvency, Goldwein said the COLA cap idea \"is a good arrow to have in your quiver.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the PPI proposal, Social Security would pay benefits based on the number of years a person worked, rather than their earnings over their lifetime. That structure links Social Security's status as an \"earned benefit,\" said Ben Ritz, vice president of policy development and director of the Center for Funding America's Future at the Progressive Policy Institute. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This keeps Social Security as an earned benefit. Other proposals out there strain that link even further,\" Ritz said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the PPI proposal, anyone who works for at least 20 years would receive a benefit that keeps them out of poverty, in a way that would allow a low-income worker and their higher-wage boss to get the same benefit if they put in the same amount of work. Parents would also receive up to five years of credit for caregiving. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The PPI plan has many components, but some of the other aspects include increasing Social Security's retirement ages to reflect rising life expectancies while still keeping a special early retirement age for lower-earning workers who have not experienced the same gains in longevity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another PPI measure would change the formula behind the COLA to the chained consumer-price index for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U), rather than the current consumer-price index for urban workers (CPI-W). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the PPI proposals, taken together, the people facing the biggest hit financially would be the top one-fifth of the lifetime earners. Those cuts would be on par to the cuts already slated to occur under current law, the group said. The majority of beneficiaries would see no reduction in their monthly benefit, and many low-income or long-career workers would even receive greater benefits, according to the PPI proposal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     PPI said the suggested reforms, taken together, would close half of Social Security's shortfall over the next 30 years while also reducing old-age poverty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The percentage of older adults in poverty rose to 15% in 2024, up from from 14.2% the previous year and representing the highest poverty rate among all age groups, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Advocacy groups on alert </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AARP over the weekend sent out an email alert to its members about the various proposals, which were presented last week at a CRFB event on novel Social Security and Medicare reforms in Washington. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The last thing we need is D.C. insiders making decisions on our hard-earned money. AARP advocates always stand up to protect Social Security and Medicare, and together we'll fight any idea that puts our money in jeopardy,\" AARP said in the email alert. \"This week's COLA announcement already has some people wondering if they can cover rising costs. The LAST thing Americans 65-plus need is more questions and uncertainty about the Social Security they earned throughout their working lives.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Asked about that email, CRFB's Goldwein said: \"AARP fundraises off of scaring people. They're still at the fundraising stage, rather than the solutions stage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older adults, said it appreciated aspects of the proposals but still feels the best way to close the gap on Social Security insolvency is for wealthier Americans to pay Social Security taxes on all their earnings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The Progressive Policy Institute's proposal is certainly innovative. We appreciate the fact that they propose a long-term phase of at least 10 years. The Senior Citizens League has long advocated for the longest possible transition period for any changes to Social Security. As with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's proposal, this proposal also does not fix the problem of inadequate COLA,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of the Senior Citizens League. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Senior Citizens League has recommended that the COLA be based on the CPI-E, or consumer-price index for the elderly, which more closely resembles the goods being bought each month by retired Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Overall, the Senior Citizens League supports raising or removing the cap on the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax, known as the taxable maximum. That threshold will increase to $184,500 in 2026, up from $176,100 currently, according to the Social Security Administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The quickest and most straightforward way to address insolvency is to raise or remove the payroll cap. According to Social Security actuaries, raising the payroll cap to 90% rather than the current 82% would close about one-third of the long-term funding shortfall. Or, eliminating the cap entirely - taxing all earnings - would close around 70% to 75% of the long-term shortfall, depending on details of benefit adjustments,\" Benton said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, another advocacy group, Social Security Works, spoke out against both the CRFB and PPI proposals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Both of these proposals would make enormous cuts to Social Security's modest benefits. They do so by radically changing the system. Currently, Social Security is a defined-benefit pension plan designed to replace wages. The amount you receive is linked to what you earned and what you contributed while working,\" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"CRFB's proposal would weaken the link between earnings and benefits, while PPI's would demolish the link. Both of them are designed to move Social Security towards a poverty-level flat benefit,\" Altman said. \"Instead of trying to scam people out of their hard-earned benefits, we should require millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share into the system.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jessica Hall </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But consumers seeking relief should ask up front about any strings attached and take steps to protect their credit, experts warn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Take the assistance if you need it, but be aware of what the risks are before you do,\" said Alys Cohen, director of federal housing advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. \"Keep really good records and try to get things in writing from the lender and put things in writing yourself, even to confirm a phone call.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here are four tips to consider before accepting this kind of assistance from your bank or credit union: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read the fine print </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dozens of banks and credit unions are offering assistance for people impacted by the federal shutdown - but the terms of these programs differ widely depending on the financial institution, said Adam Rust, the director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They're providing relief in different types of scenarios, and it's important to understand exactly what you're signing up for when you take one of these arrangements,\" Rust said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, it's crucial to understand the distinction between zero-interest and accrued-interest programs. A zero-interest program means no interest is charged at all during the relief period, while an accrued-interest program pauses payments but continues adding interest in the background, which you'll still owe later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's essential to get details about the hardship program in writing, as well as contact information for a person at the financial institution who can answer questions. A misunderstanding or violation of the terms can wind up harming a person's credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Avoid the danger of a balloon repayment at the end of a forbearance period </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When money gets tight, many prioritize mortgage payments over credit cards, student loans or personal loans, said Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Homes right now are a big asset with a lot of home equity for a lot of people,\" said Kates, who is also a certified financial planner. \"That is a huge asset for them to hold on to.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Inflation is quietly chipping away at most Americans' main source of wealth </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers generally can get a full or partial forbearance, a temporary arrangement with a lender that allows them to pause or reduce their mortgage payments due to a financial hardship. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For those making partial payments, the amount will not count as a full, on-time monthly payment until the total collected equals the full required amount. It can also fall on the consumer to figure out if late fees will be waived during this time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A big danger that comes with mortgage forbearance is a potential balloon payment - when a lump sum of missed payments is owed at the end of a forbearance period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you have to pay a balloon payment at the end of the forbearance and you can't afford that, that could put you in a much more difficult situation,\" Cohen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Luckily, the current standard for many government-backed loans is to extend the term of the mortgage for the number of months missed. For instance, if you missed seven payments during forbearance, the loan is extended by seven months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: A government shutdown would hurt home-buying deals just as buyers are coming off the sidelines </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Keep in mind that interest payments are not paused during the forbearance period, \"but if you're trying to keep your home and stay in your mortgage and you could afford to resume the payments, it's a modest price to pay for getting the forgiveness.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Homeowners also need to stay on top of the forbearance timeline. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"People should find out if they're going to be notified when the forbearance ends or when they have to call to extend it and whether that's on them,\" Cohen said. \"They should have a whole calendar set up so they understand what the timeline is for their arrangement with their lender.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prioritize the roof over your head - but keep in mind these credit risks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lenders reporting payments to credit-reporting bureaus typically mark deferred payments for consumers enrolled in hardship programs with a special code indicating \"no information\" or \"deferral,\" which does not hurt their credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, this is an industry standard rather than legally binding law, so lenders can ignore it, resulting in negative marks for consumers, said Chi Chi Wu, the director of consumer reporting and data advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: This government shutdown could be the longest ever - maybe running until Thanksgiving. What might the economic damage be? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because the guidance isn't enforceable, a consumer's ability to fix the inaccurate negative credit reporting is limited and difficult. Consumers can be proactive by getting all hardship terms in writing to protect their credit, but the risk remains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Wu said, those facing dire straits due to the shutdown should prioritize essential needs like their mortgage or rent over immediate credit preservation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If your back is against the wall and you don't have enough money to pay all of your bills as a federal worker, pay the bills that are the most important, credit be damned,\" Wu said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Think long term </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With continuing uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last, Kates said, it's important to map out a plan beyond the relief options offered by your financial institution. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most programs, like those that allow borrowers to defer a single payment, are designed to offer short-term shutdown assistance and assume the worker's income will stabilize after a few weeks. Many are not built to defer multiple payments or several months' worth of fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is reaching a tipping point that could send the economy into a downward spiral </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To brace for the possibility of a longer-than-expected shutdown, consumers using hardship programs may need to look into secondary resources that can provide a \"backstop,\" he said. \"The job doesn't end by entering one program.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond financial institutions, the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund provides a list of additional resources. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over a million employees going without pay </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About 670,000 federal employees are furloughed and 730,000 are working without pay, the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates. If the shutdown extends to December, 4.5 million paychecks will be withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21 billion in missing wages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Military servicemembers are at risk of going without their first paycheck on Friday, according to the organization, which would be the first time in history that all military members go unpaid due to a shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The American Bankers Association has compiled a noncomprehensive list of banks of all sizes that are offering relief options for federal employees, which has received 35,000 page views so far, according to the trade group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Are you a federal worker not getting paid during the government shutdown? 4 ways to protect your finances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As of Tuesday, 81% of American credit unions were offering deferred payments on existing loans and 71% had launched new or modified relief programs, according to the trade group American Credit Unions.
