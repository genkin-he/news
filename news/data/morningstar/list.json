The highly anticipated agreement between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a muted response with market watchers saying China appeared set to maintain the rare-earth curbs introduced in the spring, and businesses expecting more rocky times ahead for U.S.-China commerce. Gold rose, while oil fell. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --U.S. futures for the S&amp;P 500 were up 0.6% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after both indexes closed lower Thursday following earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for the two companies. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Asia stocks were mostly lower, except Japan's Nikkei which closed up 2.1% after data indicated the economy is showing signs of improvement. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.8% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --All major indexes in Europe were lower, with London's FTSE down 0.3% and Germany's DAX 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 was down 0.15% and the Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, lead by the technology sector which was down 0.9%. Bucking the trend were Fuchs and Puig which were up 9.5% and 7.9%, respectively after third-quarter earnings. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in Asian trade across the curve except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small after this week's major central-bank policy decisions. The two-year Treasury yield was down 0.1 basis point at 3.612%, while the 10-year yield rose 1.2bps to 4.103%, according to Tradeweb. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Eurozone government bond yields rose in early trade, absorbing the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB left the key interest rates unchanged, as expected, and sounded relatively relaxed about the eurozone's growth outlook. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 0.8bp to 2.646%, according to Tradeweb. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The dollar remained higher, supported by reduced bets for another interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it was far from a done deal. The Fed delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. The DXY dollar index rose 0.1% to 99.658, close to the three-month high of 99.724 reached Thursday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Bitcoin recovered marginally but remains below the key $110,000 level following losses sustained overnight after a tech-led selloff in U.S. stocks. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Fed in December also weighed on risk appetite. Bitcoin rose 1.9% to $109,559 after reaching a one-and-a-half-week low of $106,396 late Thursday, LSEG data show. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   --Gold prices rose in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3% ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slipped 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 05:37 ET (09:37 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
