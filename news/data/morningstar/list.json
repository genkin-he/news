Rates have fallen overall since the start of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Falling mortgage rates are giving home buyers something they haven't seen in a long time: a glimpse of affordability. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average 30-year mortgage rate hit 5.98% as of Feb. 26, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.01% the prior week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A year ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.76%. Elevated mortgage rates and high home prices have forced many house hunters to put off buying plans in recent years. That's driven home sales down and pushed the average age of a first-time home buyer to an all-time high of 40. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But falling mortgage rates have now pumped up buyers' purchasing power. A household making the median income of about $86,300 can now \"comfortably afford\" a $331,483 home with a 20% down payment, according to a new analysis from the real-estate platform Zillow (Z). That's $30,000 more than a year ago, Zillow said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The median sales price of an existing home in the U.S. was $396,800 as of January, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"A more than $30,000 gain in buying power is meaningful for households that have been stretched thin by high rates. It can mean the difference between settling and choosing,\" noted Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow, in the report. \"That doesn't suddenly make this market affordable for everyone, but it does crack open doors that had firmly shut when rates peaked.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mortgage rates under 3% during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a rush of home buyers. But when rates soared to over 7% in late 2023 and home prices continued to tick upward, many would-be buyers were shut out of the market. That pushed home sales to 31-year low in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some see the chance for increased home sales in the coming months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For the first time in three-and-a-half years, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped into the 5% range, falling even lower than last week's milestone,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's (FMCC) chief economist. \"This rate, combined with the improving availability of homes for sale, is meaningful and will drive more potential buyers into the market for spring home-buying season.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Do you have questions about real estate that you would like to see covered in MarketWatch?

Profit attributable to owners of the Company stood at RM3.1 million, compared to a loss of RM3.6 million previously. The improved performance was primarily attributable to continued strong project execution and improved operational efficiency from the Group's core Construction and Support Services segment.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">On a full-year basis, Advancecon recorded revenue of RM423.1 million, representing an increase of 10.4% from RM383.2 million in FY2024. The Group reported a profit attributable to owners of RM6.7 million, compared to a loss of RM22.7 million in the previous year. This reflects a successful turnaround driven by improved operational performance, cost optimisation efforts, and more disciplined project management across its business segments.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Notably, FY2025 also marked an important milestone for the Group, with Advancecon delivering four consecutive quarters of profit attributable to owners of the Company during the financial year. This reflects greater operational stability and consistency following measures undertaken to strengthen execution and improve overall efficiency. The Group's consistent quarterly profit performance reflects a structurally stronger and more sustainable earnings base.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">As at <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">31 December 2025</strong> , Advancecon's outstanding order book stood at approximately <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">RM756 million</strong> , compared to <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">RM673 million as at 31 December 2024</strong> . This improvement has been supported by a series of strong contract wins secured over the past six months, with the Group securing new contracts totalling approximately RM229.5 million, reflecting continued participation in infrastructure and development projects. The order book provides ongoing work visibility for the Group's core construction activities. With a strengthened order book of approximately RM756 million and continued contract momentum, the Group is well-positioned to deliver sustained earnings growth over the next 24 months. The current order book provides strong earnings visibility through FY2027, underpinned by active participation in infrastructure and development projects.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Mdm. Phum Boon Eng, Managing Director of Advancecon Holdings Berhad</strong> , said: \"We are encouraged by the Group's return to full-year profitability and the consistency achieved over the past four quarters. This milestone marks not just a turnaround, but the beginning of Advancecon's next growth phase, as well as, the collective efforts of our team in strengthening execution, improving efficiency, and maintaining discipline in project delivery. With a strengthened order book we are confident in delivering sustainable earnings growth and long-term value for our stakeholders. We remain focused on operational stability and prudent project selection as we continue to carry out our existing works.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Advancecon's Construction and Support Services segment remained the primary contributor to revenue and profitability, supported by ongoing infrastructure and township development projects. The Group's quarry operations under Spring Energy Resources Berhad and its renewable energy segment also continued to contribute to the Group's overall operations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Advancecon's renewable energy subsidiary continues to operate its solar assets, including a 37.7MWp large-scale solar farm in Kuala Langat, Selangor, which commenced operations in November 2024, as well as rooftop solar installations.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Separately, the Group's joint development with Perak Corporation Berhad for the Silver Valley Technology Park in Perak remains part of its longer-term business activities, and represents a key long-term value creation platform for the Group, with significant earnings potential as development progresses over its multi-phase rollout.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Malaysia's construction sector continues to be supported by infrastructure and development activities across both public and private sectors. The Group remains focused on its core competencies in earthworks and civil engineering while continuing to execute its existing projects. The Group is also well-positioned to benefit from increasing infrastructure investments, industrial expansion, and renewable energy development in Malaysia, which collectively support sustained construction activity across key growth corridors.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Despite ongoing cost pressures arising from regulatory changes and industry competition, the Group's improving financial position, strengthening order book, and consistent operational execution provide a solid foundation for continued growth. Management remains confident that Advancecon is well-positioned to build on its turnaround momentum and deliver sustainable earnings improvement in the coming financial year.</p><span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">###</strong></p></span><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">ABOUT ADVANCECON HOLDINGS BERHAD</strong></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Founded in 1990, Advancecon is primarily involved in the provision of earthworks and civil engineering services in Malaysia, as well as related support services such as the sale of construction materials, hiring of machinery, and ad-hoc general construction services. The Group was listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia on 10 July 2017.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Advancecon's wide range of earthworks services encompass excavation and fill, rock-blasting, ground treatment works, erosion and sediment control plan, as well as compaction and surface finishing processes. On the civil engineering services front, Advancecon specializes in road works, drainage works, bridge construction, water supply works, and sewerage works.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To date, Advancecon has undertaken earthworks and civil engineering works for notable projects nationwide, including various township developments such as Bandar Setia Alam, Setia EcoHill, Setia Eco Gardens, Eco Majestic and Tropicana Aman, as well as infrastructure projects in relation to the construction of highways and railway such as West Coast Expressway (WCE), South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE), Trumpet Interchange and Ecohill Link connected to Lebuhraya Kajang Seremban (LEKAS) Highway and East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In 2019, Advancecon also established a renewable energy subsidiary, Advancecon Solar Sdn Bhd, which will undertake the development and/or operations of power generation from solar and other renewable energy projects. It currently owns revenue-generating rooftop solar assets of more than 1.2MWp and also a 37.7MWp large-scale solar farm in Kuala Langat, Selangor which commenced operation on 8 November 2024.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In 2021, Advancecon further completed the acquisition of a 51% stake in Spring Energy Resources Berhad (\"Spring Energy\"), which is an integrated quarry operation management and service provider involved in contract quarry operations, provision, marketing and management of quarry products, related advisory services, as well as the undertaking of quarry-related earthworks and civil engineering works.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">In 2024, Advancecon entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Perak Corporation Berhad to develop Silver Valley Technology Park (SVTP) on an 816-acre land in Kanthan, Perak, with an estimated Gross Development Value of RM1.0 billion, which is envisioned to be a state-of-the-art industrial park.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">For more information, please visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://pr.report/j5jp\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.advancecon.com.my/</a>.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Issued By: Swan Consultancy Sdn.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Joy Wiltermuth and Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The next 24 to 48 hours of conflict will be crucial for markets after the U.S. and Israel launched military strikes against Iran </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amoke rises in Tehran after U.S. and Israel launched a military attack. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. and Israel attacked Iran, leading Tehran to quickly retaliate with strikes within Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East after President Donald Trump called on Iranians to take over their government. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Those developments have raised questions about whether this conflict will last longer - and risk sweeping up more oil-producing nations - than the 10-day U.S.-Israel military operation in June targeting Tehran's nuclear facilities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This is different,\" said Ali Meli, founder and chief investment officer at Monachil Capital Partners, in a Saturday interview with MarketWatch. \"There's a belief that this may be more aimed at regime change, beyond nuclear deterrence.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     '[T]he question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical.'Ali Meli, Monachil Capital Partners </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Now, the question is if there will be a version of regime change like in Venezuela, or something more radical,\" said Meli. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What happens in the next 24 to 48 hours may provide clues to the potential scope of this conflict and its likely impact on markets, with Iran's oil infrastructure and the region's Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, now a major focus. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes were nearing, as Trump suggested to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The brief June 2025 conflict is a poor guide to what is likely to follow,\" said Nick Redman, analyst at Oxford Analytica, a geopolitical risk-analysis and advisory service owned by MarketWatch publisher Dow Jones. \"Then, Iran sought to avoid confrontation because it understood U.S. objectives were limited, meaning that regional relations and wider international legitimacy were worth preserving.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, however, Iran might look to \"hunker down or seek to draw out any conflict,\" according to Redman. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European leaders from Britain, France and Germany issued a statement Saturday saying their countries had not taken part in the Iran strikes, but they added that they had been in close contact with the U.S., Israel and partners in the region. They called for a resumption of negotiations, the Associated Press reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Clearly, there are more questions than answers in this first day of this,\" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told MarketWatch. \"But there are valid concerns that this could become a larger issue than in June.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Detrick said he's bracing for near-term weakness in equities, a likely spike in crude oil and for gold and other safe-haven assets to rise. \"At the same time, the U.S. economy is still strong, and it's been a strong earnings season,\" he said, adding those factors as being a support for equity prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, investors have endured a violent rotation under the surface of the stock market in February, with investors looking for cover from artificial intelligence disruptions and cracks in credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That could spell a difficult start to March for stocks, plus the \"black cloud overhead\" from the Iran conflict, Detrick said. \"To think we are going to have a calm start to March probably isn't on anyone's bingo card.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Should a longer, more complicated conflict unfold, the U.S. could tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to keep a lid on oil and gasoline prices. U.S. benchmark crude shot up to over $130 a barrel in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the U.S could quickly ramp up domestic production given its shale resources, and it also now exerts control over Venezuela's oil, Meli at Monachil Capital said.

Plenty of comments soon followed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Who needs to dress up? Some airline passengers opt for comfort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These days, it's not unusual to see people sporting pajamas outside the home - for a walk in the park or even when dining at a fancy restaurant. The trend of sleepwear as everyday wear is all the rage, according to fashion experts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But if you're considering joining the pajama party, should you think twice if your travel plans include a stop in Tampa, Fla.? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a post on X that went viral - with 7.1 million views as of Thursday afternoon - Tampa International Airport announced that \"It's time to ban pajamas.\" The post went on to say that \"The madness stops today\" and also referenced an earlier ban on Crocs at the airport. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To be clear, the airport's \"bans\" are actually intended as something of a joke. But officials explained they are meant to raise awareness of issues surrounding what constitutes appropriate travel wear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Tampa International Airport regularly shares lighthearted, satirical social-media content as part of our ongoing effort to engage with our followers,\" the airport said in a statement to MarketWatch. \"Today's post about 'banning' pajamas was another playful nod to day-of-travel fashion debates. We encourage our passengers to travel comfortably and appreciate our loyal followers who enjoy the online humor.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Certainly, if sparking debate was the goal, the post did just that. Even if some who commented on the post didn't necessarily understand that the \"ban\" was in jest, they pointed to the era when people dressed up to fly, as if they were attending a special occasion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Let's go back to the way it was in the '50s, '60s and '70s!\" said one commenter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Others said it's not worth it to dress up, especially given the hassles now often associated with air travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I'll dress nice again when we're not treated like cattle at the airport and on the plane,\" said another commenter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Let's not also forget how the issue came to light, when U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy encouraged travelers to upgrade their wardrobe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Let's try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport,\" Duffy said at Newark Liberty International Airport last November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Regardless of how anyone feels about pajamas as everyday wear, including at the airport, the trend is decidedly there. Global pajama sales are expected to total nearly $12.5 billion this year and are projected to grow to roughly $21.5 billion by 2035, according to one research report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Experts say the trend has been accelerated by the shift to remote work in recent years - in effect, why dress up if you're not leaving the house? At the same time, people are embracing the idea of going super-casual outside the home, which means pajamas at the airport or just about anywhere else. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fashion brands have jumped on the trend, offering loungewear styles that can work in a variety of settings. Celebrities have been quick to follow suit: Think Margot Robbie sporting pink pajamas at a movie screening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'You can't degrade the travel experience for decades and then scold people for dressing to endure the experience.'Etiquette expert Nick Leighton </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So, are you free to wear those PJs as you get ready to board your next flight? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Etiquette expert Nick Leighton says it's a hard question to answer for a number of reasons. He points to the aforementioned issue of airline travel becoming more stressful and uncomfortable - hence, the desire to go more casual. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can't degrade the travel experience for decades and then scold people for dressing to endure the experience,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Plus, as sleepwear styles become more fashionable, it's hard to think of them as strictly for the slovenly set. \"What exactly counts as pajamas?\" Leighton said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Patrick Arnzen, a former airline pilot who's now chief executive of Thrust Flight, a pilot school, says being comfortable on a flight isn't a bad idea from a health standpoint. He points to the need to maintain good circulation and avoid deep vein thrombosis (in other words, a blood clot), which is always a risk during air travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"That's why I recommend breathable fabrics, compression socks if you're prone to swelling, and always layers,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, Arnzen points out the risk of going too casual. For example, he says you don't want to be sporting flip-flops or sandals in the event of an emergency. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wear something that \"won't slow you down if you ever need to exit quickly,\" Arnzen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

That's a problem in this \"no hire\" economy, as one economics writer put it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More than 9 in 10 people said they didn't have a side gig in retirement, but 60% wished they did, according to a survey by the financial-services firm D.A. Davidson. This comes in the middle of what people are calling a \"no hire\" economy, where finding work in retirement is becoming a struggle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consider these statistics about the deep freeze in the labor market: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- People think they have only a 43% chance of finding work in the next three months if they lose their job, the lowest level in 12 years, a New York Fed survey in December said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- The U.S. added essentially zero jobs over the last five months and just 44,000 a month last year, the lowest since the pandemic recession. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- 37% of workers surveyed by the Employee Benefit Research Institute said they've seen hiring freezes at their employers in the past 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- The 108,435 layoffs announced in January - including huge job cuts at Amazon AMZN and UPS UPS -were the highest to start a year since 2009, according to the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- 81% of recruiters post \"ghost jobs,\" positions that are nonexistent or have already been filled, a MyPerfectResume survey found. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And that's affecting workers across all ages, not just older individuals who may face the additional struggles of age discrimination in the workplace or hiring process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"There's a sense of precarity in the air. I think it's going to be a rough year,\" said Kerry Hannon, author of \"Great Jobs for Everyone 50+,\" at the recent Trendspotting 2026 webinar about older workers. The webinar was offered by the Encore Network, a nonprofit championing people over 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Why is job hunting so tough these days? Many employers are reluctant to hire workers, including people looking for part-time jobs in retirement, because they're apprehensive about the economy. Consumer spending is expected to slow, and businesses are turning to AI as an alternative to bringing on staff for things like customer service and data entry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's more, said Isaiah Hankel, author of the new book \"Too Good to Get Hired,\" America has an \"overqualified\" crisis, with employers routinely snubbing older job applicants due to their age and years of experience. \"'Too good to get hired' sounds like an oxymoron, right?\" he said. \"You would think it's impossible to be too good to get hired. But the data shows this is just not the case.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hankel, the older-worker experts at the Encore webinar panel and LinkedIn authorities have seven smart tips for finding jobs in retirement: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For anyone preparing to retire, review your finances and start thinking about where to look for part-time work </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're nervous, 2026 is a year to plan, said panelist Chris Farrell, senior economics contributor at American Public Media's Marketplace radio program and author of \"Unretirement.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Come up with a budget you can control and reach out to people in your network,\" he advised. Then, Farrell noted, you might be able to say to yourself: \"If I make this amount of money, I'm going to be OK financially not making as much as I did before.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spend more time networking than applying to online job listings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most online job applications result in a 0.1% to 2% success rate, according to the HiringThing blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can't rely on job boards the way you used to,\" Hankel said. A Congressional Research Service report said 27% of all U.S. job listings on LinkedIn are likely ghost jobs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consider boomeranging part time to the employer you retired from </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Boomeranging used to be something companies would avoid; there was a stigma attached to it,\" Farrell said. \"That has changed dramatically, because the employer knows who the person is and what they can do.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When applying for jobs in retirement, play up what you can do for an employer - not what you've done </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Make more potential-based statements, not just proof-based statements about your prior work,\" Hankel said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fix your LinkedIn Profile to be a stronger job candidate </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The LinkedIn social-media platform recently launched an AI-powered ranking and recommendation system called 360Brew, which makes job candidates get seen more - or less - depending on how they appear to the algorithm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The 360Brew system favors consistency, linear careers and clear titles, wrote Viveka von Rosen, a career adviser for women age 50-plus, in a LinkedIn post. She recommends ensuring your LinkedIn headline isn't vague, your About section isn't bloated and your Experience section doesn't read like a \"resumé archive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Speaking at an Encore webinar about \"the new LinkedIn,\" communications specialist Debra Yearwood recommended writing a LinkedIn headline that combines your desired position and your skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yearwood also advised amplifying your LinkedIn profile's Experience section by showing your personal brand. \"Put in a bit of a description of the work you did at a job, the organization itself and your achievements there,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Be sure to include the skills you've acquired, and that your top two show up at the beginning of your profile. Ask former colleagues to endorse those two skills, too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Look for jobs in fields related to the aging of the U.S. population </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We have a critical mass of baby boomers who are getting older, and a Silent Generation who's getting even older. They need access to products, services and care,\" said panelist Catherine Collinson, who publishes the Transamerica Institute's annual Transamerica Retirement Survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hannon calls this \"riding the age wave,\" and notes that getting hired to serve the health needs of older adults doesn't require a medical background. \"You could be a healthcare accountant or a project manager or use skills from a previous job,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Deflect employers' ageist hiring practices by starting a business in retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a recent Harris Poll, 69% of professionals said owning a business is the best protection against ageism in the workforce, antiageism advocate Janine Vanderburg wrote on LinkedIn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While running a small business could be a lot to manage in retirement, there are some options that play into a retiree's experiences and skills. For example, among the 25 fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. for 2026, according to LinkedIn: strategic advisers, independent consultants, and founders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Solo entrepreneurship is continuing to grow,\" Farrell said. \"That's probably the one part of the job market to be the most optimistic about.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Richard Eisenberg </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
