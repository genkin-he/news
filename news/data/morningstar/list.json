Designed to power mixer operation without engine idling, the system addresses one of the ready-mix industry’s most persistent operational challenges — unnecessary idling during loading, waiting, and pouring — while supporting lower fuel use, reduced emissions, reduced regens, and improved total cost of ownership.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227931870/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227931870/en/</a></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDeveloped over the past three years and built on more than a decade of electrification and hybrid development, field testing, and multi-generation engineering refinement, e-HYDRIVE delivers full drum performance at the jobsite with the chassis engine off. Early field testing demonstrates measurable reductions in idle time and fuel consumption across daily production cycles.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nTraditionally, mixer trucks must run the chassis engine to power the drum during loading, waiting, and pouring. e-HYDRIVE changes that model. The self-charging, non-plug-in hybrid system powers the drum electrically, with the battery automatically charging while the truck is driving, and includes built-in operational redundancy that allows the truck to operate traditionally if needed.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDesigned for both new builds and retrofits, e-HYDRIVE requires no significant modification to existing mixer components, allowing seamless integration across active fleets while minimizing downtime.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our customers have consistently told us they need practical electrification solutions that work in real production environments — not theoretical concepts,” said Bryan Datema, Executive Vice President – Engineering, Innovation, and Product Performance, Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery. “e-HYDRIVE was engineered alongside those needs. It reduces unnecessary idling, lowers operating costs, and prepares fleets for the future of electrified chassis platforms without disrupting daily operations.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs part of its development, e-HYDRIVE has operated in active production environments with Amrize, an industry-leading concrete producer known for evaluating emerging technologies. This collaboration allowed Revolution | London to validate durability, usability, and real-world performance under demanding operating conditions while maintaining full ownership of product design and specifications.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“This has been a long-term testing effort across multiple generations of the system,” said Ian Paine, Amrize. “We’ve seen the evolution firsthand. Innovation at this level doesn’t happen overnight — it requires commitment, iteration, and a willingness to stay engaged until the value is clear. Solutions like this also require a broader cultural shift in how we approach sustainably delivered concrete.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor Revolution | London, e-HYDRIVE represents more than a product milestone — it reflects a broader commitment to advancing the industry.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“We believe meaningful innovation must solve real operational challenges while helping move the entire industry forward,” said Bob Monchamp, President, Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery. “Electrification in concrete delivery is not a distant concept — it’s happening now. Solutions like e-HYDRIVE help set the foundation for the next era of mixer technology and accelerate the next generation of sustainable concrete delivery.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nRevolution | London will showcase e-HYDRIVE at CONEXPO-CON/AGG (Booth C30220, Central Hall) beginning March 3, where attendees can learn more about how the company continues to engineer forward-looking mixer technologies built on real-world validation and performance.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery\n<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>Revolution Concrete Mixers and London Machinery Inc. represent a combined 171 years of industry and mixer-building knowledge, serving customers across the United States, Canada, and around the world.

            "title": "Canada's Economy Contracts in Fourth Quarter, Capping a Soft Year — 2nd Update",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada's economy shrank as it closed out 2025, yet still managed to show resilience against the U.S. administration's protectionist shift. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Gross domestic product declined at an annualized rate of 0.6% in the October-to-December period to 2.502 trillion Canadian dollars, the equivalent of US$1.829 trillion, Statistics Canada said Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The contraction was slightly steeper than the 0.2% economists expected following a recovery in the prior quarter. But the weakness was largely thanks to a big withdrawal from business inventories that offset growth in exports, and increases in both household and government spending. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Industry-level activity strengthened in the final month of the year, though advance data indicates a shaky start to this year and no growth as activity was likely held back by snowstorms and severe cold temperatures. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Canada was broadsided last year by President Trump's tariffs, particularly the country's trade exposed industries and sectors singled out by the White House's sectoral levies on steel, aluminum, lumber and other goods that enter the U.S. in large volumes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Over 2025, Canadian real GDP grew 1.7%, the slowest pace since a drop in 2020 during the global pandemic, largely due to a decline in exports to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Yet data for the final quarter of last year highlights continued strength at home and a recovery in exports, helped by efforts to direct shipments to markets beyond the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Final domestic demand, a gauge of spending by all sectors of the economy, grew 2.4% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter after falling 0.5% the previous quarter. Household spending rose 0.4% on a nonannualized basis after weakening slightly in the prior quarter, leaving household consumption for the year up 2.3% and in line with the 2.2% pace in each of the previous two years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Added to that was a second consecutive quarter of increased government spending and a massive increase in defense spending. Investment by Canadian businesses dipped slightly for the quarter, though there was a sharp increase in spending on machinery and equipment, primarily computers. Overall, capital investment was up in 2025 with the jump in spending on weapons systems and a slight increase in residential construction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The relatively positive composition of GDP data for the quarter is expected to allow the Bank of Canada to remain on the sidelines after keeping its policy interest rate steady twice in a row, economists said. That is despite the central bank projecting a flat fourth quarter, and the possibility the first quarter of 2026 will undershoot the 1.8% growth it most recently forecast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dominique Lapointe, director of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said that while the fourth quarter surprised to the downside there was a revision to the contraction seen in the second quarter to just 0.9% annualized from a prior estimate of 1.8%. \"From the Bank of Canada's perspective, this leaves the output gap largely unchanged, albeit negative, and doesn't open the door to additional rate cuts,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The biggest drag on GDP came from the drawdown in inventories, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  an often volatile metric, after businesses boosted stocks the previous two quarters. For the year, non-farm inventories fell for the first year since 2020, even as farm stocks rose for the first time in three years with strong crop production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The country's exports, meanwhile, were up 1.5% for the final quarter, driven by shipments of unwrought gold and of aluminum. Yet despite the recovery in the second half of 2025, exports for 2025 were down 1.7% as trade with the U.S. failed to fully recover. Imports nudged up 0.3% in the final quarter, but were down 0.4% for the year after a steep decline in the third quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected last April as a counter to President Trump, has pledged to strengthen the resilience of Canada's economy and decouple it from a dependence on its biggest trading partner. The push includes efforts by the former central banker to bring financial relief to sectors hit hardest by tariffs while pushing for a doubling of non-U.S. exports over the next decade. There are indications these efforts are bearing fruit: the U.S. has gone from being the destination for roughly 70% of Canadian exports to about 64% at the latest count. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Economists expect soft momentum in 2026 and the central bank has forecast growth will average about 1.1% for the year. A new federal groceries and essentials benefit is expected to offer a boost at mid-year with other fiscal measures, and the recovery in exports should support stronger growth in the second half, though that hinges on trade talks between with the U.S., said Michael Davenport, senior Canada economist at Oxford Economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The national data agency said industry-level GDP in December was up 0.2% from the month before, the strongest growth since September as manufacturing increased after contracting two months running. Still, the advance estimate indicates GDP was essentially unchanged in January, as increases in mining, oil and gas extraction, and finance and insurance, were offset by renewed weakness in manufacturing and real estate weakness. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.

The breakthrough technology produces hydrogen fuel onsite at 50% lower cost than any other hydrogen fuel and can be used in existing coal and gas power plants for electricity generation. \"We have fully tested the commercial ultra-high temperature pyrolysis OQR® unit for more than a year,\" said Dr. Nansen Saleri, Chairman of the Omnis Hydrogen Technology Advisory Board. \"The OQR® has been rigorously evaluated, and we are confident it can now be effectively scaled to supply hydrogen fuel for the entire plant.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">A single OQR® has demonstrated the ability to produce hydrogen from carbon fuels. However, the true breakthrough lies in the unparalleled efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proprietary process that is expected to reduce fuel costs at the 1,300MW Pleasants Power Station. When fully scaled with multiple OQR® units, Pleasants could usher in a new era of clean power generation, leveraging the state's rich hydrocarbon resources and positioning the Pleasants facility as the world's largest Hydrogen production plant.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Independent Validation<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>The groundbreaking, patented technology has been validated by numerous independent experts and industry leaders. A comprehensive third party study of the OQR® technology and operations at Pleasants Power Station, conducted over more than four months, concluded that it met all goals for safety, commercial capability, and economic viability.  Over the past year, representatives from major academic institutions, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), the Department of Energy (DOE), and many West Virginia State legislators witnessed the OQR® reforming Quantum H<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2</span>® fuel from hydrocarbon feedstock and its use at Pleasants Power Station to generate electricity for the PJM market.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Acknowledgments and Next Steps<br data-v-479a2324=\"\"/></strong>\"I am confident in the future of Quantum H<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">2</span>® as a sustainable, low-cost fuel for power generation,\" said Simon Hodson, Chairman of Quantum Pleasants, LLC. \"We are grateful to the State of West Virginia and its Economic Development Authority for providing an early-stage loan that was invaluable. The Pleasants Power Station is now on track to become a fully restored, hydrogen-powered facility that uses West Virginia coal and natural gas, employing hundreds of local residents. The socio-economic benefits to the state at full-scale operations are enormous, as it will serve as a magnet for energy-intensive businesses. We could not have achieved this so quickly without the support of the State and the local community.\"</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">With commercial validation complete, Quantum Pleasants is moving forward with plans to convert the entire power station to hydrogen fuel. The fuel conversion is expected to take approximately 24 months. Once complete, the Pleasants Power Station will be the first large power plant converted from fossil fuel to 100% hydrogen fuel. In preparation for this next phase, the company is in advanced discussions with select strategic partners to assume ownership and operation of the power plant, enabling Quantum Pleasants to focus on advancing hydrogen reformation technology for the global power market.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">About Quantum Pleasants, LLC</strong> <span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Quantum </span>Pleasants<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">, LLC is a licensee of </span>Omnis<span data-v-602de5d2=\"\"> Energy, a leading innovator in hydrogen production technology, focused on developing commercially scalable, economically viable solutions for the energy sector.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     February's anti-AI trade has been driving a dramatic rotation under the surface of the stock market. Has it gone too far already? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A rare alliance against Big Tech came together in February. Now that could be put to the test. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     February has brought a sharp rotation away from the group of megacap tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven MAGS, sparking an \"everything but tech\" rally that lifted economically sensitive names as well as recession shelters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That unusual unity, however, may already be starting to crack as the month draws to a close, suggesting the market's temporary alliance against Big Tech may not last. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In February, defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities XX:SP500.55 have surged alongside economically sensitive groups such as industrials and materials, while technology stocks XX:SP500.45 have been under sharp pressure. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This comes as concerns about tech spending and artificial intelligence were on full display this week, with the big drop in Nvidia's stock (NVDA) that followed its blowout earnings report dragging the rest of the stock market lower. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Why Nvidia's stock is falling despite a historic earnings beat </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That backdrop has led to the S&amp;P 500's SPX consumer staples XX:SP500.30, industrials XX:SP500.20 and materials XX:SP500.15 sectors being among the best-performing of the large-cap benchmark index's 11 sectors so far in February, with each up over 6.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.4% in the same period, according to FactSet data (see table below). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     SOURCE: DOW JONES MARKET DATA; FACTSET </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I don't think anybody had that on their bingo card coming into 2026,\" said Stephen Hoedt, head of equities at Key Private Bank. \"It has created a really difficult environment for market participants to navigate, because there's no playbook that you could come up with over the last 10 years where cyclicals and and defensives were rallying at the same time while tech was getting smashed.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cyclicals and defensive stocks rarely move in tandem, as they tend to benefit from different, and often opposing, market and economic conditions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Defensive stocks are shares of companies that provide essential goods and services that tend to remain in demand regardless of economic conditions. These safe-haven investments often offer low volatility and could help protect investors from market downturns, but they generally lag during bull markets. Cyclical stocks, on the other hand, are closely tied to the economic cycle. They typically perform well during expansions, but could underperform during economic downturns or even recessions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A central theme around the rapid pace of AI advancements is that it could be a driving force for growth. But it also might trigger painful job losses and render some business lines obsolete, which could ultimately hurt the consumer-centric U.S. economy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, investors have focused on the consumer staples sector, which was up a total of 14.2% in January and February, while the industrials sector rose 13% and materials stocks were up 15.7% in the year to date, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: The S&amp;P 500 is caught in an extremely narrow trading range. What's happening beneath the surface could decide where the index goes next. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More broadly, there has been a rising \"united front\" against Big Tech that has \"nothing to do with economic conditions,\" Hoedt told MarketWatch in a phone interview. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"But it has everything to do with the market looking for stuff that is not AI impacted and figuring out what is a safe place to hide. What we see here is the anti-AI trade really writ large in these sector rotations,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cyclicals may extend their leadership </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Hoedt, the correlation between cyclicals and defensive stocks is likely to break down soon, as defensive trades become crowded and expensive. Should the economy run hot, cyclical stocks could see further gains from here. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It strikes us that the defensive trade has gotten a bit overcooked and crowded. But we don't think that people are going to back off the cyclicals when we're in a hot economy, so cyclicals are the place to be in,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Economic conditions remain a wild card for the rest of 2026 as investors parse how AI will reshape the labor market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ken Mahoney, president and chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, said that cyclicals such as industrials and materials are also benefiting from the rise of \"physical AI\" as they provide support in the build-out of infrastructure, including power grids, data centers and factories, that will support the next phase of the AI race. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Technology stories are usually more exciting than the materials, but you need all these materials to get up and running for all the contracts that have been signed and construction to be done in the next few years,\" Mahoney told MarketWatch via phone on Thursday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's why the rally in materials and industrials \"still has legs,\" he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: AI jitters are turning discount chains and shampoo makers into the stock market's hottest trade - and that's risky </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stocks were lower on Friday. The Nasdaq composite COMP was down 0.8% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was 1.2% lower, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Isabel Wang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
