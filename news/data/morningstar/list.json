Typically, a stronger U.S. dollar makes U.S. grain exports less attractive for global customers versus the exports of other countries. Seemingly outweighing this uptick in the dollar is the desire of traders to get their books in order ahead of the weekend, said Brady Huck of Advance Trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Next Episode: The agricultural market is now looking past the U.S.-China deal and spent the day searching for the next major mover of futures. \"Grain action and volume slowed considerably overnight with the U.S.-China trade deal having come and gone,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases, although reports of cargoes did circulate today. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Going the Distance: Some analysts are unsure if soybean purchasing under the pending U.S.-China trade truce will take place as promised, even amid reports of Chinese buyers securing some new soybean cargoes. One reason is because there are no penalties described to enforce China's purchasing of 12 million metric tons of soybeans in this marketing year, along with 25 million tons of soybeans annually for the following three years. \"Whether China secures 25 MMTs in future years depends on the price relationships between South America and the U.S.\" AgResource said in a note. \"China buys what China needs at the cheapest price offered -- it's that simple.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dried Out: The U.S. Drought Monitor, which has remained in operation through the government shutdown, is showing dryness spread throughout the eastern Corn Belt states. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map, but also large areas of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest -- but the dryness likely hasn't helped those conditions. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Tyson Foods Co. will release its fourth quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

As Komigo moves toward a full launch, Maxfield is sharing his vision for the company and the inspiration that drives its mission.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSocial selling has grown fast, but not always simply. Many creators juggle multiple brand deals, track complex commissions, and manage fragmented systems. Komigo was built to fix that. The platform brings trusted brands, analytics, and earnings into one space, offering creators transparency and control while helping brands connect with audiences in more authentic ways.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Komigo was born from listening,” said Maxfield, Founder and CEO of Komigo. “Creators told us they wanted freedom to represent multiple brands, to understand their data, and to see their earnings clearly. Komigo is our answer to that call. It’s designed to make authenticity scalable.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nKomigo introduces a suite of tools designed to make social influence simple and sustainable. With QuickCart and QuickLinks, creators can instantly share individual products or full collections, streamlining the path from recommendation to purchase. The platform’s KomigoBox subscription feature transforms recurring engagement into predictable income, giving creators a reliable foundation for long-term growth.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nComplementing these features, Komigo’s transparent analytics provide clear visibility into performance, showing what resonates, where sales originate, and how creators can strengthen their businesses with data-driven confidence.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our goal is to redefine what social selling feels like for creators, for brands, and for customers. We want transparency, simplicity, and purpose to drive every interaction,” says Maxfield.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs Komigo expands, it plans to partner with brands across industries, from beauty and wellness to lifestyle and home products, creating an ecosystem where authenticity and commerce can grow together. The company’s broader impact lies in reshaping how creators earn and how brands connect, setting a new standard for trust, transparency, and meaningful engagement in the social commerce space.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Derek Maxfield is an entrepreneur, innovator, and philanthropist whose career spans technology, direct sales, and social impact. Over more than two decades, he has founded and guided multiple ventures that merge purpose with performance. He is the CEO of Komigo and co-founded Younique, a global beauty brand that pioneered social commerce within direct sales. Maxfield serves as a founding board member of Saprea, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting survivors of childhood sexual abuse. He brings a leadership philosophy rooted in authenticity, innovation, and impact, driving teams to build companies that do well by doing good.</em>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more news and information about Derek Maxfield, please visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fderek-maxfield-043691118&amp;esheet=54349003&amp;newsitemid=20251031916494&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fderek-maxfield-043691118&amp;index=2&amp;md5=666f38dd93c510440526dcfdc3729796\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-maxfield-043691118</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more information on Komigo, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.komigo.com%2F&amp;esheet=54349003&amp;newsitemid=20251031916494&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.komigo.com%2F&amp;index=3&amp;md5=18bae4b26718cb0ae25780fb115e752a\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.komigo.com/</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20251031916494r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\"/></picture></span><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Media Contact: </strong>Komigo Public Relations\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Phone:</strong> (435)271-9756\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Email:</strong> <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:PR@komigo.com\" tabindex=\"0\">PR@komigo.com</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251031916494/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251031916494/en/</a></span></p></div>",

In the 2024 MSSP, Aledade’s 10 CHC-only ACOs achieved over $585 in savings per beneficiary and earned a total of more than $96 million in shared savings.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAledade’s <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faledade.com%2Fchc-center-of-excellence&amp;esheet=54349080&amp;newsitemid=20251031042856&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Community+Health+Center+Center+of+Excellence&amp;index=6&amp;md5=7d502f041d37b62ff6404fff81b1551c\" tabindex=\"0\">Community Health Center Center of Excellence</a> (CoE) fosters collaboration and best practice sharing among health centers nationwide, utilizing blood pressure data insights from Aledade's proprietary platform.

Any announcements regarding Venezuela policy would come directly from the President.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, oil prices found some support in the wake of the news report of potential strikes, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery (CLZ25) (CL.1) edged up by 0.7% to settle at $60.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices still ended lower for the week and declined for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Although the U.S. already has certain sanctions on Venezuela in place, \"those do not impact physical [oil] production and transport in the same way that possible damage from military activity could,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \"So this appears to be forcing investors to adjust their supply-risk expectations.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is a \"rare occasion,\" Cieszynski noted, where \"supply risks are more focused in the Americas.\" He pointed out that U.S. crude prices traded up a bit more during Friday's session than global benchmark Brent crude. Brent's January contract (BRNF26) - which became the front month at the end of the session - moved up by 0.6% to settle at $64.77 on ICE Futures Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites would potentially pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \"This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The situation, meanwhile, could overshadow concerns about the recent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft Oil Company and Lukoil OAO, said Flynn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil traders also are anticipating the latest decision by the major oil producers known as OPEC+ over the weekend. The group plans to hold its monthly meeting on Sunday and is expected to decide on production targets for the month of December. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the last meeting in early October, OPEC+ agreed to increase production in November by another 137,000 barrels a day, despite rising concerns of a global supply glut. The group has been announcing monthly production increases since April. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In 2026, the global oil market may see an average surplus of 4 million barrels per day, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and World Bank Group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: An oil supply glut could sink prices to $35 a barrel next year. Why the U.S.-China trade truce won't change that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the short term, analysts were expecting oil officials to announce a similar rise of 137,000 barrels per day in production targets, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But long term, it looks as if the oil market wants to go lower, retesting the double bottom from this past May of $55 front-month WTI, he said in emailed comments to MarketWatch Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The reason is simply the ongoing slowdown in global demand growth, against recent reports that there will be a supply overhang of around 4 million bpd next year,\" said Morrison. \"That could be countered by U.S. sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil, but I don't think traders put much store in the effectiveness of sanctions.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some locales, like Kyoto and San Diego, are increasing the taxes they levy on visitors </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These days, local taxes can easily add more than $100 to the bill for a hotel stay - and the businesses don't even get the money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your hotel bill may soon be getting higher - and it could have nothing to do with the room rate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A number of cities are upping the taxes they levy on hotel guests. The add-on expense, sometimes referred to as a \"bed tax\" or \"tourist tax,\" can equate to hundreds of dollars in certain instances, depending on the locale and how long a guest stays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example: In Washington, D.C., the hotel tax now stands at 15.95%, following a slight increase approved by city officials in 2022 that was recently extended to September 2027. For a four-night stay at a hotel that charges $216 a night - the average daily D.C. room rate, according to CoStar, a real-estate analytics company - that comes out to $138 in bed taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But it can get more expensive in other markets: In Kyoto, one of Japan's most popular tourist destinations, a new bed-tax rate that is set to go into effect next March adds as much as $65 a night to a hotel stay. That translates into a $455 add-on for a week's visit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other municipalities that have hopped on the bed tax-hike bandwagon include San Diego (from 10.5% up to 13.75%); Aurora, Ill. (from 3% to 6%); and Oklahoma City (from 5.5% to 9.25%). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's no secret why cities levy these taxes and often opt to increase them: It's a way of raising revenue without tapping local residents for more. And the money generated, which can total millions of dollars over time, is often tied to tourism, as in marketing campaigns designed to attract visitors to the destination. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, no visitor likes paying these taxes, but cities are hopeful that the amounts will be small enough that it won't stop tourists from coming. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You don't want to discourage usage,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Holt noted that the city made sure that its bed-tax rate wouldn't be out of line compared to competing municipalities. \"We did all the research,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A similar point was raised by tourism officials with Washington, D.C., who said that the city's 15.95% bed-tax rate is still lower than or on par with a number of prominent municipalities across the country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Indeed, a 2024 study from the U.S. Travel Association, in partnership with consulting firm Civitas, found the average lodging levy to be 15.22%. That's up from 14.52% in 2018. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amanda Belarmino, a tourism expert who teaches at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's William F. Harrah College of Hospitality, said the increase in bed-tax rates may be partly due to the pandemic and the need for cities to make up for lost revenue. But she said other factors are also at play, including the aforementioned hard-to-ignore reality that it's \"more politically popular\" to stick tourists with a tax hike than locals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But will tourists push back at some point and just avoid visiting because of higher bed taxes? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We have not seen a lot of evidence of 'sticker shock' as of yet,\" Belarmino said. But she didn't rule out the possibility that some of the recent nationwide decline in tourism, especially among foreign visitors, could be attributable to traveler frustration with taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Milos Eric, co-founder of OysterLink, a hospitality-job platform, believes hotels in certain locales are definitely taking a hit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"In some of the most popular cities with the biggest taxes, we're seeing more travelers shift to alternative accommodations or to the suburbs to keep their overall price down on the stay,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another point of concern among travelers: Bed taxes are not always fully made known - at least at first glance - when looking at room rates online. That is, you might see a posted rate for the room itself, but when you go to book, you'll find the add-on expenses, which can include taxes as well as those ubiquitous resort fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It's frustrating that some platforms are fully transparent while others hide additional charges until checkout, making it hard to compare costs accurately,\" said Caroline Morse Teel, executive editor of the SmarterTravel website. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But Circle is basically a money-market fund with tech wrapping. If they're holding $500 billion to $1 trillion in Treasurys and rates move 100 basis points, that's a massive duration risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We lived through Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). I watched \"safe\" Treasury positions blow up when liquidity disappeared. Why wouldn't Circle face the same disaster if they scale to Fed infrastructure levels? Or are you assuming they'd have Fed backstop facilities similar to the discount window? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, political question: Can you imagine [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren's reaction when a private crypto company becomes systemically important to U.S. banking? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Patricia </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Patricia, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You're asking the right question, which is why you're in finance and not a crypto influencer with a YouTube channel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yes, Circle faces duration risk if it scales to the $500 billion to $1 trillion range. And yes, SVB should terrify anyone paying attention. But here's the critical difference: SVB was a bank pretending to be a tech company. Circle is a tech company that would become, if my thesis plays out, a systemically important financial institution - whether they want to or not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Circle gets Fed backstop facilities, discount-window access, FDIC insurance on USDC (or something functionally equivalent) and enough regulatory scrutiny that its compliance department becomes larger than its engineering team. It becomes a boring utility that happens to process a trillion dollars in settlements annually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Will Circle's executives like this? Probably not. Will they have a choice? No. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your political instinct is correct. Pick any regulator - they'd all lose their minds. But here's the beautiful irony: The solution to \"private crypto company becomes systemically important\" is to wrap it in so much regulation and government backstop that it becomes de facto nationalized. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Circle becomes the post office of digital money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Circle becomes the post office of digital money. Boring, essential, quasigovernmental and impossible to kill. Its executives will spend more time in Senate hearings than in board meetings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for duration risk: If Circle reaches Fed infrastructure scale and doesn't have sophisticated risk management, it deserves what happens. But unlike SVB, it won't be allowed to fail quietly. Too many banks depend on it by that point. The Fed either backs it or admits the system was always a house of cards. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I know which way I'd bet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     P.S. Somewhere in Circle's San Francisco office, there's a founder who dreamed of disrupting banking. That person is now filling out their 47th regulatory filing of the week. This is what winning looks like. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Charlie, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You explained Fed policy, made me laugh and validated my rage all in one article.

Then everyone stands around, confused about why the system doesn't work. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But distrusting the Fed and abandoning the dollar are completely different moves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your landlord doesn't accept silver. Your insurance company doesn't take bitcoin. And the IRS will hear your theory about returning to the gold standard - right before they garnish your wages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed deserves every bit of your skepticism. Your grocery bill proves it's either lying or incompetent, possibly both. But being angry at the system and having a workable alternative to the system are two completely different problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One is easy.

I agree about the T-shirt. If I make one, I'll send you the first copy. Won't fix your grocery bill, but at least you'll look good being angry about it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Charlie, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Futures prices are already anchored in the stock markets, even without the eight-hour funding rate settlement. Technically, perpetual futures should function efficiently without the need for periodic settlements or payouts every eight hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also, regarding the discussion about bank leverage, reserves, clearing and liquidity - it seems there could be a more robust approach. For instance, banks could provide security against the leverage they extend, drawing from their reserves, assets and collateral they receive from borrowers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Leverage providers could be incentivized throughout an ongoing perpetual-futures trade by receiving a nominal, dynamically adjusted fee based on the trade's duration. That would create a simpler, more transparent and self-sustaining system without generating systemic stress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Patrick </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We're stuck with eight-hour settlements because changing requires admitting we were wrong, and financial people would rather eat glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Patrick, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You've stumbled onto something embarrassing: The entire financial system is running on technology designed by people who thought eight-hour intervals were sophisticated because they could divide 24 by three. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Perpetual futures don't need eight-hour cycles. BitMEX picked eight hours in 2016 because it was tidy, not because physics demanded it. It's the QWERTY keyboard of crypto - we're stuck with it because changing requires admitting we were wrong. Financial people would rather eat glass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The funding rate simply needs to keep futures prices honest by making arbitrage attractive. DeFi protocols figured this out years ago. Perpetual Protocol does it every block - constantly funding settles in seconds. No more timing games. No more sophisticated traders opening positions after funding and closing before the next one, like teenagers sneaking home after curfew. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Why haven't Binance and Bybit adopted this? Because they're making money on the current stupidity. Never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake - especially when you're the one collecting fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now for the truly hilarious part: U.S. banks get free intraday overdrafts from the Fed. Zero cost. Just post some collateral and overdraw all you want, as long as you're square by 6 p.m. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Before 2008, banks paid market rates for intraday liquidity. This created what economists call \"discipline\" and normal people call \"not being morons.\" After 2008, the Fed decided to give away the store. Massive reserves, free overdrafts, zero price signals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The result? Banks are sitting on trillions in unproductive reserves because they have no idea what liquidity costs. Neither does anyone else. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed's own economists admit intraday credit has real value, but refuse to charge for it. It's like running a bar where the drinks are free, but you need a credit card on file. Everyone gets drunk and nobody learns anything. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your proposal - dynamic fees based on duration, real collateral, transparent pricing - isn't radical. It's how perps already work. Crypto traders in 2025 have better risk management than Bank of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Banks could do continuous settlement. They could price intraday credit dynamically. They could manage collateral instead of tracking it in Excel like it's 1987. Technology exists. What's missing is the willingness to admit that the current system is a tire fire wrapped in compliance theater. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So yes, your idea works. And yes, it'll happen. Either because banks wise up, or because the next crisis forces regulators to stop pretending that free liquidity and moral hazard are sound public policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm betting on the crisis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yours in fiscal anarchy, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     P.S. The really depressing part? Someone at the Fed likely has already written a paper explaining all of this. It's sitting in a drawer somewhere, gathering dust next to the report about how maybe we shouldn't have bailed out everyone in 2008. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Charlie Garcia is founder and a managing partner of R360, a peer-to-peer organization for individuals and families with a net worth of $100 million or more. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Agree?
