Together, we are delivering a scalable, 24/7 patient acquisition and conversion engine that modernizes access for DSOs while reducing operational strain.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe partnership is designed to support DSOs seeking to modernize patient access, standardize scheduling workflows, improve after-hours responsiveness, and reduce front-desk staffing pressure. Voicify’s platform integrates directly with leading dental practice management systems, enabling real-time appointment booking and automated patient communications across multi-location deployments. Dental.com and Voicify also plan to collaborate on additional go-to-market initiatives and expanded integration opportunities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAbout Dental.com / Virtual Dental Care\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDental.com, powered by Virtual Dental Care, Inc., provides virtual-first access to dental care through licensed dentist consultations, AI-powered oral health assessments, and care navigation tools designed to improve access, convenience, and continuity of care.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAbout Voicify\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nVoicify is a voice AI platform built for multi-location dental practices and DSOs, functioning as an AI dental receptionist that answers inbound calls, schedules, reschedules, and cancels appointments, and executes outbound appointment confirmations, reminders, and recall campaigns.

The movement higher doesn't appear supported by fundamentals, said Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note. \"We are still looking for that elusive fundamental reason why wheat is hanging in around its highs after a 49-cent rally since the beginning of the calendar year,\" says Sernatinger. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Summit Squabble: A story from the South China Morning Post said the potential summit between President Trump and Chinese president Xi is experiencing issues, which the story attributes to \"planning gaps and weak coordination on the U.S. side.\" The story was a pressure point for soybeans Thursday,  as well as livestock futures, due to the export demand from those products coming from China. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Always in the Background: Analysts are keeping a close eye on how the Brazilian harvest is progressing, and preparing for the surge of Brazilian soybeans hitting the global export market. The record amount of soybeans expected from Brazil may create a short-term ceiling for prices. \"It would be unusual for the biggest soybean harvest the world has ever seen (Brazil) to not slow down price gains in the beans at some point,\" said Doug Bergman of RCM Alternatives in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Missing the Mark: Export sales of U.S. corn fell below the expectations of analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this week. The USDA said Thursday that corn export sales across the 2025/26 and 2026/27 marketing years totaled 697,500 metric tons for the week ended Feb. 19. Analysts had forecast sales to land between 900,000 tons and 1.8 million tons. Soybean and wheat sales landed on the low end of analyst expectations for the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  New Sale: The USDA said this morning that 178,000 metric tons of corn were sold to Japan, with 154,000 tons for delivery during the 2026/2027 marketing year and an additional 24,000 tons for 2027/28 delivery. While the market welcomes flash sales, Thursday's notice isn't the one many traders were hoping to see -  that would be a sale of soybeans to China, which was rumored among market participants this week. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Agricultural Prices report at 3 p.m. ET Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The CFTC will release its weekly Commitment of Traders report at 3:30 p.m. ET Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its weekly Grain Export Inspections report at 11 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Grain Crushings report at 3 p.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 15:25 ET (20:25 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

Utilizing end-to-end edge computing technology, Toshiba's solution also minimizes the risk of shrink, builds shopper trust, and enhances checkout speed for a seamless and enjoyable self-service experience.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe 27 locations participating in the pilot are already generating measurable benefits in customer satisfaction and store productivity. Stores are reporting a 50% - 70% increase in self-checkout transactions. A defining feature of ELERA® Security Suite that is critical for the retailer includes accurately recognizing over 700 unique produce codes and a wide assortment of fresh produce. The solution is also reducing staff self-checkout intervention rates from 50% to about 10%—20%. By spending less time at self-checkout, employees are empowered to focus on higher-value responsibilities around the store.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“The self-checkout improvements provided by Toshiba and ELERA® Security Suite are especially significant on high-traffic days when produce promotions attract more shoppers. My team and I can provide better customer service when we can work efficiently and with less stress during peak hours,” said Adriana Correa, Store Manager at Hipermarket El Dorado, a chain under Group El Rosado. “When fewer team members are at self-checkout, our staff can focus on other operational tasks and increase overall productivity across the store.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWith the rollout completed in less than four months, the rapid successful pilot implementation is a testament to the strong collaboration between Grupo El Rosado, Toshiba, and valued partners. <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compuhelp.com.ec%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=COMPUHELP&amp;index=5&amp;md5=89993f28afd40b7a9d421495b611cb16\" tabindex=\"0\">COMPUHELP</a> performed the installation, and systems integrator <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F33sur.cl%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=33%26%23176%3B+Sur&amp;index=6&amp;md5=fe0ddf1a73599fff108b002e7ad77f17\" tabindex=\"0\">33° Sur</a> was responsible for the seamless implementation.
