This release contains forward-looking information about, among other topics, Pfizer’s proposed acquisition of Metsera that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks and uncertainties related to the impact of Novo Nordisk’s proposal on the proposed acquisition; risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing the proposed acquisition (including the failure to obtain the requisite vote by Metsera stockholders) in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including the possibility that the proposed acquisition does not close; the possibility that competing offers may be made or accepted; the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated; risks related to the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including Metsera’s ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and other clinical and scientific personals; negative effects of this announcement or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on the market price of Pfizer’s or Metsera’s common stock and/or operating results; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed acquisition or Metsera’s business; other business effects and uncertainties, including the effects of industry, market, business, economic, political or regulatory conditions;

the uncertainties inherent in business and financial planning, including, without limitation, risks related to Pfizer’s business and prospects, adverse developments in Pfizer’s markets, or adverse developments in the U.S. or global capital markets, credit markets, regulatory environment, tariffs and other trade policies or economies generally; future business combinations or disposals; uncertainties regarding the commercial success of Metsera’s pipeline products or Pfizer’s commercialized and/or pipeline products; risks associated with Metsera conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies outside of the United States; Metsera’s reliance on third parties to conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies and for the manufacture and shipping of its product candidates; the risk that Metsera’s product candidates are associated with side effects, adverse events or other properties or safety risks; risks associated with Metsera’s license and collaboration agreements and future strategic alliances; Metsera’s ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patent or other intellectual property protection for current or future product candidates or technology;

risks associated with initial, preliminary or interim data; the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from the clinical studies; whether and when drug applications may be filed in any jurisdictions for Pfizer’s or Metsera’s pipeline products for any potential indications; whether and when any such applications may be approved by regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the product's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the product's efficacy and, if approved, whether any such products will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such products; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19;

(Patria Re) (Mexico). AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” (Good) of Patria Re’s ultimate parent, Peña Verde, S.A.B. (Peña Verde) (Mexico). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Per AM Best’s criteria procedure on insurance holding companies, Peña Verde’s rating reflects a standard notching from Patria Re’s Long-Term ICR.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Patria Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe stable outlooks reflect Patria Re’s ability to maintain a stable and profitable operation along with a strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), while implementing its business expansion strategy.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re is Mexico's only locally registered reinsurer, founded in 1953. The company has a strong niche position in Mexico and in other Latin America markets, which allows it to accept profitable business selectively while maintaining a diversified product portfolio tailored to specific markets, where it has developed very strong client relationships. This strategy has resulted in consistently favorable underwriting results over the past few years.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re’s balance sheet strength assessment of strongest is supported by that same assessment on the company’s level of risk-adjusted capitalization, low underwriting leverage, a robust reinsurance program placed among counterparties with a strong security level and strong liquidity metrics. The ratings also reflect its comprehensive ERM infrastructure and expansive knowledge of its core markets in Latin America, which reflects the company’s smooth implementation of its expansion strategy with a stable overseas operation outside its niche market.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDespite limitations posted by catastrophe reserve development, Patria Re reported positive bottom-line results in 2024, mainly driven by favorable underwriting results. The company’s strong underwriting practices allowed Patria Re to report a bottom-line result of MXN 1 billion. The company’s efforts to maintain stable claims and management expenses have resulted in a profitable first six months for 2025, with a bottom-line of MXN 347 million, despite the limitations of catastrophe reserve development.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFactors that could lead to positive rating actions for the company include a consistent upward trend in profitability metrics that compare well with the strong operating performance, while maintaining its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as well as the continued and successful operation of its overseas expansion. Factors that may lead to negative rating actions include a sustained deterioration in risk-adjusted capitalization, driven either by unfavorable results or a significant cash withdrawal.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Typically, a stronger U.S. dollar makes U.S. grain exports less attractive for global customers versus the exports of other countries. Seemingly outweighing this uptick in the dollar is the desire of traders to get their books in order ahead of the weekend, said Brady Huck of Advance Trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Next Episode: The agricultural market is now looking past the U.S.-China deal and spent the day searching for the next major mover of futures. \"Grain action and volume slowed considerably overnight with the U.S.-China trade deal having come and gone,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases, although reports of cargoes did circulate today. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Going the Distance: Some analysts are unsure if soybean purchasing under the pending U.S.-China trade truce will take place as promised, even amid reports of Chinese buyers securing some new soybean cargoes. One reason is because there are no penalties described to enforce China's purchasing of 12 million metric tons of soybeans in this marketing year, along with 25 million tons of soybeans annually for the following three years. \"Whether China secures 25 MMTs in future years depends on the price relationships between South America and the U.S.\" AgResource said in a note. \"China buys what China needs at the cheapest price offered -- it's that simple.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dried Out: The U.S. Drought Monitor, which has remained in operation through the government shutdown, is showing dryness spread throughout the eastern Corn Belt states. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map, but also large areas of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest -- but the dryness likely hasn't helped those conditions. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Tyson Foods Co. will release its fourth quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

Many creators juggle multiple brand deals, track complex commissions, and manage fragmented systems. Komigo was built to fix that. The platform brings trusted brands, analytics, and earnings into one space, offering creators transparency and control while helping brands connect with audiences in more authentic ways.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Komigo was born from listening,” said Maxfield, Founder and CEO of Komigo. “Creators told us they wanted freedom to represent multiple brands, to understand their data, and to see their earnings clearly. Komigo is our answer to that call. It’s designed to make authenticity scalable.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nKomigo introduces a suite of tools designed to make social influence simple and sustainable. With QuickCart and QuickLinks, creators can instantly share individual products or full collections, streamlining the path from recommendation to purchase. The platform’s KomigoBox subscription feature transforms recurring engagement into predictable income, giving creators a reliable foundation for long-term growth.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nComplementing these features, Komigo’s transparent analytics provide clear visibility into performance, showing what resonates, where sales originate, and how creators can strengthen their businesses with data-driven confidence.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our goal is to redefine what social selling feels like for creators, for brands, and for customers. We want transparency, simplicity, and purpose to drive every interaction,” says Maxfield.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs Komigo expands, it plans to partner with brands across industries, from beauty and wellness to lifestyle and home products, creating an ecosystem where authenticity and commerce can grow together. The company’s broader impact lies in reshaping how creators earn and how brands connect, setting a new standard for trust, transparency, and meaningful engagement in the social commerce space.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Derek Maxfield is an entrepreneur, innovator, and philanthropist whose career spans technology, direct sales, and social impact.

As a public benefit corporation, this work is at the heart of our efforts to deliver better health, better care and lower costs, creating a health care system that is good for patients, primary care practices and society as a whole.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nIn the 2024 Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), Aledade Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) saved Medicare $1 billion by delivering proactive, preventive care.

Aledade partners achieve these results through a comprehensive approach that combines innovative data dashboards, expert hypertension consulting, nurse-led remote patient monitoring and targeted patient outreach to optimize care delivery and engage patients in their care.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Community Health Centers Excel at Blood Pressure Control</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSixty of the 90 recognized Aledade partners are Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) or community health centers (CHCs). FQHCs serve medically under-resourced areas, including rural areas and populations, and provide primary care services regardless of the individual’s ability to pay. In the 2024 MSSP, Aledade’s 10 CHC-only ACOs achieved over $585 in savings per beneficiary and earned a total of more than $96 million in shared savings.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAledade’s <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faledade.com%2Fchc-center-of-excellence&amp;esheet=54349080&amp;newsitemid=20251031042856&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Community+Health+Center+Center+of+Excellence&amp;index=6&amp;md5=7d502f041d37b62ff6404fff81b1551c\" tabindex=\"0\">Community Health Center Center of Excellence</a> (CoE) fosters collaboration and best practice sharing among health centers nationwide, utilizing blood pressure data insights from Aledade's proprietary platform.
