It's exciting and, yes, nerve-racking. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One septuagenarian Moneyist reader is feeling rattled: \"I have quite a bit of money in a mutual fund, which has done well due to the amount of tech stocks and others that have appreciated quite a lot,\" he wrote. \"This fund is not in a retirement account. I fear a significant decline in the S&amp;P 500.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I have a considerable amount of unrealized capital gains in this fund and can't decide whether selling some or all of it and paying the taxes makes sense, or if I should wait through the coming decline. I am 78 and retired. My wife and I have an income of $200,000 due to IRA withdrawals.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A word of caution for him and everyone else: If you have $100,000 or $1 million in your tech-heavy mutual fund, you are sitting pretty. It will receive a step-up in basis as an inheritance. With IRA withdrawals and Social Security, this man is enjoying some well-earned gravy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors should not make decisions about their portfolio based on a feared downturn in the S&amp;P 500 SPX. You will see arguments for and against whether there is a big correction ahead. Instead, adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adjust your risk profile for your age and tolerance, and plan your legacy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All that tech money won't do you much good sitting in your bank account. Focusing on an event that may or may not happen will distort your perspective and merely create fear. That's never a good emotion on which to buy or sell stocks, or any other asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This reader is not the only one concerned about how the artificial-intelligence gold rush has caused the market to reach record highs. The tech sector, which makes up over a third of the S&amp;P 500, is still profitable, even if many companies are burning large amounts of cash on AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla continue to rise, even if it has not always been a smooth road. Tesla (TSLA) sales have slowed down in China and Europe, and the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Apple and Meta (META) all reported quarterly results this week, giving analysts an opportunity to quiz management about their ability to justify their AI spending and the valuations that, for some, look stretched. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'A friend calls it the everything bubble': Why do so many economists fear a 1929-style crash? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Streamlining retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's never a dull moment. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. President Donald Trump told reporters that he will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, Amazon, whose stock performance has mostly trailed behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts, reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations with an acceleration in its cloud-computing business. It also raised its capital expenditure guidance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon (AMZN), the country's second-largest private employer after Walmart (WMT), also said Tuesday that it's cutting 14,000 jobs as it restructures its workforce. The company has also invested billions in AI chips, and other streamlining technology. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apple (AAPL) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations. CEO Tim Cook expects the iPhone 17 will make December's quarter the \"best ever.\" Alphabet's(GOOGL) (GOOG) third-quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street's expectations, also helped by AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meta's relatively strong third-quarter earnings, released Wednesday, were overshadowed by its AI spending. Microsoft, on the same day, posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings; investors similarly expressed surprise by how much Microsoft spent on chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many investors have benefited from tech stocks as if they were a separate asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What does that tell us? Share prices rise and fall based on fundamentals, but they also move in accordance with expectations, which can also change like the weather. Even these formerly \"sleepy\" tech stocks are having their moment as they benefit from the AI boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the tech-stock wave, many people have benefited from that sector as if it were a separate asset class. In fact, given the size of Nvidia and the more than 50% rise in its stock so far this year, that may or may not add to people's worries about an AI bubble. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're near retirement and not using your mutual fund as income, you can afford another April-style correction. Believe me, many investors had the same concerns in April as the Moneyist reader, and wrote to this column about their desire to liquidate their stocks and invest in gold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average market correction (a 10% decline from a recent peak) lasts 115 days, according to Yardeni Research, a consulting firm. Although nearly half of the years since 1980 have had a correction, Fidelity says the average annual return over the same period has exceeded 13%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     According to Fidelity, the \"seven-year rule\" states that you should only invest money in the market that you don't expect to need for at least seven years. \"It will also help you to avoid having to liquidate your holdings prematurely, which may cause you to buy high and sell low,\" it says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I'm confused!' Why does President Trump want a rate cut so badly? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Reacting to market trends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve made a 25 basis point cut Wednesday, bringing the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in 3 years. It's caught between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (the labor market). Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Open Market Committee did not commit to a December rate cut: \"Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,\" it said. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Analysts are closely watching Trump's tariff negotiations, the jobs market, the Fed and inflation, but they are stymied by delayed economic data due to the government shutdown. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, is one such observer. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Markets closely watch Fed interest-rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs,\" he said. \"President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed's reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Caution favors those who don't have a clear view in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He, too, suggests staying the course, rather than reacting to market and economic trends, even in the face of a correction. \"The current market environment reflects lessons from history - stay invested and diversified - despite market volatility and uncertainty,\" Freedman said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Becoming fixated on your tech stocks could lead you to make a rash decision. It's a busy week, for sure, but sometimes the best thing we can all do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's why observers liken the market to a roller coaster. It's a well-worn, if hyperbolic, cliche. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So what about streamlining your own finances? Talk to a financial adviser, obviously, but always consider your asset allocation based on your age. How much of your wealth is in stocks versus bonds, cash and cash equivalents? Do you have children who might appreciate an inheritance? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bigger picture will inform the Moneyist reader's views about his portfolio allocation at 78. The rule of 110 - your age minus 110 - would suggest that he should have 32% of his portfolio in stocks. Given his exposure to tech, he's likely glad that it's more like the other way around. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trying to time the market, as always, is a fool's game. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I think we've been lied to': What's considered rich in America? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

The AI connectivity trade is due for more attention. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Advanced AI models need to transmit increasing amounts of information across clusters of thousands of chips, pushing traditional copper connectivity cables to their limits. A new generation of AI chips is forcing a non-negotiable and massively expensive upgrade from copper to optical technology. Further innovations will be needed to develop AI at the edge - referring to devices such as wearables, cars and robots which must be able to process data and make intelligent decisions locally, without relying on a central data center </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) recent partnership with Nokia Corp. (NOK) highlights how connectivity has become a bottleneck for AI. During its Tuesday GPU Technology Conference in Washington, Nvidia announced a $1 billion stake in Nokia as part of a strategic agreement to advance AI networking initiatives. The companies will aim to develop and commercialize 6G technology that integrates AI with the existing radio access network. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a note earlier this week, Mizuho trading-desk analyst Jordan Klein called optical-networking stocks \"the least understood and probably least owned by retail investors\" compared with memory, power and semiconductor names.

Most have outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which was up 17.2% (with dividends reinvested) for the same period. The combination of high valuation ratios and such strong recent performance underscores the importance of doing your own research and taking a long-term approach if you consider investing in growth stocks several years into a bull market, especially for AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But when thinking broadly, \"all of these players are going to benefit\" from the connectivity boom, Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at technology supplier Circular Technology, told MarketWatch. Gastwirth predicts the optical-component market will grow more than 50% year over year in 2025 and continue the momentum into 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some of these names, such as Astera Labs, Credo, Macom and Semtech, produce semiconductors that enable high-speed data transmission over fiber optics. Companies like Lumentum and Coherent build optical modules, which are the components that create and receive the light signals for fiber-optic communication. These modules are essential because light travels faster and more efficiently than electricity over copper wires. Fabrinet assembles and packages these optical components so they can be installed in high-performance routing and switching equipment from Arista and Ciena that is designed to manage data transfers and traffic across networks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When an AI server needs to send data from a graphics processing unit, light signals travel from switch to switch on specialty cables manufactured by Amphenol. Inside the switches, optical modules transform the light pulses into an electrical signal so chips can boost the strength and quality. The electrical signal is then converted back into light and travels toward another switch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Data centers need low latency and high-density bandwidth density,\" Gastwirth said, referring to fiber-optic technology's ability to transmit data faster and in greater quantities. \"You just need faster pipes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The volatility in these companies come from the boom-bust nature of the overall industry, which is characterized by customer concentration, constant technology updates and shifting supply-and-demand dynamics, according to Gastwirth. It's difficult for companies to maintain sustainably high margins, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, Gastwirth anticipates that connectivity solutions will remain undersupplied in the near future, providing these companies with a boost. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's certainly not alone in thinking this. Last month, Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton got more optimistic about shares of Credo and Semtech. Credo's next-generation chips have demonstrated significant power advantages over competitors, Bolton wrote. And he added that Semtech is well positioned for the initial ramp of Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) (GOOGL) tensor processing units. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I don't think we're anywhere near an overproduction,\" Gastwirth said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: 5 bubble-resistant tech stocks to guard your portfolio from an AI crash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Christine Ji -Philip van Doorn </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Morey Stettner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Taxes, investments, healthcare - everything adds up. Here's how to plan now to relocate later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Start early in figuring out where in the world to go. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The financial planning strategies you followed in America may no longer work as intended after you relocate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you decide to retire abroad, impulsivity works against you. Abruptly uprooting your life can expose you to financial (and emotional) shocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's better to plan ahead. \"People underestimate all the pieces that come into play,\" said Brett Bernstein, a certified financial planner in Bethesda, Md. \"The goal is to make sure they have the income they want to live off of.\" That takes months, even years, of research and preparation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Start early in figuring out where to go. Visit your top-tier destinations and consider the impact of inflation and taxes in those countries. \"Identify the income-tax rules in the country and in the local province where you might move,\" Bernstein said. \"What's the local sales tax? What other taxes are there?\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     From his experience advising clients who retire abroad, some Americans assume \"it'll be cheaper to live over there.\" The figure they can sell their U.S. house at a big profit, rent abroad and live happily ever after. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The challenge is accurately projecting the cost of living, especially nondiscretionary expenses (rent, taxes, insurance, etc.) in a new home. Advisers often use financial-planning software to map out scenarios that include currency swings, taxes and investment options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     After deciding on a foreign destination, it's best to hire an international-tax adviser who specializes in tax laws in that country. Relocation consultants or attorneys can also help anticipate and address legal and logistical issues. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Portfolio shifts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Managing long-term currency risk plays a key role. Unfavorable exchange rates can erode spending power in the years after a move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Similarly, it's good to diversify investment portfolios to include stocks and bonds issued in the future home country. That's vital if it's a permanent move. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Having international diversification in place is important,\" said Shane Cummings, a Denver-based certified financial planner. \"Beyond that, the most important thing you can do before moving abroad is to look into tax implications because [foreign] tax treaties can be complex. On the investment side, portfolio income can be taxed differently and that can lead you to make investment changes now.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Financial-planning strategies that worked in America may no longer work as intended after relocation. For example, some countries tax distributions from a Roth IRA - as well as taxing other sources of income from the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While planning well in advance of a move makes sense, risks abound. A stable country can be rocked by political instability. American retirees can quickly find themselves on the outside looking in. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Don't assume today's dream destination will welcome Americans well into the future,\" said David A. Schneider, a New York City-based certified financial planner. \"There's a risk of backlash if lots of Americans stream into that country.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spain and Portugal, for instance, remain popular choices for American retirees. But their residency and language requirements are tightening up, along with property-investment restrictions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It may be necessary to sever ties to well-liked financial advisers or brokerage accounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you become a permanent resident abroad, you'll need to find new financial [institutions] to work with you because the U.S. financial system will largely be cut off from you, even if the country is a strong U.S. ally,\" Schneider said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. financial custodians, such as banks and brokerages, have strict rules about continuing to serve Americans who relocate abroad. Increasingly, they are terminating accounts once they learn an American customer has left the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Your ability to invest in the U.S. can end without a legal U.S. address,\" said Mike Delgass, a New York City-based adviser. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare concerns </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n      If you move abroad, you will lose almost all your Medicare coverage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Healthcare is another factor that can affect a retiree's nest egg. Retirees abroad will lose almost all Medicare coverage. \"So you need to figure out how you'll fund healthcare in that country,\" Delgass said. \"It's a new expense for retirees to plan for. You may need private-pay or supplemental [health] insurance. Some countries subsidize it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And for those indecisive or prone to changing minds at the last minute, retiring abroad gets tougher and potentially more costly. Laying the groundwork methodically - researching costs and benefits and enlisting experts to ease the transition - works better for those sure they have found the right spot to retire. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Said Delgass: \"The worst thing is to do a ton of financial planning and then choose the wrong place.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: You can find quality, affordable healthcare if you retire abroad. Here's where to look. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: U.S. passport power plunges - and 'worried' Americans are searching for second passports and golden visas </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Morey Stettner </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'I saw her transfer $150 after we were done shopping' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"When she was married, she had just a cursory participation in their married finances.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I started dating a widow in her late 40s who pays by credit card but immediately transfers the purchase amount to pay off her card, instead of waiting until the end of the month to pay off her balance. When she was married, she had just a cursory participation in their married finances, but had to assume it all upon the husband's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     She said that it was easier for her to budget and not lose track of what she had spent. As long as her current cash balance was a certain level, she didn't care how much she spent above that level. I saw her transfer $150 after we were done shopping. Then she transferred $35 after her dinner bill. I'm sure after she got home by taxi she transferred the cab fare. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Have you heard of anyone who does this? It's only at most a 30-day difference so I'm not sure there is much advantage, but maybe I'm missing something besides her comfort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Credit-Card User </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I received an inheritance from my father's estate, but the executor wants me to give it back. What should I do? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm a little fazed by the scrutiny she is being subjected to for such seemingly diligent practice. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Credit-Card User, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your interest in your girlfriend's credit-card habits is intriguing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I'm torn. On the one hand, it's good that you're taking an interest in her financial behavior and habits and want to help her. On other hand, I'm a little fazed by the scrutiny she is being subjected to for such seemingly diligent practice (but only a little). It would be a lot worse if she was spending recklessly, racking up debt on her credit cards and not paying them off every month. Paying off her cards on an almost daily basis is unusual, granted, but not of immediate cause for concern. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There is a possible downside to your girlfriend's regular and meticulous credit-card payments: By paying off her balance every day, she is reducing her credit-utilization ratio to virtually zero. Having a low but healthy credit-utilization ratio - say, 10%, but below 30% - shows the credit bureaus that you are using your credit card responsibly. Your girlfriend may be showing up with a 1% or 0% credit-utiltization ratio, and thereby depriving the credit bureau of seeing her regular spending habits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some people wash dishes as they cook; others pay off their credit cards after every transaction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The other snag: If you're paying off your credit card every day, you may risk losing track of how much you spend. All of your transactions will, of course, show up, but your statement balance will likely be a big fat zero. How many times would you have to go through your bank balance to get an accurate sense of how much you have spent every month, if you did not have a starting and ending balance every month or quarter? Credit cards earn points and boost your credit score, if used correctly. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some people wash dishes as they cook; others pay off their credit cards after every transaction. She's not alone. As one member of the Moneyist Facebook group writes: \"I choose to get an alert from my credit cards whenever the balance is over $X and make a payment then. I also have a calendar reminder to make a payment just before the due date. Typically, I end up making two payments a month. As a backup/failsafe, I have an automatic payment set up for the statement balance on the due date.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I'm stumped': I put $3,000 on my credit card during a vacation and my credit score plunged. Why is it so volatile? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The main credit bureaus - Equifax (EFX), Transunion (TRU) and Experian (UK:EXPN) (EXPGY)) - don't calculate their scores in exactly the same way, so people's scores are typically dinged at different times and for slightly different reasons depending on the bureau. For instance, a FICO (FICO) score has five categories: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and credit mix (10%).

However, he has early-onset dementia, which has turned our lives upside down. I am in my mid-60s, at retirement age now, but I plan to work much longer. The property can make income too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is our second marriage. Luckily, I did not mix our finances. He was self-employed and had this 10-acre home for 30 years. We almost lost everything when he got sick. He was $20,000 behind in the mortgage. We have to refinance next year and pay his business debts off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I increased my income. I got caught up on the mortgage and I am making all the household bills. I have gotten our living expenses as low as I can, and I have dental and healthcare insurance for both of us. I plan on working for many more years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The cheapest route is to keep the property and refinance next year. There is a lot of equity. Do I ask for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage when we refinance? We plan on keeping the property in the family with help from them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     We do have a will and are securing everything to protect us. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Second Wife </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My boyfriend, 69, moved in. He refuses to pay more than $1,300 in rent and won't do yard work.

You increased your income, and you are doing what you need to do to get yourselves back in the black after your husband's business started to lose money. You are using the one asset he has to pay off his debts, and you're doing so with the cooperation and assistance of his family. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Whether or not you decide to go for a 10-, 15- or 30-year mortgage depends a) on the interest rate and b) on your husband and his estate's ability to pay off this loan. There may come a time where you will need to sell this house to pay for care when his dementia progresses, but you can only ever do one thing, one day at a time. He is fortunate to have you at his side. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other long-term plans you can make. Your husband would do well to sign a power-of-attorney document while he is of sound mind and has the legal capacity to do so, if he has not done so already. The power of attorney should be \"durable\" and should specify that you will make decisions on his behalf when he is incapacitated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He can also assign you to hold power of attorney for healthcare decisions. This will ensure that he has someone to act on his behalf in a medical context. If he does not wish to be on life support, for example, this advanced healthcare directive would say so. A living will and/or living trust can also provide additional instructions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: My husband has dementia and will need care. Will Medicaid go after my money if I use it to pay off our mortgage? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Importantly, setting up a trust would help your husband's executor - that is, you - to avoid probate. Making sure you have these documents in place before he enters mid- or late-stage dementia will prevent complications later on, like having to apply to be his guardian or conservator, which can be a lengthy and complicated process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This is also the time to look into Social Security benefits for your husband. \"Someone with early-onset Alzheimer's who is younger than 65 can qualify for fast-track eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits,\" according to AARP. \"After two years of receiving SSDI benefits, they can qualify for Medicare before age 65.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your husband could also purchase a private supplemental policy, Medigap, or look into a Medicare Advantage plan. \"Medicare will cover hospice care, which provides as much comfort as possible to terminally ill patients in the last days or months of life,\" AARP notes. \"A doctor must certify that they have a life expectancy of six months or less.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most of all, what you have created for yourselves after this diagnosis is something that was taken from you at that time: certainty. You may not know exactly how much time it will take for your husband's dementia to progress to the stage where he will need full-time care, but you have put in place enough financial safeguards to protect you both when you get there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: 'I am highly alarmed by the proposed changes to retirement accounts': I don't want bitcoin or private equity in my 401(k).

Changes to the Fed's balance sheet impact the plumbing of the financial system in a way that most investors aren't likely to notice unless something breaks down. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The decision to bring the program to an end came ahead of the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding announcement next week. That matters to investors for a number of reasons. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One reason is that it could prompt market participants to shift into areas of the financial market such as stocks and short-term funding markets, helping to ease liquidity strains in the latter, according to FHN Financial macro strategist Will Compernolle in Chicago. Another reason is that it gives the U.S. Treasury a greater ability to build up the cash balance in its general account and to fund operations, he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     All that ideally helps the federal government and the plumbing of the financial system run more smoothly, without throwing a wrench in markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With the Fed no longer reducing its aggregate securities holdings as of Dec. 1, it stops draining liquidity from the financial system and instead reinvests proceeds from maturing securities, effectively injecting them back into the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of note, the central bank said on Wednesday that it would be reinvesting all principal payments from its holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills, as well as rolling over at auction all principal payments from its holdings of Treasurys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed buying bills </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"When the Fed's balance-sheet shrinkage is happening, securities are maturing that need to be absorbed by the private market. When the Fed stops that process, the market doesn't have to absorb securities at the same pace, and private-market investments can go to other areas such as risk assets and short-term overnight funding markets,\" Compernolle said via phone on Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wrapped up in all of this is the Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement next week. \"The Treasury forms estimates for how much cash it wants in its general account, and it now has more wiggle room to build up its cash balance since it will no longer be competing with the Fed for investors' funds as of the end of the year, especially in Treasury bills,\" the strategist said. In addition, the Fed is going to become a \"willing buyer, soaking up some of the demand for T-bills.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed's balance sheet grew to a nearly $9 trillion pandemic-era peak as of mid-2022, after the central bank bought big chunks of long-duration mortgage-backed securities and Treasurys to help lower long-term interest rates, make it cheaper to borrow and stimulate demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The central bank then began shrinking its gargantuan balance sheet in June 2022 through a process known as quantitative tightening to combat high inflation and tighten financial conditions. The Fed's QT efforts were a significant factor that contributed to a decline in U.S. stock prices that year and significant losses in the bond market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While 2022 was a historically bad year for both stocks and bonds, this year is different, with the U.S. equity market repeatedly reaching fresh record highs and Treasury-market volatility falling to the lowest levels since late 2021. The end of QT in December should theoretically create an environment that supports equities, by improving overall market liquidity and lowering long-term Treasury yields. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For every dollar of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities that the Fed rolled off its balance sheet, that was a dollar of government-backed bonds that private investors would have had to purchase,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"So now that the Fed is no longer reducing its bond holdings, more of that private investment flow will go into assets that fuel the economy.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The end of QT could \"translate into more liquidity for financial markets and more private investment funds going into risky assets over a period of time,\" Adams added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yields are rising, not falling </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, long-term Treasury yields keep climbing despite the Fed's quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday, after Powell pointed to \"strongly differing views\" among policymakers about what they will do in December. That may not be music to the ears of the White House, which has been vocal about wanting to see lower mortgage rates to help boost the stalled housing market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: This long-shot move could get the 30-year mortgage rate to 5% next year, says BofA Global </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equity markets ended October's final trading session on a solid note, with investors appearing to be encouraged by the latest corporate earnings results. All three major stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP closed higher for the day, the week and the month. Treasury yields finished little changed on Friday; for the week, however, 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y rose by 10.4 basis points and 8.3 basis points, respectively, to three-week highs of 4.1% and almost 4.7%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     De facto rate cut? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Even if the Fed skips a December rate cut, the end of QT ahead of 2026 could give investors what is essentially the equivalent of a quarter-point rate cut anyway, according to John Luke Tyner, a portfolio manager at Alabama-based Aptus Capital Advisors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"It certainly should help alleviate some of the plumbing pressures with bank reserves, as well as continue to manage the supply and, more importantly, the duration of the Treasury issuance,\" Tyner said in an email to MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Not everyone agrees with such a direct comparison, however. Economist Derek Tang of Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington sees things differently. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The end of QT compounds the impact of any rate cut by \"reinforcing a lot of the risk appetite in equities,\" Tang said via phone. \"Now that the end of QT is guaranteed, we have certainty.\" But he regards the Fed's decision as more of an \"incremental change\" in the Fed's balance-sheet policy, since it simply moved the plan forward by about three to six months, relative to what market participants had expected in September. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, the end of QT will likely have an impact on the Treasury Department's Nov. 5 quarterly refunding announcement because it could influence how much the government thinks it can issue in short-term T-bills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tang said the Treasury \"will probably take into account what the Fed is thinking and start asking questions like, 'Can we issue more bills because the Fed is willing to absorb more of them?'\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Separately, T-bill-hungry money-market funds reached a record $7.42 trillion in assets for the week that ended on Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute. This record is a reflection of the demand that exists for Treasury bills, and supports the idea that the Treasury Department has more \"wiggle room\" to build up its cash balance by borrowing from investors, Compernolle said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
