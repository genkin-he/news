Dr. Zeng presents these approaches as complementary tools that can support children experiencing stress, anxiety, or depression, while emphasizing the importance of understanding root causes rather than only symptoms. Her message offers guidance not just for parents, but also for educators and caregivers seeking compassionate, grounded ways to support emotional health.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Dr. Zeng's work consistently connects personal experience with professional expertise. Born into generations of herbalists and trained as a medical researcher, she has dedicated her career to exploring how ancient healing traditions and modern science can work together to support both physical and mental health. Through her TEDx talk, she brings that philosophy into a broader conversation around parenting, resilience, and emotional care.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">The talk has resonated strongly with viewers seeking alternatives and additional perspectives in conversations around children's mental health.

This is standard procedure to detect any alleged money laundering; it does not mean that you have done anything wrong, as long as you haven't - well - done anything wrong.

That's \"structuring\" and it's illegal. This occurs if you deliberately break up financial transactions to avoid triggering mandatory reports required by law. Authorities can spot structured transactions during a Bank Secrecy Act audit, a Form 8300 review or an income-tax audit. While there are similarities between transactions designed to avoid different reporting requirements, investigators will look at them with a fine-tooth comb. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You could be asked for probate documents, a letter from the executor and/or a death certificate to confirm this cash is from a legal source. However, that would be less likely if the cash was already legally yours and not being transferred directly from a deceased person's account. In most other cases, you would be required to submit a certified copy of the death certificate to a financial institution in order to transfer or deposit inherited funds into your account. Banks use these official documents to confirm an individual's passing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Inheritance tax vs. estate tax </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As you note, only a handful of states levy an inheritance tax - Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania - and the amount owed typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. While there is no federal inheritance tax, the IRS does impose a federal estate tax, and the exemption threshold is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2026, estates generally must file and potentially pay federal estate tax only if their taxable value exceeds $15 million, up from $13.99 million in 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An inheritance tax is paid by the recipient, and the amount typically depends on the heir's relationship to the deceased. By contrast, an estate tax is paid by the estate itself before any assets are distributed, although any interest or investment earnings generated after you receive it would be taxable. This includes the federal estate tax administered by the IRS. In other words, beneficiaries generally do not directly pay federal estate tax; it is settled by the estate prior to distribution.

With a revocable trust, the grantor can take the assets out if necessary. An irrevocable trust usually ties up the assets until the grantor dies.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bottom line: When you deposit a large cash amount - in this case, a $150,000 inheritance - the teller verifies your identity, records your explanation of the money's source, and processes the deposit normally. The transaction is then reviewed by automated monitoring systems, and if something seems inconsistent might the bank request documentation like estate paperwork. As for this $150,000: It's better off in your bank account than in a drawer. Follow the rules and you won't - fingers crossed - experience any problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'It's my money': My $800K inheritance is paying for a $1.6 million house.
