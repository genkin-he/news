A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 16, 2026. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Vistagen's plan to develop and commercialize its drug fasedienol, an investigational pherine candidate in development for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Defendants' statements included, among other things, Vistagen's positive assertions of fasedienol's future trial success based on the prior positive results associated with the PALISADE-2 clinical trial, in addition to notable enhancements and operational changes made to the execution of the PALISADE-3 clinical trial supported a strong likelihood of Phase 3 success and positioned it as a confirmatory study.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">According to the lawsuit, defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning its Phase 3 PALISADE-3 trial study of fasedienol. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">To join the Vistagen class action, go to <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4629425-1&amp;h=352681144&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50827&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D50827\" tabindex=\"0\">https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50827</a> or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:case@rosenlegal.com\" tabindex=\"0\">case@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action.</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">No Class Has Been Certified.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors are likely to refocus on potential 'AI winners,' according to UBS analysts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir Technologies' shares have been pressured by valuation concerns and broader market fears of artificial-intelligence-fueled disruption of software companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir Technologies' stock has been a fan favorite among retail investors. Now, Wall Street analysts are warming to the software company's story. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS analysts led by Karl Keirstead upgraded Palantir's stock (PLTR) to a buy rating, from neutral, on Thursday. The analysts wrote that it's now less of a \"struggle\" to justify the stock's valuation, as Palantir shares have come down 35% from their recent peak. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir's stock is currently trading at about $135. Keirstead has a $180 price target, implying upside of about 33%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Palantir's most recent quarter was a record-setting one for the company, bringing both a beat on revenue and earnings expectations. But investors have gotten more nervous about the stock's high valuation and whether artificial intelligence will disrupt software companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When UBS began covering Palantir in December 2024, the stock was trading at 124 times estimates for fiscal 2025 free cash flow, Keirstead noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, as the stock has declined while estimates have still moved higher, Palantir's stock is trading at a comparably easier-to-swallow multiple of 50-times 2027 free-cash-flow estimates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UBS cast a hypothetical scenario where Palantir can grow at a roughly 50% compound annual rate over the next three years. In that scenario, the 2027 free-cash-flow multiple would be decreased to just one times its projected rate of growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This we believe is finally at a level that many investors can make a strong valuation case for the stock,\"  Keirstead said in a Thursday note, predicting that that investors will return to \"AI winner\" stocks like Palantir this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He's not the only analyst showing more confidence in Palantir. About 60% of analysts covering the company now rate it at the equivalent of a buy, up from 25% in December, according to FactSet data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Mizuho's Greg Moskowitz last week upgraded the stock to outperform, from neutral. Like Keirstead, he cited the recent selloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Palantir is in a category of one, delivering total revenue growth, acceleration and margin expansion at scale that is unlike anything else in software,\" Moskowitz wrote in a note to investors. \"We believe the derating has occurred and that the risk/reward is now attractive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Palantir's stock looks less 'frothy' and is now worth buying, this analyst says </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Of course, not everyone is bullish on Palantir. Two of the 31 analysts covering the stock have sell ratings, while 10 others have hold ratings, according to FactSet. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Michael Burry - the former hedge-fund manager featured in \"The Big Short\" for his bets against the housing market in the run-up to the global financial crisis - is shorting the stock. Recently, he highlighted that Palantir's accounts receivable have been growing faster than revenue for nine of the last 12 quarters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's \"a persistent pattern generally attached to nefarious tricks such as channel stuffing, aggressive revenue recognition or extended payment terms used as sales concessions,\" Burry said in a recent Substack post. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: They bet everything on Palantir and became millionaires. Inside the market's ultimate cult stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -William Gavin </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Part of it has to do with droughts and wildfires in the U.S. Midwest, as well as a deterioration in crop health in France. An attack by Russia on Ukrainian infrastructure in the port city of Odesa, and tensions between the U.S. and Iran that has traders across markets adjusting their positions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Taking Cues: Corn futures rose to the highest their level this year. The grain received support from higher crude oil futures as U.S.-Iran tensions remain unresolved heading into the weekend. \"The two sides will resume more technical discussions next week in Vienna,\" StoneX's said Arlan Suderman in a note. \"A bulked-up U.S. military presence in the Middle East remains.\" Corn's price is tied to oil due to ethanol, which is a major consumer of commodity that is an ingredient blended into American motor fuel. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Overseas Interest: The USDA reported a flash sale of U.S. corn exports for the second consecutive day, this time in a notice that said 257,000 metric tons were headed to \"unknown destinations\" for delivery in the 2025/26 marketing year. That phrase when included in USDA statements is often--but not always--used in connection with China. Grain traders continue to look for confirmation of China buying more U.S. soybeans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Sticking Around: The latest U.S. inflation gauge showed price increases are likely to remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for a while. January's producer price index unexpectedly accelerated, and other indicators are expected to show inflation remains stubborn. \"The data out this morning actually points to inflation being a nagging frustration for the U.S. economy,\" Comerica's Bill Adams said. The Fed is expected to remain cautious when considering rate cuts in the coming months.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Myra P. Saefong and Barbara Kollmeyer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. government on Friday urged nonemergency government workers to leave Israel </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The U.S. State Department on Friday urged nonemergency U.S. workers to leave Israel after talks over Tehran's nuclear program ended Thursday without a deal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices finished Friday at their highest level in roughly seven months, as President Donald Trump reportedly suggested that a U.S. military strike on Iran is still being considered following a failed attempt this week to reach a deal to end Tehran's nuclear ambitions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump told reporters outside the White House Friday that he would \"love not to use\" the U.S. military to attack Iran, but \"sometimes you have to,\" according to a report from CNBC. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The report also said that a final decision on whether to attack Iran has not yet been made. An emailed request to the White House from MarketWatch for further comment on Iran wasn't immediately answered. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil prices finished higher Friday in the wake of Trump's reported remarks. April West Texas Intermediate crude (CLJ26) (CL.1) rose 2.8% to settle at $67.02 a barrel - its highest finish since Aug. 1. The contract gained 0.8% for the week and rose 2.8% for the month of February, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     April Brent crude (BRNJ26) climbed 2.5% to settle at $72.48 a barrel, the highest since July 31. The contract gained 1% for the week and 2.5% for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The oil market is providing a reminder that until \"documents are signed and money changes hands, there is no deal,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Oman-mediated talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva ended on Thursday with \"significant progress,\" Badr Albusaidi, Oman's foreign minister, said in a post on X Thursday. He said talks would resume after \"consultation in the respective capitals,\" with the two sides holding \"technical level\" discussions next week in Vienna. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Talks are extending into another week, but ironically, the longer they go on, the higher oil prices seem to go. This is because the markets are sensing that the Iranians could be stringing [President] Trump along and at one point, Mr. Trump may lose his patience and tell his negotiators to come home,\" Edward Meir, an analyst at Marex, said in comments emailed Friday morning. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"At the end of the day, it should not take weeks and weeks to come to an agreement and the markets are getting nervous waiting,\" Meir added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: U.S.-Iran nuclear talks end, but with hope that negotiations continue. That still leaves the oil market in limbo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Congressional Democrats are expected to force a vote on a war powers resolution linked to Iran next week, in a bid to prevent Trump from taking military action against Iran without the prior approval of Congress. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Friday saw the U.S. State Department authorize nonemergency U.S. government personnel and their family members to leave Israel \"due to safety risks,\" which weren't specified. The order also warned of potential restrictions on travel to areas of Israel, the Old City of Jerusalem and the West Bank, while suggesting \"persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Trump has said the U.S. military has assembled an armada of warships and fighter jets near Iran. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said markets are also focused on the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Sunday. There has been speculation that members may resume production increases starting in April, he said, after the group decided to leave output quotas unchanged for the first quarter of 2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"While OPEC+ estimates that supply and demand will be in balance throughout this year, the International Energy Agency maintains its forecast of an oversupply of 3.7 million barrels per day throughout 2026,\" Morrison said in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Myra P.
