Plenty of comments soon followed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Who needs to dress up? Some airline passengers opt for comfort. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These days, it's not unusual to see people sporting pajamas outside the home - for a walk in the park or even when dining at a fancy restaurant. The trend of sleepwear as everyday wear is all the rage, according to fashion experts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But if you're considering joining the pajama party, should you think twice if your travel plans include a stop in Tampa, Fla.? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a post on X that went viral - with 7.1 million views as of Thursday afternoon - Tampa International Airport announced that \"It's time to ban pajamas.\" The post went on to say that \"The madness stops today\" and also referenced an earlier ban on Crocs at the airport. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To be clear, the airport's \"bans\" are actually intended as something of a joke. But officials explained they are meant to raise awareness of issues surrounding what constitutes appropriate travel wear. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Tampa International Airport regularly shares lighthearted, satirical social-media content as part of our ongoing effort to engage with our followers,\" the airport said in a statement to MarketWatch. \"Today's post about 'banning' pajamas was another playful nod to day-of-travel fashion debates. We encourage our passengers to travel comfortably and appreciate our loyal followers who enjoy the online humor.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Certainly, if sparking debate was the goal, the post did just that. Even if some who commented on the post didn't necessarily understand that the \"ban\" was in jest, they pointed to the era when people dressed up to fly, as if they were attending a special occasion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Let's go back to the way it was in the '50s, '60s and '70s!\" said one commenter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Others said it's not worth it to dress up, especially given the hassles now often associated with air travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"I'll dress nice again when we're not treated like cattle at the airport and on the plane,\" said another commenter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Let's not also forget how the issue came to light, when U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy encouraged travelers to upgrade their wardrobe. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Let's try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport,\" Duffy said at Newark Liberty International Airport last November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Regardless of how anyone feels about pajamas as everyday wear, including at the airport, the trend is decidedly there. Global pajama sales are expected to total nearly $12.5 billion this year and are projected to grow to roughly $21.5 billion by 2035, according to one research report. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Experts say the trend has been accelerated by the shift to remote work in recent years - in effect, why dress up if you're not leaving the house? At the same time, people are embracing the idea of going super-casual outside the home, which means pajamas at the airport or just about anywhere else. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fashion brands have jumped on the trend, offering loungewear styles that can work in a variety of settings. Celebrities have been quick to follow suit: Think Margot Robbie sporting pink pajamas at a movie screening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'You can't degrade the travel experience for decades and then scold people for dressing to endure the experience.'Etiquette expert Nick Leighton </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So, are you free to wear those PJs as you get ready to board your next flight? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Etiquette expert Nick Leighton says it's a hard question to answer for a number of reasons. He points to the aforementioned issue of airline travel becoming more stressful and uncomfortable - hence, the desire to go more casual. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can't degrade the travel experience for decades and then scold people for dressing to endure the experience,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Plus, as sleepwear styles become more fashionable, it's hard to think of them as strictly for the slovenly set. \"What exactly counts as pajamas?\" Leighton said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Patrick Arnzen, a former airline pilot who's now chief executive of Thrust Flight, a pilot school, says being comfortable on a flight isn't a bad idea from a health standpoint. He points to the need to maintain good circulation and avoid deep vein thrombosis (in other words, a blood clot), which is always a risk during air travel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"That's why I recommend breathable fabrics, compression socks if you're prone to swelling, and always layers,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     At the same time, Arnzen points out the risk of going too casual. For example, he says you don't want to be sporting flip-flops or sandals in the event of an emergency. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wear something that \"won't slow you down if you ever need to exit quickly,\" Arnzen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Charles Passy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

That's a problem in this \"no hire\" economy, as one economics writer put it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More than 9 in 10 people said they didn't have a side gig in retirement, but 60% wished they did, according to a survey by the financial-services firm D.A. Davidson. This comes in the middle of what people are calling a \"no hire\" economy, where finding work in retirement is becoming a struggle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consider these statistics about the deep freeze in the labor market: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- People think they have only a 43% chance of finding work in the next three months if they lose their job, the lowest level in 12 years, a New York Fed survey in December said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- The U.S. added essentially zero jobs over the last five months and just 44,000 a month last year, the lowest since the pandemic recession. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- 37% of workers surveyed by the Employee Benefit Research Institute said they've seen hiring freezes at their employers in the past 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- The 108,435 layoffs announced in January - including huge job cuts at Amazon AMZN and UPS UPS -were the highest to start a year since 2009, according to the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- 81% of recruiters post \"ghost jobs,\" positions that are nonexistent or have already been filled, a MyPerfectResume survey found. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And that's affecting workers across all ages, not just older individuals who may face the additional struggles of age discrimination in the workplace or hiring process. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"There's a sense of precarity in the air. I think it's going to be a rough year,\" said Kerry Hannon, author of \"Great Jobs for Everyone 50+,\" at the recent Trendspotting 2026 webinar about older workers. The webinar was offered by the Encore Network, a nonprofit championing people over 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Why is job hunting so tough these days? Many employers are reluctant to hire workers, including people looking for part-time jobs in retirement, because they're apprehensive about the economy. Consumer spending is expected to slow, and businesses are turning to AI as an alternative to bringing on staff for things like customer service and data entry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's more, said Isaiah Hankel, author of the new book \"Too Good to Get Hired,\" America has an \"overqualified\" crisis, with employers routinely snubbing older job applicants due to their age and years of experience. \"'Too good to get hired' sounds like an oxymoron, right?\" he said. \"You would think it's impossible to be too good to get hired. But the data shows this is just not the case.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hankel, the older-worker experts at the Encore webinar panel and LinkedIn authorities have seven smart tips for finding jobs in retirement: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For anyone preparing to retire, review your finances and start thinking about where to look for part-time work </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If you're nervous, 2026 is a year to plan, said panelist Chris Farrell, senior economics contributor at American Public Media's Marketplace radio program and author of \"Unretirement.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Come up with a budget you can control and reach out to people in your network,\" he advised. Then, Farrell noted, you might be able to say to yourself: \"If I make this amount of money, I'm going to be OK financially not making as much as I did before.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Spend more time networking than applying to online job listings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most online job applications result in a 0.1% to 2% success rate, according to the HiringThing blog. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"You can't rely on job boards the way you used to,\" Hankel said. A Congressional Research Service report said 27% of all U.S. job listings on LinkedIn are likely ghost jobs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consider boomeranging part time to the employer you retired from </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Boomeranging used to be something companies would avoid; there was a stigma attached to it,\" Farrell said. \"That has changed dramatically, because the employer knows who the person is and what they can do.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When applying for jobs in retirement, play up what you can do for an employer - not what you've done </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Make more potential-based statements, not just proof-based statements about your prior work,\" Hankel said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fix your LinkedIn Profile to be a stronger job candidate </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The LinkedIn social-media platform recently launched an AI-powered ranking and recommendation system called 360Brew, which makes job candidates get seen more - or less - depending on how they appear to the algorithm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The 360Brew system favors consistency, linear careers and clear titles, wrote Viveka von Rosen, a career adviser for women age 50-plus, in a LinkedIn post. She recommends ensuring your LinkedIn headline isn't vague, your About section isn't bloated and your Experience section doesn't read like a \"resumé archive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Speaking at an Encore webinar about \"the new LinkedIn,\" communications specialist Debra Yearwood recommended writing a LinkedIn headline that combines your desired position and your skills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Yearwood also advised amplifying your LinkedIn profile's Experience section by showing your personal brand. \"Put in a bit of a description of the work you did at a job, the organization itself and your achievements there,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Be sure to include the skills you've acquired, and that your top two show up at the beginning of your profile. Ask former colleagues to endorse those two skills, too. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Look for jobs in fields related to the aging of the U.S. population </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We have a critical mass of baby boomers who are getting older, and a Silent Generation who's getting even older. They need access to products, services and care,\" said panelist Catherine Collinson, who publishes the Transamerica Institute's annual Transamerica Retirement Survey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hannon calls this \"riding the age wave,\" and notes that getting hired to serve the health needs of older adults doesn't require a medical background. \"You could be a healthcare accountant or a project manager or use skills from a previous job,\" she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Deflect employers' ageist hiring practices by starting a business in retirement </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In a recent Harris Poll, 69% of professionals said owning a business is the best protection against ageism in the workforce, antiageism advocate Janine Vanderburg wrote on LinkedIn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While running a small business could be a lot to manage in retirement, there are some options that play into a retiree's experiences and skills. For example, among the 25 fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. for 2026, according to LinkedIn: strategic advisers, independent consultants, and founders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Solo entrepreneurship is continuing to grow,\" Farrell said. \"That's probably the one part of the job market to be the most optimistic about.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Richard Eisenberg </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

So far this year, the stock has edged up 0.5% through Friday, to match the S&amp;P 500's performance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel's first shareholder letter also comes at a time that Berkshire's insurance business has struggled, to the point that the company will not be looking to grow the business for a while. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Following are some other key insights from Abel's letter to shareholders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investments in Japan are as important as U.S. holdings </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel noted that a large portion of Berkshire's equity investments are held in a small number of U.S. companies, notably investments in Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and Moody's (MCO). The total market value of those holdings was $158.6 billion as of Dec. 31. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long-term economic prospects,\" Abel wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The same methodology in choosing investments in American companies is used in finding opportunities in Japan, \"which we view as comparable to our major U.S. holdings in importance and long-term value-creation opportunity.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The largest Japan holdings, with a total market value of $35.37 billion, are Mitsubishi (JP: 8058), Itochu (JP: 8001), Mitsui &amp; Co. (MITSY), Marubeni (MARUY) and Sumitomo (SSUMY). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Kraft Heinz holding has disappointed </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As Buffett said in last year's shareholder letter, there have been some mistakes in Berkshire's investments. Abel noted that Kraft Heinz was one of them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Our investment in Kraft Heinz has been disappointing,\" Abel wrote. \"Even after considering the preferred equity component in our original Heinz investment, our return has been well short of adequate.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel appeared to be setting the stage for Berkshire make a big change. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In January, Kraft Heinz disclosed that Berkshire \"may offer to sell\" its 325.4 million shares stake in the company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buffett was a big backer of the Kraft Foods and Heinz merger in 2015. After a decade of share price underperformance, Kraft Heinz said in September it will break up. But new CEO Steve Cahillane said he was putting the breakup plan on hold, so he can focus on fixing the problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earnings fall for the quarter and year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Net income in the latest quarter fell 2.5% from the same period a year ago to $19.2 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Operating earnings, which exclude investment gains and other nonrecurring items, declined 29.8% to $10.2 billion for the quarter, and were down 6.2% for the year to $44.5 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Abel noted, however, that while 2025 earnings showed a decline, they were above the $37.5 billion in earnings Berkshire has averaged over the past five years, which he said underscores the durability of Berkshire's operating business, while also showing there's room for improvement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Insurance struggles could continue </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Central to the weakness in operating earnings during the fourth quarter was Berkshire's insurance business, in which the total of insurance underwriting and insurance-investment income dropped 38.2% to $4.6 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While the company reassesses how insurance policies are priced, Abel said the businesses, which includes Geico, will not be growing for a while. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Their performance reflected both their inherent strengths and an industry that, after several years of needed adjustments to pricing and policy terms, in 2025 began to experience a deceleration or reversal of these trends, particularly in the latter half of the year,\" Abel wrote. \"This likely means we will write less property and casualty business for a period of time.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ajit Jain, who Abel said is \"peerless\" in pricing insurance risk, runs Berkshire's insurance operations. Before Abel was named as Buffett's successor last year, Jain was considered a top candidate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Buffett remains a fixture at the office </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here's how Abel's first shareholder letter started: \"Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He said, however, that Buffett shouldn't be viewed solely as an investment guru. What will endure, according to his successor as CEO, is how he ran his businesses, and how he treated shareholders as partners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And Buffett may no longer be running the business, but Abel reminded shareholders that Buffett will still be in the office \"five days a week\" as chairman, and will continue to have a say in which stocks Berkshire buys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Venessa Wong </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Baby boomers may not be the 'avocado toast' generation, but they have plenty of their own wasteful and financially damaging habits </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Boomers are more wasteful in certain spending categories than their younger counterparts. These habits can be harmful for the many people in this cohort who are financially vulnerable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The wasteful habits of millennials and Gen Z members should come as no surprise - it has been well documented that many of these consumers are prone to impulse online spending and have grown addicted to the convenience of delivery apps. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But new survey data show that baby boomers - America's richest generation and one often perceived as being thriftier those that followed - are more wasteful in certain spending categories than younger people. And those habits can be especially harmful for the many people in this unevenly wealthy cohort who are financially vulnerable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Specifically, baby boomers are more likely than the average consumer to waste food by throwing out leftovers or expired items, to leave appliances or utilities running unnecessarily, to buy brand-name pantry items and to buy lottery tickets, according to a recent survey by Motley Fool Money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     And these habits have only gotten more expensive: Food prices increased by 2.9% in January compared with a year earlier, gas utility costs rose by 9.8% and electricity went up 6.3%, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Once you are drawing from savings instead of building it, small recurring expenses matter more,\" said Melissa Caro, a financial planner and founder of My Retirement Network, a financial education site. \"Utilities, food waste and lifestyle inflation can quietly erode cash flow over a 20- to 30-year retirement. Even households with meaningful assets need to manage longevity risk, healthcare uncertainty and rising living costs.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Boomers - who were born between 1946 and 1964 - were more likely than Americans on average to waste money during shopping trips, while on vacation or for special occasions, the poll of 2,000 U.S. adults found. Their most common trigger was sales and discounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On the other hand, millennials, who were born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, were more likely to waste money online late at night. Members of Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980, were the most vulnerable to emotionally driven shopping but, along with boomers, were much more likely than younger generations to resist social-media trends and peer influence, the Motley Fool survey showed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Despite their wasteful ways, boomers are the wealthiest cohort in U.S. history. Many were buoyed by the postwar economic boom, access to affordable college educations and workplace pensions, and growth in the housing and stock markets, MarketWatch recently reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In line with broader trends in the economy, however, their wealth is not evenly distributed across the generation. Pew Research Center found that the top 10% of boomer households owned 71% of the generation's overall wealth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For instance, Americans 70 to 74, who fall in the middle of the current boomer age range, have a median net worth of about $476,000, including home equity, MarketWatch previously reported - meaning half of the people in that group have a net worth that is lower. The net worth for those in the 90th percentile is nearly $3.3 million, or 6.8 times the median. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This wealth gap suggests that for many boomers, wasteful spending habits could have a meaningful impact on their financial well-being. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The \"huge inequality within the boomer generation itself\" means \"some have paid-off homes and strong portfolios. Others rely almost entirely on Social Security and have very little margin for error,\" Juan G. HernandezAriano, a financial planner and principal at WealthCreate, told MarketWatch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In his experience, boomers are largely \"pretty cost-conscious in day-to-day spending,\" but many are casual about larger financial decisions that \"slowly chip away at retirement security,\" such as underestimating healthcare expenses or being overly conservative with their investments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Only 40% of boomers - the youngest of whom are already 62 years old - are ready for retirement, Vanguard estimates, meaning their projected sustainable income exceeds their spending needs. These people are \"concentrated among the top 30% of income earners.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other signs that many boomers may be victims of poor spending habits: More reported living paycheck to paycheck - meaning their spending on necessities took up more than 95% of their income - in 2025 than in 2023, according to the Bank of America Institute. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The average credit-card debt was $6,795 for boomers, 82.9% of whom had credit-card debt in 2025, a higher rate than millennials (77.9%) or Gen Z (72.2%), according to Experian. They were also the most likely to have home-equity lines of credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Some may not even be aware of their spending habits. Boomers were more likely than other generations to say they never waste money - but \"that doesn't mean that there isn't waste. It just shows up a little differently,\" Joel O'Leary, personal finance expert at Motley Fool Money, told MarketWatch. \"It's more like throwing away unused groceries or continuing to go to Costco or some of those expensive stores and buying in bulk, and then throwing away much of it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Wasteful habits are harmful when they start to impact financial security. While one-third of baby boomers said they had to tap their emergency savings in the last 12 months,16% of people in this age range said they have no emergency savings, according to 2025 Bankrate data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Like any consumer, boomers who want to avoid wasting money can consider tracking and analyzing expenses and cutting back on expenses that don't actually improve their quality of life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While Caro \"wouldn't describe wasteful spending as a defining boomer trait,\" she noted that \"many boomers were raised by parents who lived through the Great Depression. That experience tends to produce strong money beliefs - sometimes in the direction of extreme thrift, and sometimes in the opposite direction. In families where scarcity was intense, the next generation can either internalize 'waste not, want not' or subconsciously react against it.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What personal-finance issues would you like to see covered in MarketWatch?

That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes were nearing, as Trump suggested to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The brief June 2025 conflict is a poor guide to what is likely to follow,\" said Nick Redman, analyst at Oxford Analytica, a geopolitical risk-analysis and advisory service owned by MarketWatch publisher Dow Jones. \"Then, Iran sought to avoid confrontation because it understood U.S. objectives were limited, meaning that regional relations and wider international legitimacy were worth preserving.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Now, however, Iran might look to \"hunker down or seek to draw out any conflict,\" according to Redman. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     European leaders from Britain, France and Germany issued a statement Saturday saying their countries had not taken part in the Iran strikes, but they added that they had been in close contact with the U.S., Israel and partners in the region. They called for a resumption of negotiations, the Associated Press reported. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Investors might see a \"relatively predictable\" reaction to the strikes on Iran, starting with a big leap in crude prices, said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, in a note to clients. \"At this stage there are many unknowns, and the situation is incredibly fast-moving.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Should a longer, more complicated conflict unfold, the U.S. could tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to keep a lid on oil and gasoline prices. U.S. benchmark crude shot up to over $130 a barrel in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, the U.S could quickly ramp up domestic production given its shale resources, and it also now exerts control over Venezuela's oil, Meli at Monachil Capital said. That should help keep crude prices in a range, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Likely to get a bid are haven assets, such as gold (GC00), which jumped nearly 11% in February, finishing at $5,230.50 an ounce on Friday. That marked gold's biggest one-month percentage gain since January 2012, and its monthly gain of $516.60 was the biggest one-month net gain on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse at how investors might react as they wait for Asian markets to open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was steady, around $66,000, after briefly sinking to a level not seen since early February. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Apart from surging oil prices on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP and Dow industrials DJIA tumbled after the January PPI report reflected a surprise spike in U.S. wholesale inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Brown at Pepperstone said the Japanese yen (USDJPY), Swiss franc (USDCHF) and U.S. Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD30Ywould also likely be in the outperformer category.

He was asked by liana Bouzali, Morgan Stanley's global head of derivatives, distribution and structuring, how he would construct a hedge-fund portfolio from scratch today. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Druckenmiller said such portfolio building would take into account a strengthening U.S. economy and potential for Fed rate cuts, though, given highly valued equities, he prefers longer positions in a more \"eclectic basket of stocks.\" The AI trade to him is not longer so big, he added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"[O]ur portfolio,\" he indicated, over the past three years, had been \"very much AI-driven. We still have dribs and drabs of AI around, but it's not driving the engine anymore, to some extent,\" said Druckenmiller. He's still excited, he said, about the opportunity for \"massive disruption and massive change\" in the next three or four years, which would be a plus for any hedge fund starting now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: The week, FOBO - 'fear of becoming obsolete' because of AI - became real for workers and markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Macro has been dead for 10 or 15 years,\" he observed. \"I don't think that's the case anymore.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Druckenmiller said he's still got \"big positions in Japan and Korea,\" with some of that in AI. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ is up 40% over a one-year span, and the iShares MSCI Korea ETF EWY up 55%, versus a gain of 15% for the S&amp;P 500 SPX. A 13F filing released earlier this month showed Druckenmiller's family office also made a well-time bet on the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF EWZ in the final quarter of 2025. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Earlier this week: The milestones keep coming for the world's hottest stock market </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: U.S. stocks are falling behind. It could be the beginning of an epic shift toward global markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We're bearish on the U.S. dollar, mainly because [it has been] sort of [at] the top of the historic range in terms of purchasing power, and foreigners are way, way overloaded in dollars,\" he added. Whether that's a sell-America trade or just buying fewer U.S. assets, he expects the currency DXY will weaken. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As for copper (HG00), up 32% over the past 52 weeks and up 6% in 2026, Druckenmiller said it's \"not a genius trade\" but makes sense given supply will be pretty tight over the next eight years, with extra demand from AI and data centers. He said his family office is not investing big in copper miners but keeps rolling over exposure to front-month copper, and it has gold (GC00) exposure, though, in that case, for geopolitical rather than industrial reasons. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     See: Trump calls for regime change after U.S.-Israel attack on Iran. Markets should brace for more than June's brief military campaign. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gold is up 84% over the last year, having seen a historic rally. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Druckenmiller said that, given his family office's long exposure to lots of risk assets, it's keeping a short position in bonds, which wouldn't be a big moneymaker unless he's right and the economy sees disinflationary growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If I'm wrong and the strong growth creates inflation - it wouldn't be that unusual if the Fed were to cut into a booming economy for inflation to take off, particularly with what's going on with commodities. So I'm open-minded to that. But we create a matrix, and the bonds are helpful in both ways,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The interview with Druckenmiller was conducted on Jan. 30, just ahead of the February ascent of an AI fear trade that pummeled software and other sectors exposed to artificial-intelligence technology. Investors have also been piling into bond markets on fears that AI advances will decimate the job market, while hotter-than-expected producer prices have clouded hopes for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. stocks plunged on Friday after the PPI data pointed to worryingly persistent inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Any chance of a Fed interest-rate cut in 2026 is 'evaporating before our very eyes' with Iran war set to stoke oil prices </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Druckenmiller said contrarianism is \"overrated,\" and he isn't bothered by exposure to a crowded trade. But he also flagged past mistakes, such as buying Nvidia (NVDA) in the first half of 2022 but then cutting his stake in mid-2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He also discussed a big bet on biotech, highlighting how the market has been undervaluing one pick, Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), of which he became more enthusiastic following a meeting with its management. The \"best use case out there of AI is biotech, through drug discovery, diagnostics, monitoring - everything,\" Druckenmiller said, noting that that sector has \"been on its butt for like four years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read on: Private-credit 'cockroaches' and the AI 'scare trade' hammered stocks in February.
