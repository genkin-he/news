(Patria Re) (Mexico). AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” (Good) of Patria Re’s ultimate parent, Peña Verde, S.A.B. (Peña Verde) (Mexico). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Per AM Best’s criteria procedure on insurance holding companies, Peña Verde’s rating reflects a standard notching from Patria Re’s Long-Term ICR.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe ratings reflect Patria Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe stable outlooks reflect Patria Re’s ability to maintain a stable and profitable operation along with a strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), while implementing its business expansion strategy.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re is Mexico's only locally registered reinsurer, founded in 1953. The company has a strong niche position in Mexico and in other Latin America markets, which allows it to accept profitable business selectively while maintaining a diversified product portfolio tailored to specific markets, where it has developed very strong client relationships. This strategy has resulted in consistently favorable underwriting results over the past few years.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nPatria Re’s balance sheet strength assessment of strongest is supported by that same assessment on the company’s level of risk-adjusted capitalization, low underwriting leverage, a robust reinsurance program placed among counterparties with a strong security level and strong liquidity metrics. The ratings also reflect its comprehensive ERM infrastructure and expansive knowledge of its core markets in Latin America, which reflects the company’s smooth implementation of its expansion strategy with a stable overseas operation outside its niche market.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nDespite limitations posted by catastrophe reserve development, Patria Re reported positive bottom-line results in 2024, mainly driven by favorable underwriting results. The company’s strong underwriting practices allowed Patria Re to report a bottom-line result of MXN 1 billion. The company’s efforts to maintain stable claims and management expenses have resulted in a profitable first six months for 2025, with a bottom-line of MXN 347 million, despite the limitations of catastrophe reserve development.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFactors that could lead to positive rating actions for the company include a consistent upward trend in profitability metrics that compare well with the strong operating performance, while maintaining its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as well as the continued and successful operation of its overseas expansion. Factors that may lead to negative rating actions include a sustained deterioration in risk-adjusted capitalization, driven either by unfavorable results or a significant cash withdrawal.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Typically, a stronger U.S. dollar makes U.S. grain exports less attractive for global customers versus the exports of other countries. Seemingly outweighing this uptick in the dollar is the desire of traders to get their books in order ahead of the weekend, said Brady Huck of Advance Trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The Next Episode: The agricultural market is now looking past the U.S.-China deal and spent the day searching for the next major mover of futures. \"Grain action and volume slowed considerably overnight with the U.S.-China trade deal having come and gone,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases, although reports of cargoes did circulate today. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Going the Distance: Some analysts are unsure if soybean purchasing under the pending U.S.-China trade truce will take place as promised, even amid reports of Chinese buyers securing some new soybean cargoes. One reason is because there are no penalties described to enforce China's purchasing of 12 million metric tons of soybeans in this marketing year, along with 25 million tons of soybeans annually for the following three years. \"Whether China secures 25 MMTs in future years depends on the price relationships between South America and the U.S.\" AgResource said in a note. \"China buys what China needs at the cheapest price offered -- it's that simple.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Dried Out: The U.S. Drought Monitor, which has remained in operation through the government shutdown, is showing dryness spread throughout the eastern Corn Belt states. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map, but also large areas of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest -- but the dryness likely hasn't helped those conditions. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  -Tyson Foods Co. will release its fourth quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  October 31, 2025 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

As Komigo moves toward a full launch, Maxfield is sharing his vision for the company and the inspiration that drives its mission.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nSocial selling has grown fast, but not always simply. Many creators juggle multiple brand deals, track complex commissions, and manage fragmented systems. Komigo was built to fix that. The platform brings trusted brands, analytics, and earnings into one space, offering creators transparency and control while helping brands connect with audiences in more authentic ways.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Komigo was born from listening,” said Maxfield, Founder and CEO of Komigo. “Creators told us they wanted freedom to represent multiple brands, to understand their data, and to see their earnings clearly. Komigo is our answer to that call. It’s designed to make authenticity scalable.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nKomigo introduces a suite of tools designed to make social influence simple and sustainable. With QuickCart and QuickLinks, creators can instantly share individual products or full collections, streamlining the path from recommendation to purchase. The platform’s KomigoBox subscription feature transforms recurring engagement into predictable income, giving creators a reliable foundation for long-term growth.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nComplementing these features, Komigo’s transparent analytics provide clear visibility into performance, showing what resonates, where sales originate, and how creators can strengthen their businesses with data-driven confidence.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Our goal is to redefine what social selling feels like for creators, for brands, and for customers. We want transparency, simplicity, and purpose to drive every interaction,” says Maxfield.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nAs Komigo expands, it plans to partner with brands across industries, from beauty and wellness to lifestyle and home products, creating an ecosystem where authenticity and commerce can grow together. The company’s broader impact lies in reshaping how creators earn and how brands connect, setting a new standard for trust, transparency, and meaningful engagement in the social commerce space.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Derek Maxfield is an entrepreneur, innovator, and philanthropist whose career spans technology, direct sales, and social impact. Over more than two decades, he has founded and guided multiple ventures that merge purpose with performance. He is the CEO of Komigo and co-founded Younique, a global beauty brand that pioneered social commerce within direct sales. Maxfield serves as a founding board member of Saprea, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting survivors of childhood sexual abuse. He brings a leadership philosophy rooted in authenticity, innovation, and impact, driving teams to build companies that do well by doing good.</em>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more news and information about Derek Maxfield, please visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fderek-maxfield-043691118&amp;esheet=54349003&amp;newsitemid=20251031916494&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fderek-maxfield-043691118&amp;index=2&amp;md5=666f38dd93c510440526dcfdc3729796\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-maxfield-043691118</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nFor more information on Komigo, visit <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.komigo.com%2F&amp;esheet=54349003&amp;newsitemid=20251031916494&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.komigo.com%2F&amp;index=3&amp;md5=18bae4b26718cb0ae25780fb115e752a\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.komigo.com/</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-f0ef0696=\"\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20251031916494r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\"/></picture></span><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Media Contact: </strong>Komigo Public Relations\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Phone:</strong> (435)271-9756\n<br data-v-602de5d2=\"\"/><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-479a2324=\"\">Email:</strong> <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"mailto:PR@komigo.com\" tabindex=\"0\">PR@komigo.com</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span data-v-602de5d2=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251031916494/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251031916494/en/</a></span></p></div>",
