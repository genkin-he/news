The movement higher doesn't appear supported by fundamentals, said Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note. \"We are still looking for that elusive fundamental reason why wheat is hanging in around its highs after a 49-cent rally since the beginning of the calendar year,\" says Sernatinger. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Summit Squabble: A story from the South China Morning Post said the potential summit between President Trump and Chinese president Xi is experiencing issues, which the story attributes to \"planning gaps and weak coordination on the U.S. side.\" The story was a pressure point for soybeans Thursday,  as well as livestock futures, due to the export demand from those products coming from China. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  INSIGHT </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Always in the Background: Analysts are keeping a close eye on how the Brazilian harvest is progressing, and preparing for the surge of Brazilian soybeans hitting the global export market. The record amount of soybeans expected from Brazil may create a short-term ceiling for prices. \"It would be unusual for the biggest soybean harvest the world has ever seen (Brazil) to not slow down price gains in the beans at some point,\" said Doug Bergman of RCM Alternatives in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Missing the Mark: Export sales of U.S. corn fell below the expectations of analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this week. The USDA said Thursday that corn export sales across the 2025/26 and 2026/27 marketing years totaled 697,500 metric tons for the week ended Feb. 19. Analysts had forecast sales to land between 900,000 tons and 1.8 million tons. Soybean and wheat sales landed on the low end of analyst expectations for the week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  New Sale: The USDA said this morning that 178,000 metric tons of corn were sold to Japan, with 154,000 tons for delivery during the 2026/2027 marketing year and an additional 24,000 tons for 2027/28 delivery. While the market welcomes flash sales, Thursday's notice isn't the one many traders were hoping to see -  that would be a sale of soybeans to China, which was rumored among market participants this week. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  AHEAD </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Agricultural Prices report at 3 p.m. ET Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The CFTC will release its weekly Commitment of Traders report at 3:30 p.m. ET Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its weekly Grain Export Inspections report at 11 a.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Grain Crushings report at 3 p.m. ET Monday. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 26, 2026 15:25 ET (20:25 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

Utilizing end-to-end edge computing technology, Toshiba's solution also minimizes the risk of shrink, builds shopper trust, and enhances checkout speed for a seamless and enjoyable self-service experience.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe 27 locations participating in the pilot are already generating measurable benefits in customer satisfaction and store productivity. Stores are reporting a 50% - 70% increase in self-checkout transactions. A defining feature of ELERA® Security Suite that is critical for the retailer includes accurately recognizing over 700 unique produce codes and a wide assortment of fresh produce. The solution is also reducing staff self-checkout intervention rates from 50% to about 10%—20%. By spending less time at self-checkout, employees are empowered to focus on higher-value responsibilities around the store.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“The self-checkout improvements provided by Toshiba and ELERA® Security Suite are especially significant on high-traffic days when produce promotions attract more shoppers. My team and I can provide better customer service when we can work efficiently and with less stress during peak hours,” said Adriana Correa, Store Manager at Hipermarket El Dorado, a chain under Group El Rosado. “When fewer team members are at self-checkout, our staff can focus on other operational tasks and increase overall productivity across the store.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nWith the rollout completed in less than four months, the rapid successful pilot implementation is a testament to the strong collaboration between Grupo El Rosado, Toshiba, and valued partners. <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compuhelp.com.ec%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=COMPUHELP&amp;index=5&amp;md5=89993f28afd40b7a9d421495b611cb16\" tabindex=\"0\">COMPUHELP</a> performed the installation, and systems integrator <a class=\"mdc-link__mdc mdc-link--body__mdc\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F33sur.cl%2F&amp;esheet=54434581&amp;newsitemid=20260226148227&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=33%26%23176%3B+Sur&amp;index=6&amp;md5=fe0ddf1a73599fff108b002e7ad77f17\" tabindex=\"0\">33° Sur</a> was responsible for the seamless implementation. Throughout the project, the partner companies stayed in close collaboration and had ongoing system validations to keep the project on schedule and fine-tune produce recognition performance. This high level of coordination between the partners enabled the team to deliver a robust solution in time for the stores’ peak produce season.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n“Grupo El Rosado’s success with the ELERA® Security Suite reflects Toshiba’s commitment to innovation and our role as a trusted technology partner. By combining AI, computer vision, and edge computing, we’re enabling Grupo El Rosado to reimagine self-checkout to drive measurable improvements in customer experiences, shrink, and store operations,” said Manuel Medecigo VP Sales LATAM at Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions. “This collaboration showcases the significant impact of close, strategic partnerships and Toshiba’s deep retail expertise.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\nThe latest ELERA® Security Suite upgrade is among the many successful implementations between Grupo El Rosado and Toshiba.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Concerns about AI's potential as a destructive force on U.S. jobs have contributed to a rally in the 10-year note, sending its yield toward a 2026 low </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI fear trade appears to be spilling into the U.S. bond market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The bond market has caught a bid over much of the past month, with buyers stepping into a crucial part of the $30 trillion Treasury market partly because of anxiety over artificial intelligence's potential to wipe out many U.S. jobs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's according to Lawrence Gillum, the Charlotte, N.C.-based chief fixed-income strategist for broker-dealer LPL Financial. He attributed the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, yields on everything from the 1-year bill BX:TMUBMUSD01Y through the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y were slipping, despite a lack of any clear data or non-AI-related events that could explain those moves. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Importantly, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which is a peg for pricing new 30-year fixed mortgages, briefly dipped below 4.02% and was on track to close Thursday's session at its lowest level of 2026. It is down from around 4.3% on Jan. 20. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An easing of that crucial rate since January has spilled over into mortgage financing, where rates for new 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen below the 6% threshold for the first time in three-and-a-half years, according to Freddie Mac. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Mortgage rates fall below 6%, giving buyers a glimpse of affordability </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Treasury yields act as a benchmark on borrowing costs for many American consumers and businesses. They can be influenced by a variety of things - such as the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, expectations for the path of interest rates, and rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What's interesting now is that yields continue to trend lower even though the U.S. economy is generally holding up, expectations for the Federal Reserve's next rate cut have been pushed back to July, and the U.S. and Iran are involved in nuclear talks in Geneva that may reportedly produce an agreement. And while economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. Weekly jobless claims also remained near an exceedingly low level of 212,000 for the seven days that ended last Saturday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. Thursday's bond-market moves \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gillum described the downward path in yields as an \"interesting dynamic\" in which the bond market \"is not trading how you would expect it to trade,\" given the potential for continued elevated inflation pressures over the next few years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"We think, in the near term, that the AI buildout could keep inflation elevated for the next few years,\" Gillum said. \"What's interesting is that the bond market is not trading that. Instead, it's trading on the disinflationary impact that might happen a few years from now,\" as well as on a \"downgrade in economic expectations.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gillum's inflation view is shared by BofA Securities strategist Meghan Swiber and economist Stephen Juneau. In a note on Thursday, Swiber and Juneau wrote that they think, in the near-term, \"AI will drive more demand-side inflation from surging AI capex and a positive wealth effect.\" They added that \"the market narrative around disinflation effects has gotten ahead of itself\" because a slowing pace of price gains may not play out for another two years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On Thursday, investors were reconsidering the likely winners and losers from AI. Shares of software companies like Salesforce (CRM) and Intuit (INTU) were rallying on the possibility that they might benefit from AI, after having previously been punished on fears that their industry might be wiped out. Meanwhile, stocks DJIA SPX COMP were mostly lower in afternoon trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
