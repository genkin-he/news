Its users lost too many bets and left for competitors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Shares of FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment were pointing down toward the lowest prices seen in years in early Friday trading, a day after the online sports-betting and iGaming platform's fourth-quarter results disappointed investors in more ways than one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The big problem with the latest quarter seemed to be that FanDuel won too many bets, leaving its users tapped out and unable to bet more. And because the company mistimed offers for free bets, those users went to competitors offering betting deals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"For a management team historically viewed as operationally disciplined, allowing margin optimization to run to the point of impairing customer activity represents a notable lapse in execution,\" Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey wrote in a note to clients. \"This is not simply a sports results issue; it reflects a breakdown in customer lifecycle management during a period of elevated competitive intensity.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the previous quarter, the company reported disappointing sportsbook results due to \"customer-friendly\" sports results for the first two months of the quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The stock (FLUT) dropped 12.8% in premarket trading, putting it on track to open around the lowest prices seen since October 2022. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Separately, CEO Peter Jackson tried to assuage concerns that the prediction-market platform the company launched in December would cannibalize its sports-betting offering, writing in a shareholder letter that, after a comprehensive review, \"we have not identified any evidence of any meaningful impact.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For the latest quarter, the company said that revenue rose 24.9% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, but that missed the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of $4.93 billion. In the U.S., sportsbook revenue jumped 35.4% to $1.5 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Average monthly players in the U.S. increased 5.3% to 4.8 million, while growth in wagers was slower, up 3% to $16.86 billion. The growth in average players was down from 8% in the previous quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Our standard generosity playbook proved less effective in [the fourth quarter] as our investment phasing did not sufficiently align with the pattern of sports results during this period,\" Jackson said, according to an AlphaSense transcript of the postearnings call with analysts. \"As a result, we saw a higher churn within our customer base as a result of loss of market share.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     That's his way of saying the company should've provided more betting deals after their users had lost their money, so they didn't have to leave for other betting platforms. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, fell to $1.74 from $2.94 a year ago, and fell short of the FactSet EPS consensus of $1.85. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Flutter's stock has fallen 54.7% over the past 12 months through Thursday, while shares of rival DraftKings (DKNG) have shed 45% and the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has advanced 17.9%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Tomi Kilgore </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

It plans to implement the change by the end of May. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The shift comes as food makers face renewed scrutiny over additives. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pushed to strip artificial food dyes from Americans' diets as part of the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, which argues synthetic colors and other ingredients contribute to chronic health problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Large manufacturers have already begun adjusting their portfolios. Kraft Heinz has said it plans to remove dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027. Conagra Brands is similarly working to discontinue certain color additives by the end of next year, while Nestle USA has said it aims to eliminate certified food, drug and cosmetic colors from its U.S. food and beverage portfolio by mid-2026. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Retailers are taking part too. Walmart said last fall it would remove synthetic dyes from its store-brand foods and phase out roughly 30 other ingredients, including certain artificial sweeteners and preservatives. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Target has previously sought to position its food assortment around cleaner labels. The retailer in 2019 launched its largest private-label brand, Good &amp; Gather, without synthetic colors, artificial sweeteners and flavors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  The cereal shift is part of a broader effort by Target to sharpen its merchandise assortment and rebuild momentum after several uneven years marked by weaker discretionary spending and operational challenges in stores. The company is investing billions in store remodels, improved inventory systems and e-commerce capabilities as it works to regain shoppers' confidence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  \"We know consumers are increasingly prioritizing healthier lifestyles, and we're moving quickly to evolve our offerings to meet their needs,\" Chief Merchandising Officer Cara Sylvester said. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-370ea3ac=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  February 27, 2026 08:08 ET (13:08 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed Mounts Closed-Door Fight Against DOJ Subpoenas By Vicky Ge Huang </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve is waging a behind-closed-doors legal challenge to a pair of subpoenas issued as part of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, according to people familiar with the matter. As that legal battle ensues, Fed governor Stephen Miran turned his attention to the central bank's policy stance: he said in a Fox Business interview Thursday that the Fed needs to cut rates by about a percentage point this year. Meanwhile, markets will get their next hint on where prices are headed when wholesale inflation data is released Friday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Top News Fed Mounts Closed-Door Fight Against Justice Department Subpoenas </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump, opened a probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to examine whether he gave false testimony to Congress last summer about the central bank's building-renovation project. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The move prompted an unprecedented public response from Powell, who in a Jan. 11 video statement said the investigation was a pretext for President Trump's continuing campaign to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates and end the independence of the central bank. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Fed, in sealed proceedings, is asking a judge to quash the subpoenas , which could reduce or eliminate its obligation to respond. Its specific legal arguments couldn't immediately be learned. It isn't uncommon, especially in high-profile investigations, for a subpoena recipient to challenge prosecutors' demands as being overly broad or seeking information protected by legal privilege. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Fed's Miran Says Four Cuts Are Appropriate This Year </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran said Thursday: \"Four cuts I think are appropriate,\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  adding \"I'd rather get them sooner than later.\" With regard to private credit, Miran said he hasn't seen anything yet that would make him worried from a macroeconomic perspective. He added a lot of the growth in private credit ties back to overregulation in banks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     January's Wholesale Inflation Will Help Flesh Out the Fed's Preferred Price Gauge </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to publish the producer price index for total final demand at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expected that solid price pressures remained in the pipeline in January, though not as strong as in December. That could signal that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge will remain sticky, possibly stalling momentum for further interest-rate cuts. Economists surveyed by FactSet expect that wholesale inflation rose 0.3% in January. That's a cooldown from the 0.5% monthly pace in December, but still a relatively firm monthly print. The annual rate is expected to be 2.6%, a pullback from December's 3% increase.

In response, the entire stock market sold off. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AI disruption makes news almost daily. On Thursday, payments company Block said it was laying off 4,000 employees, 40% of its workforce, because AI has \"changed what it means to build and run a company,\" founder Jack Dorsey told shareholders. \"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Is this just the beginning?

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Problem loans in the financial-services sector imply mounting risks for markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett is worried about problems \"under the hood\" of the U.S. economy </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     An alarm bell has been rung by one of Wall Street's most prominent strategists. Investors ought to be wary of developments in the financial sector, with problem loans increasingly a concern that could trigger a \"proper flush in risk assets\" next month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This stark warning emanates from one of Wall Street's most respected commentators, Bank of America chief equity strategist Michael Hartnett. His weekly flow note alerts investors to watch closely the performance of exchange-traded funds that specialize in bank loans. The panic generated by Jamie Dimon's \"cockroaches\" forewarning last October has never fully dissipated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When bank-loan funds break below the 200-day moving average? \"Bad events.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hartnett highlights two funds in particular that warrant special attention: the State Street BlackRock senior loan ETF SRLN and the State Street Financial Select Sector ETF XLF. So far this year, the former is down just a few percentage points, with the latter dropping about 5%, but Hartnett and team suggest that if respective key support levels for the funds' 200-day moving average at $40 and $52 are broken, that signals \"bad events\" are looming. He cites comparisons with pandemic-era markets and the U.K. pension-fund crisis. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     If the worst comes to pass, Hartnett predicts a big increase in risk aversion in March, a spike in the dollar DXY, with its index hitting 100, and a surge in demand for U.S Treasurys. Hartnett's \"Flow Show\" points out that, already this year, the zero-coupon Treasury-bond ETF ZROZ, which supercharges returns when rates decline, has gained more than 5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     MarketWatch Live: The 10-year Treasury yield is below 4% for the first time since November </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To arrest such a panic, Hartnett speculates that either the Fed would be obliged to ease or the hyperscalers (AMZN) (GOOG) (MSFT) would have to cut back on capital expenditures. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Other troubling indicators are flashing in Asia, Hartnett points out, most notably in Korea, where the KOSPI KR:180721 index has already added more than 50% in 2026. Hartnett compares the bubble here to overbought levels hit by gold (GC00) in January, bitcoin (BTCUSD) in March 2024 and the \"Magnificent Seven\" MAGS in summer 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Hartnett adds that the Nikkei (NIY00) has reached an all-time high, China's currency (USDCNY) is the strongest it's been in three years, and, taken together, this combination suggests Asian assets are front running a global economic boom. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: Yes, consumers in China are consuming again. It's just not their No. 1 priority these days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     KOSPI today as compared with other \"bubble\" peaks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In the short term, Hartnett makes the bold call to \"sell the greed\" in Asia, predicting a correction ahead of trade summits between Donald Trump, the U.S. president, and Japan's prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, on March 19, and China's president, Xi Jinping, on March 31. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     On a longer-term horizon, however, Hartnett is very constructive on the rest of the world, particularly relative to the U.S. At present, U.S. equities SPX RUT constitute 62% of the world's aggregate stock-market capitalization and the rest of the world VXUS makes up just 38%. For Hartnett, clearly, this has to start reversing, especially with the global trends of fiscal excess, populism and the end of deflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     His final point emphasizing this sea change in the investment landscape is that AI disruption is liable to be more disruptive and detrimental to the U.S. services-heavy indices, compared with the more manufacturing- and resource-heavy alternatives in Europe, Australasia, the Far East and emerging markets EEM. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jules Rimmer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     'You could even retire at 55 with $500,000 and be perfectly fine. Am I right?' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Realistically, no one is going to spend $100,000 a year in retirement.\" (Photo subject is a model.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The money people need to save for retirement keeps going up, and I don't like it. I am also very skeptical. Some people say you need $5 million to retire; some say $1 million; others will give a figure anywhere in between. I am highly skeptical about these numbers and wonder what assumptions they're making about how you'll use your money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My grandpa retired at 70 after working as a missionary for most of his life and later at a national laboratory. He hardly earned anything as a missionary. Between his coffeehouse, wife and three kids, it all got spent. He made a lot of money at the lab, but only worked there for about 10 to 15 years before retiring. And now? He's a part-time programmer, landlord and fixes cars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Since the goal of his life was not money, he retired with $750,000 - and he's doing fine. You know why? Because he bought two mobile homes some time ago, and a 2.5-acre lot in the middle of nowhere and started renting them before he retired. In addition to being a landlord, he also had some of his money invested in income stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He finds low-effort ways to make money. He buys an underpriced car, fixes it up, and resells it for a $1,000 profit. He used to run a programming company with my dad. They made a little money, but gained experience. That probably helped him get accepted at the laboratory. Some people even still ask him to reprogram things for them and pay him a few thousand dollars. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Thrift shopping </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He also doesn't spend much. He doesn't own a luxury Tesla; he owns a $5,000 Prius. The only reason he spent more on a car was that my grandma really wanted one that actually worked. The rent from their garage covers their property tax. They don't eat out except on special occasions, like birthdays or holidays, and live a comfortable, low-cost life. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     They take a 30-minute walk every day to stay healthy. My grandma loves shopping a bit too much, but she shops at thrift stores, so their shopping and entertainment expenses remain low. So my grandpa doesn't receive much Social Security, but he makes it work because he uses his money wisely. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The American dream is to make six figures and buy a house. If you have $2.5 million in a money-market account with a 4% return, you get $100,000 a year. Realistically, no one is going to spend $100,000 a year in retirement. The average American spends $78,500 per year. That means, with no interest, $1 million would last about 12 years at that spending rate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Is the problem really how much money we have - or how much we spend? I daresay that if you put your money in the right places and you are careful, you could even retire at 55 with $500,000 and be perfectly fine. Am I right? Of course, it's good to enjoy the fruits of our labor and spend some money on leisure. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Am I missing something big, or were my suspicions right all along? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Skeptical Reader </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Don't miss: 'I spend $7,500 a month': I'm 47, earn $260K, and have $3 million. Can I retire at 50? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To take your retirement-at-55-with-$500,000 scenario at face value would be tough. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dear Skeptical, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I am on #teamgrandpa. He's done a lot right. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     He achieved three valuable things: He worked until he was 70. He found ways to make extra income, which includes renting his mobile homes for extra cash, and keeping his hand in freelance work for his former company, a job that was born from his willingness to take risks and experiment, and by using his assets to make money. And he keeps his costs low. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It would be tough to retire at 55 with $500,000, even though it's a lot of money, although it again depends on your lifestyle and where you live. You would have to take into account healthcare costs, utilities, transportation, rent/mortgage, and property tax.  You could also explore a substantially equal periodic payment plan (SEPP) or employ the Rule of 55. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It would be tough to retire at 55 with $500,000, even though it's a lot of money, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A reminder for readers out there: The \"rule of 55\" is an IRS provision that allows you to take penalty-free withdrawals from your current employer's 401(k) or 403(b) if you leave your job in the year you turn 55 - or later - without incurring a 10% early-withdrawal 10% penalty. SEPPs are IRS-approved, scheduled withdrawals from retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To take your retirement-at-55-with-$500,000 scenario at face value would be tough. That money, all going well with your health, would need to last 35-40 years and inflation would also erode its value over time. Using the 4% rule, that would provide $20,000 per year (or $1,670 per month), especially as Medicare eligibility does not kick in until 65. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your point about whether you need $1 million in retirement, as many surveys suggest - and also point out that $1 million is not enough - is well made. It all depends on your lifestyle, whether your income exceeds your expenses and how much you are willing to cut back in terms of all those extraneous expenses (from coffees and streaming services to eating out). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Related: I'm 80 with $1 million. How do I prevent my son from being hit with inheritance tax? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Retiring at 65 with $1 million </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I have wondered in these pages whether people are squandering their retirement on eating out. All that pizza and spaghetti bolognese add up, as do the extras like drinks, side orders and desserts. Research suggests that people spend anywhere between $1,990 and $2,500 a year on restaurant food - and up to $3,640 on takeout. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In fact, Americans spend almost as much on dining out ($1.5 trillion a year) as they owe in student debt ($1.8 trillion), according to the Department of Agriculture. Total spending on food exceeds $2.63 trillion. Taking those dining-out figures at face value, you would spend $123,750 by 80 if you started counting at 25. Or over $200,000, including takeout. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Americans spend almost as much on dining out as they owe in student debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     So, yes, I'm with your grandpa on this one. He pivoted from missionary work into the corporate sector and made enough money in the latter part of his working life to balance the books in retirement (otherwise known as \"making ends meet\"). That takes creativity, intelligence and gumption, and I'm sure your grandfather has those in spades. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There are other roadblocks and/or forks in the road people face in retirement, including a gradual decline in health, which could lead to the need to live in an assisted-living facility. That too costs money (up to $100,000 a year or more, depending on the facility and location). Without long-term-care insurance, retirees often tap the equity in their homes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Saving, which requires curtailing your spending, is just as critical for a comfortable retirement as investing in a 401(k), IRA or taxable brokerage account. I'm a big fan of shopping at thrift stores. (I just bought a pair of Dr. Martens boots in New York to get me through the snowstorm.) The freedom to travel after 65, if you have the ability, is also a reward for retirement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A healthy retirement fund rewards you with that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More columns from Quentin Fottrell: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Can I stop my kids from using their inheritance to support political causes I vehemently oppose? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     My wife's credit-card payment is three months overdue.
