            "title": "Social Security is hurtling towards insolvency. Could these new proposals help save it in time?",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jessica Hall </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Ideas for reform churn up opposition from advocacy groups </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security provides benefits to about 75 million older adults, people with disabilities and surviving family members. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With Social Security's insolvency looming in about seven years, new proposals are emerging to reform a program that provides benefits for about 75 million Americans - yet the biggest advocacy groups for seniors are balking at many of the suggested changes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     One of the recent suggestions is from the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan policy analysis and research group. It has proposed that the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security should be limited in size for those with the largest benefits and highest lifetime income. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another group, the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a center-left think tank, has made several recommendations - including basing Social Security benefits on the number of years worked, rather than the earnings received over a lifetime. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The proposed reforms come as Social Security recently announced its annual COLA, which will add 2.8% to beneficiaries' benefits starting in January 2026. The COLA, which amounts to an average additional $56 to a beneficiary's monthly check, will be mostly offset by an expected increase in Medicare premiums that are automatically deducted from Social Security payments. Also, the COLA is backward-looking and reflects the inflation in 2025, not the inflationary pressures going forward that older adults still must grapple with. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security needs solutions </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     There's no shortage of ideas to repair the troubled program - and Americans have indicated they would be willing to sacrifice to save it - but so far, no legislative changes have been made. U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut, has been trying to fix Social Security's shortfalls since at least 2015, when he first introduced the Social Security 2100 Act. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: The man who fixed Social Security when it went broke in the '80s has some advice for today's politicians </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     But the clock is ticking. If Congress doesn't act to shore up the program, the trust fund backing Social Security faces insolvency in 2033, at which point the fund would pay out only 77% of scheduled benefits. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Social Security's chief actuary, Karen Glenn, issued a warning in August that the insolvency date could be accelerated because of the Republican tax bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law this summer and included a temporary enhanced tax deduction for older Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Seven years is a lifetime for Congress, but it's not when you're trying to plan your retirement,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. The group plans to offer about a dozen different Social Security ideas over the next year to 18 months to spark discussion and encourage change, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The last time Social Security was overhauled was in the 1980s, but Congress waited until the last minute to address the problems. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If we wait until 2032 to address this, we'll have to make abrupt changes or do some borrowing,\" Goldwein said. \"There are big costs to waiting.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Goldwein said the typical couple would see an $18,400 annual cut to Social Security benefits if nothing is done to address the insolvency issue. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Two proposals, in detail </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the CRFB plan, all beneficiaries would continue to receive a COLA, but there would be a cap that would limit the increase for retirees with the largest benefits and the highest lifetime incomes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Everyone still gets a COLA. It just doesn't go up with income,\" Goldwein said. \"The top quarter tends to have the most wealth outside of Social Security.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     While there will likely need to be a mix of Social Security changes to address insolvency, Goldwein said the COLA cap idea \"is a good arrow to have in your quiver.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the PPI proposal, Social Security would pay benefits based on the number of years a person worked, rather than their earnings over their lifetime. That structure links Social Security's status as an \"earned benefit,\" said Ben Ritz, vice president of policy development and director of the Center for Funding America's Future at the Progressive Policy Institute. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"This keeps Social Security as an earned benefit. Other proposals out there strain that link even further,\" Ritz said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the PPI proposal, anyone who works for at least 20 years would receive a benefit that keeps them out of poverty, in a way that would allow a low-income worker and their higher-wage boss to get the same benefit if they put in the same amount of work. Parents would also receive up to five years of credit for caregiving. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The PPI plan has many components, but some of the other aspects include increasing Social Security's retirement ages to reflect rising life expectancies while still keeping a special early retirement age for lower-earning workers who have not experienced the same gains in longevity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Another PPI measure would change the formula behind the COLA to the chained consumer-price index for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U), rather than the current consumer-price index for urban workers (CPI-W). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Under the PPI proposals, taken together, the people facing the biggest hit financially would be the top one-fifth of the lifetime earners. Those cuts would be on par to the cuts already slated to occur under current law, the group said. The majority of beneficiaries would see no reduction in their monthly benefit, and many low-income or long-career workers would even receive greater benefits, according to the PPI proposal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     PPI said the suggested reforms, taken together, would close half of Social Security's shortfall over the next 30 years while also reducing old-age poverty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The percentage of older adults in poverty rose to 15% in 2024, up from from 14.2% the previous year and representing the highest poverty rate among all age groups, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Advocacy groups on alert </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     AARP over the weekend sent out an email alert to its members about the various proposals, which were presented last week at a CRFB event on novel Social Security and Medicare reforms in Washington. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The last thing we need is D.C. insiders making decisions on our hard-earned money. AARP advocates always stand up to protect Social Security and Medicare, and together we'll fight any idea that puts our money in jeopardy,\" AARP said in the email alert. \"This week's COLA announcement already has some people wondering if they can cover rising costs. The LAST thing Americans 65-plus need is more questions and uncertainty about the Social Security they earned throughout their working lives.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Asked about that email, CRFB's Goldwein said: \"AARP fundraises off of scaring people. They're still at the fundraising stage, rather than the solutions stage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older adults, said it appreciated aspects of the proposals but still feels the best way to close the gap on Social Security insolvency is for wealthier Americans to pay Social Security taxes on all their earnings. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The Progressive Policy Institute's proposal is certainly innovative. We appreciate the fact that they propose a long-term phase of at least 10 years. The Senior Citizens League has long advocated for the longest possible transition period for any changes to Social Security. As with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's proposal, this proposal also does not fix the problem of inadequate COLA,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of the Senior Citizens League. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The Senior Citizens League has recommended that the COLA be based on the CPI-E, or consumer-price index for the elderly, which more closely resembles the goods being bought each month by retired Americans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Overall, the Senior Citizens League supports raising or removing the cap on the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax, known as the taxable maximum. That threshold will increase to $184,500 in 2026, up from $176,100 currently, according to the Social Security Administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"The quickest and most straightforward way to address insolvency is to raise or remove the payroll cap. According to Social Security actuaries, raising the payroll cap to 90% rather than the current 82% would close about one-third of the long-term funding shortfall. Or, eliminating the cap entirely - taxing all earnings - would close around 70% to 75% of the long-term shortfall, depending on details of benefit adjustments,\" Benton said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, another advocacy group, Social Security Works, spoke out against both the CRFB and PPI proposals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Both of these proposals would make enormous cuts to Social Security's modest benefits. They do so by radically changing the system. Currently, Social Security is a defined-benefit pension plan designed to replace wages. The amount you receive is linked to what you earned and what you contributed while working,\" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"CRFB's proposal would weaken the link between earnings and benefits, while PPI's would demolish the link. Both of them are designed to move Social Security towards a poverty-level flat benefit,\" Altman said. \"Instead of trying to scam people out of their hard-earned benefits, we should require millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share into the system.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jessica Hall </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Navy Federal Credit Union said it has seen substantially higher uptake in its Paycheck Assistance Program, which offers zero-interest loans for customers impacted by paycheck disruptions, than it did during the 2018-'19 government shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond organizations for federal employees and military members, several large U.S. banks - including Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citibank (C) - are publicizing new offerings for federal employees or encouraging those impacted by the government shutdown to reach out and inquire about available financial assistance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Several major banks said they have had a significant increase in customers reaching out to request relief. One bank told MarketWatch it has seen a 10% to 15% uptick in mortgage-forbearance requests this month, though it could not say how many were from federal workers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is barreling toward a terrible record. These financial pain points could end it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     These offerings, such as interest-free loans, fee waivers and loan-payment accommodations, can be a lifeline for the 1.4 million federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay. But consumers seeking relief should ask up front about any strings attached and take steps to protect their credit, experts warn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Take the assistance if you need it, but be aware of what the risks are before you do,\" said Alys Cohen, director of federal housing advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. \"Keep really good records and try to get things in writing from the lender and put things in writing yourself, even to confirm a phone call.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Here are four tips to consider before accepting this kind of assistance from your bank or credit union: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read the fine print </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dozens of banks and credit unions are offering assistance for people impacted by the federal shutdown - but the terms of these programs differ widely depending on the financial institution, said Adam Rust, the director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"They're providing relief in different types of scenarios, and it's important to understand exactly what you're signing up for when you take one of these arrangements,\" Rust said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Why Nov. 1 is a make-or-break day for millions of Americans' finances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For example, it's crucial to understand the distinction between zero-interest and accrued-interest programs. A zero-interest program means no interest is charged at all during the relief period, while an accrued-interest program pauses payments but continues adding interest in the background, which you'll still owe later. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     It's essential to get details about the hardship program in writing, as well as contact information for a person at the financial institution who can answer questions. A misunderstanding or violation of the terms can wind up harming a person's credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Avoid the danger of a balloon repayment at the end of a forbearance period </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When money gets tight, many prioritize mortgage payments over credit cards, student loans or personal loans, said Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"Homes right now are a big asset with a lot of home equity for a lot of people,\" said Kates, who is also a certified financial planner. \"That is a huge asset for them to hold on to.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Inflation is quietly chipping away at most Americans' main source of wealth </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Consumers generally can get a full or partial forbearance, a temporary arrangement with a lender that allows them to pause or reduce their mortgage payments due to a financial hardship. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     For those making partial payments, the amount will not count as a full, on-time monthly payment until the total collected equals the full required amount. It can also fall on the consumer to figure out if late fees will be waived during this time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     A big danger that comes with mortgage forbearance is a potential balloon payment - when a lump sum of missed payments is owed at the end of a forbearance period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If you have to pay a balloon payment at the end of the forbearance and you can't afford that, that could put you in a much more difficult situation,\" Cohen said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Luckily, the current standard for many government-backed loans is to extend the term of the mortgage for the number of months missed. For instance, if you missed seven payments during forbearance, the loan is extended by seven months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: A government shutdown would hurt home-buying deals just as buyers are coming off the sidelines </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Keep in mind that interest payments are not paused during the forbearance period, \"but if you're trying to keep your home and stay in your mortgage and you could afford to resume the payments, it's a modest price to pay for getting the forgiveness.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Homeowners also need to stay on top of the forbearance timeline. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"People should find out if they're going to be notified when the forbearance ends or when they have to call to extend it and whether that's on them,\" Cohen said. \"They should have a whole calendar set up so they understand what the timeline is for their arrangement with their lender.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Prioritize the roof over your head - but keep in mind these credit risks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Lenders reporting payments to credit-reporting bureaus typically mark deferred payments for consumers enrolled in hardship programs with a special code indicating \"no information\" or \"deferral,\" which does not hurt their credit. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     However, this is an industry standard rather than legally binding law, so lenders can ignore it, resulting in negative marks for consumers, said Chi Chi Wu, the director of consumer reporting and data advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: This government shutdown could be the longest ever - maybe running until Thanksgiving. What might the economic damage be? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Because the guidance isn't enforceable, a consumer's ability to fix the inaccurate negative credit reporting is limited and difficult. Consumers can be proactive by getting all hardship terms in writing to protect their credit, but the risk remains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Still, Wu said, those facing dire straits due to the shutdown should prioritize essential needs like their mortgage or rent over immediate credit preservation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     \"If your back is against the wall and you don't have enough money to pay all of your bills as a federal worker, pay the bills that are the most important, credit be damned,\" Wu said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Think long term </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     With continuing uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last, Kates said, it's important to map out a plan beyond the relief options offered by your financial institution. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Most programs, like those that allow borrowers to defer a single payment, are designed to offer short-term shutdown assistance and assume the worker's income will stabilize after a few weeks. Many are not built to defer multiple payments or several months' worth of fees. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: The government shutdown is reaching a tipping point that could send the economy into a downward spiral </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To brace for the possibility of a longer-than-expected shutdown, consumers using hardship programs may need to look into secondary resources that can provide a \"backstop,\" he said. \"The job doesn't end by entering one program.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Beyond financial institutions, the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund provides a list of additional resources. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Over a million employees going without pay </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     About 670,000 federal employees are furloughed and 730,000 are working without pay, the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates. If the shutdown extends to December, 4.5 million paychecks will be withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21 billion in missing wages. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Military servicemembers are at risk of going without their first paycheck on Friday, according to the organization, which would be the first time in history that all military members go unpaid due to a shutdown. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The American Bankers Association has compiled a noncomprehensive list of banks of all sizes that are offering relief options for federal employees, which has received 35,000 page views so far, according to the trade group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read more: Are you a federal worker not getting paid during the government shutdown? 4 ways to protect your finances. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     As of Tuesday, 81% of American credit unions were offering deferred payments on existing loans and 71% had launched new or modified relief programs, according to the trade group American Credit Unions.

With 42% margins, you'd expect a richer valuation, but Waystar trades at about seven-times sales - a far cry from bubble territory. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Next, look at the enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) leaders where AI genuinely enhances products, rather than cannibalizing core businesses: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Atlassian (TEAM): Atlassian's growth remains solid - fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.38 billion - and the company is leaning into AI as a core pillar. Its centerpiece is Atlassian Rovo, an AI \"teammate\" introduced in May 2024 that layers search, chat and AI agents across Jira, Confluence and other tools to help teams find information, summarize work and automate workflows. With a base of more than 300,000 customers, deeply embedded products (Jira, Confluence) and a potent AI layer, Atlassian is one of the purer enterprise SaaS AI plays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DocuSign (DOCU): Shares of DocuSign tumbled at the end of September after headlines framed OpenAI's new \"DocuGPT\" as a competitive threat. In reality, DocuGPT was presented as an internal OpenAI agent that converts contracts into structured, searchable data - not an e-signature platform or commercial DocuSign replacement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The selloff overlooked DocuSign's real strength: its entrenched legal-compliance infrastructure, enterprise integrations and a growing Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform that uses AI to analyze and manage contracts end to end. These capabilities are deeply embedded across regulated industries and supported by the company's roughly $900 million in annual free cash flow, allowing continued investment and share repurchases. With AI enhancing - not replacing - its core workflow moat, DocuSign remains one of the most undervalued enterprise automation plays amid AI-driven market confusion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Adobe (ADBE): Adobe reported $6 billion in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up roughly 11% year over year, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.31. The company also noted that its AI-influenced annual recurring revenue surpassed $5 billion, and its generative-AI-model family (Adobe Firefly) has already produced more than 24 billion pieces of content. Despite this, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 - well below its historical 10-year average of 50. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The thesis is brutally simple: These companies boast loyal users, documented time- and cost-savings tools, and deep integration that customers keep paying for regardless of headline volatility. They aren't betting on the farm on AI; they're using it to widen existing competitive moats and improve unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Your bubble-management playbook </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The timeline for maximum disruption in AI runs from the beginning of 2026 until the third quarter of 2027. This is the point when both the AI pilot launches that haven't produced a return on investment and the 2021-2023 AI startups run out of capital. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports that 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024, with the average organization scrapping 46% of AI proof of concepts before production. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates the framework for a slow-motion AI-bubble deflation, rather than a catastrophic burst: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 1 hyperscalers with diversified revenue will weather disappointing AI returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 2 unicorns face valuation compression or acquisition. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -- Tier 3 experiences mass casualties, with a small cohort of survivors demonstrating actual unit economics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The three plays outlined above position investors for this selective deflation: buying Tier 1 quality on 15% to 20% corrections; positioning in data-center infrastructure ahead of verified 2027 constraints; and accumulating profitable companies - whether routine automation or mispriced SaaS - being unfairly sold off alongside failing startups. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The AI bubble is deflating on schedule - but the infrastructure buildout and automation revolution remain genuine opportunities for investors who can distinguish between speculative AI startups burning cash and profitable enterprises solving real problems with measurable returns. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More: These stocks are the real deal for investors in AI - Wall Street is just chasing bubbles </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     -Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  By Jurica Dujmovic </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Everyone's asking the wrong question about an AI bubble. Here are the stocks to buy - and when. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     I've been watching the AI bubble inflate for months now - the unsustainable burn rates, the pilot projects that went nowhere, the startups that couldn't explain their unit economics. So when industry insiders finally started ringing alarm bells, I couldn't resist diving deeper into what's really happening. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     What I found surprised me. Yes, there's an AI bubble. But the viral claim that it's 17-times larger than the dot-com crash is misleading. MacroStrategy Partnership's headline-grabbing analysis measured total capital misallocation across all asset classes, not AI specifically. It seems to me that the math behind the analysis was designed to terrify, not inform. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     More importantly, everyone's asking the wrong question. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The debate shouldn't be whether the AI bubble will pop - that's already happening. Not in some dramatic, market-crushing way that will dominate headlines, but through a slow-motion deflation that's quietly reshaping the entire landscape. The casualties are already piling up: startup shutdowns surged in 2024; in 2025, 95% of enterprise AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact within six months of launch; and down rounds this year hit a decade high at 15.9% of all venture deals. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Many companies that scream the loudest about the bubble are either exaggerating the threat or fundamentally misunderstanding what's actually unfolding. This isn't the 2000 dot-com collapse all over again. It's far more interesting and far more profitable if you know where to look. I've identified three distinct market tiers facing radically different fates: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 1: The hyperscalers (Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)) are essentially unassailable. Their estimated $320 billion to $340 billion in 2025 capex spending - largely for AI and cloud infrastructure - comes from operating cash flow generated by their core businesses. They can weather extended periods of disappointing AI returns because their core businesses print money. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 2: The unicorns in limbo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI) command massive valuations but face existential questions. Can they achieve returns that justify stratospheric valuations? Can they compete against both hyperscalers with infinite resources and substantially cheaper models coming in from overseas? The next 18 to 24 months will separate the winners and losers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Tier 3: Mass casualties are showing up in the numbers. We're seeing more shutdowns (up 26% year over year in 2024), decade-high down rounds in 2025, thinner deal counts and smaller checks, plus enterprises scrapping a big chunk of AI work and failing to get a return on investment (ROI) from pilots. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Expectations are being managed to engineer an orderly deflation rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When Sam Altman openly admits that investors as a whole are overexcited about AI at the same time his OpenAI reaches a valuation of $500 billion, he's not confessing failure - he's managing expectations to engineer an orderly deflation, rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     This creates a rare market asymmetry: The public sees \"bubble\" and flees everything AI-related, while sophisticated capital is making precise bets on deflation survivors. Here are three investment strategies to put you on the winning side of any correction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     1. Buy Tier 1 hyperscalers after the 15% to 20% correction </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     When the next correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Microsoft: Microsoft's AI business is already at a $13 billion annual run rate, up 175% year over year, but most of its money still comes from core products including Azure, Office and Windows. With about $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Microsoft can easily fund its AI buildout without stretching its balance sheet. A pullback in the stock to $400 to $420 would bring the valuation back to around 30-times earnings - right at historical norms and a strong long-term entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Amazon.com: Amazon's cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing about 17.5% year over year, hitting a $123 billion annual run rate. The bulk of Amazon's revenue still comes from retail and e-commerce, giving the company the cash flow and scale to invest heavily in AI infrastructure without jeopardizing its core business. If the shares pulled back 15%, the valuation would drop into the 27- to 30-times-earnings range, offering a potentially compelling entry point. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Alphabet: Internet-search advertising still accounts for roughly 56% of revenue, and for the second quarter of 2025, the company posted an operating margin of 32.4%. Estimated capital expenditures for 2025 are roughly $85?billion, much of which is going into AI and data-center infrastructure, yet Alphabet maintains a strong balance sheet to absorb variable returns. A correction of 15% to 20% would lower the valuation to about 22- to 23-times earnings, potentially offering the best entry within the hyperscaler group. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     DeepSeek's January 2025 reveal triggered a brief panic across AI stocks; hyperscalers slipped 2% to 5%, while AI chip and infrastructure names plunged 15% to 30% before rebounding within days. The takeaway for investors is clear: When the next 15% to 20% correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee - the long-term infrastructure buildout remains intact. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Read: Believe the hype: AI is coming for your job. Plan now. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     2. Invest in data centers before power constraints are a given </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Gartner's November 2024 forecast warns that 40% of AI data centers could face power-availability constraints by 2027, underscoring the physical limits of AI expansion. The firm projects that AI computing workloads alone could consume around 500 terawatt-hours of electricity annually by 2027 - more than two-and-a-half times the 195 TWh used in 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Dominion Energy (D) is ground zero for the AI power crunch. In Virginia - the world's most populous area for data centers - data-center capacity demand has nearly doubled in just five months, jumping from 21 gigawatts under contract to more than 40. These servers already consume a quarter of the state's electricity, and Dominion expects demand to double again by 2039. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     To keep up, Dominion is spending $50 billion over the next five years on new electric-transmission projects and infrastructure upgrades -including an offshore wind project, a solar and battery storage project, and five small modular reactors planned for the 2030s. The stock throws off a 4% to 5% dividend yield, but what really matters is positioning: Dominion isn't just a utility anymore - it's becoming the backbone of the AI era's grid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vistra (VST): Vistra signed a 20-year deal to supply 1,200 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power from its Comanche Peak facility to an investment-grade buyer. It's also adding 860 MW of new gas capacity at its Permian Basin site (boosting it to 1,185 MW) and has outlined up to 2,000 MW of Texas gas additions by 2028 to meet surging data-center and industrial load. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     In addition, data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Digital Realty Trust (DLR): Operates more than 300 data centers globally and has a long record of annual dividend increases. The stock's current dividend yield runs close to 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Equinix (EQIX) operates more than 270 data centers serving in excess of 10,000 customers. Last year, the company marked 85 consecutive quarters of top-line growth and said announced projects were more than 85% leased and preleased as of the first quarter of 2025, underscoring demand from hyperscalers and large enterprises. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Vertiv (VRT): Nvidia (NVDA) last year partnered with Vertiv for AI data-center builds, and Vertiv's stock has soared. The company's valuation is high, but the stock is riding a market that Goldman Sachs sees jumping to $10.6 billion next year, from $4.1 billion in 2023, as liquid cooling reaches 57% of AI servers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Schneider Electric (FR:SU) (SBGSY): This French multinational is a steadier way to play the data-center theme, with a 24% exposure to data-center end markets and 25% fourth-quarter growth in North American energy management on surging AI demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     Conservative investors should build positions in companies poised to profit from the coming power crunch. As AI data centers push grid capacity to its limits, these firms stand to benefit from the multiyear investment cycle required to expand power generation, cooling and infrastructure. With the 2027 constraint window approaching, the next year offers a favorable entry period. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     3. Buy what the market has mispriced </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     The stock market is committing a cardinal error: indiscriminately punishing profitable companies with documented ROI along with speculative AI startups with no path to profitability. This creates two distinct opportunities. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     First, look at companies that solve unglamorous back-office problems through automation. These include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     UiPath (PATH): UiPath boasts 83% gross margins and its solid client base includes giants such as Orange Spain (FR:ORA) (ORANY) and Travis Perkins (UK:TPK) (TPRKY), yet the stock trades at about four-times sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n     BlackLine (BL): Third-party studies show triple-digit ROI from BlackLine's close automation - 234% ROI at Creditsafe (12.4-month payback) and 379% ROI at Red Wing (Nucleus Research). BlackLine returned to GAAP profitability in 2024 and authorized a $200 million share repurchase (later increased by another $200 million). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-602de5d2=\"\">\n  10-31-25 0731ET</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

  KBW's earnings forecasts for the continent's banks assume that rates stay at current levels until 2028, however, another potential 25 basis point cut wouldn't move estimates much given that, as

a third-quarter net profit of 5.52 billion Danish kroner ($855 million), down from 6.17 billion kroner a year earlier, while net interest income fell 1% to 9.07 billion kroner.
