            "description": "Hong Kong authorities have issued a fresh warning against travel to Iran, while at least nine flights to the Middle East from the city have been cancelled or delayed following a joint US-Israeli attack on the country.\nThe warning was issued in response to the United States and Israel launching major air strikes on targets across Iran on Saturday, in what appeared to be one of the most direct and expansive attacks on the country in years.\nHong Kong’s Security Bureau said residents should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel to Iran, including leisure trips.\n“Since late February 2026, tensions in the Middle East have escalated,” the new alert said.\n“The government reminds Hong Kong residents who intend to visit Iran or are already there should exercise caution, attend to personal safety, pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation and notices on consular services from the Chinese embassy [or] consulate-general in Iran.”\n\nHong Kong’s travel alert for Iran has remained at the second-highest level of “red” since August last year, representing a “significant threat” for travellers from the city.\nThe Airport Authority said that at least nine passenger flights at Hong Kong International Airport initially set to depart on Saturday and Sunday were affected by the situation in Iran, and urged travellers to contact their airlines for details.\nA check by the South China Morning Post of the airport’s website showed that Qatar Airways passenger flights QR817 to Doha, EK383 to Dubai and EY871 to Abu Dhabi - all set for departure on Saturday - were cancelled.\nFor Sunday, QR815 and EK381 to Doha and Dubai were also listed as cancelled.\nCathay Pacific Airways’ CX647D to Riyadh and CX731D to Dubai were both rescheduled to 12pm on Sunday, a day later than originally planned.\nAuthorities also said Hong Kong residents in Iran who require assistance could contact the 24-hour hotline of the Immigration Department’s Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit at (852) 1868.\nThe government said it would continue to monitor developments closely.\n",

            "title": "New World reports loss as deleveraging takes priority, dividend suspendedDeveloper keeps dividend suspended, rules out equity fundraising for now as Hong Kong sales rebound.",
            "description": "New World Development posted a net loss of HK$3.73 billion (US$477 million) for the first half of fiscal 2026, as asset write-downs continued to weigh on earnings despite improving Hong Kong home sales and ongoing deleveraging efforts.\nThe loss narrowed 44 per cent year on year for the six months ended December 31, as impairments on investment properties eased and financing and tax expenses related to mainland projects declined, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday. No interim dividend was declared.\n“Our team has worked very hard during this period, leading to ongoing improvements in our operations,” said CEO Echo Huang during the earnings call on Friday.\nHuang said the red ink was mainly attributable to non-cash provisions, including impairments on properties under development and completed units held for sale. She stressed that underlying operations had improved and that “we have achieved good results in improving revenue and reducing costs.”\n\nRevenue fell 50 per cent to HK$8.39 billion, dragged down by weaker construction income and fewer property handovers in mainland China.\n“In 2025, we capitalised on the recovery in Hong Kong’s real estate market to seize new opportunities,” Huang said in the filing. “In a volatile market, our focus is not only on growing our business, but also on the continuous optimisation of our financial structure.”\nDeleveraging remains central to the group’s strategy.\nTotal debt declined by HK$1.7 billion to HK$144.3 billion. However, net debt rose HK$2.6 billion to HK$122.7 billion, with the gearing ratio increasing to 59.7 per cent from 58.1 per cent a year earlier.\nChief financial officer Edward Lau attributed the rise to the accounting treatment of Hong Kong joint ventures, as well as repayments of construction loans tied to those projects.\nManagement has stepped up liquidity measures, including bank refinancing and residential asset sales, raising more than HK$34.8 billion from property disposals since early 2025.\n“When cash flow is stable, we will continue to reduce debt – that’s our topmost goal,” Lau said, adding there were currently no further debt exchange plans.\nAddressing market speculation, Huang said the company had no plans for share placements or rights issues.\nShe added that the group’s seven debt-reduction initiatives were “working”, supported by improving contracted sales and a steady recovery in leasing across its mall and office portfolio. Since early 2025, NWD has raised more than HK$34.8 billion through property disposals and sales.\nHong Kong contracted sales reached HK$10.3 billion in the first half, the highest level since 2021, with the Deep Water Pavilia project 93 per cent sold. More than 1,300 units are scheduled for launch in the second half.\nShares of NWD closed 3.6 per cent higher to HK$10.86 on Friday ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock has gained 49.4 per cent so far this year, as Hong Kong’s housing market shows signs of stabilising.\nHowever, Morgan Stanley gave the embattled developer a “reduce” rating with a target price of HK$6.50, according to a report earlier this month.\nThe results come as its parent, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, faces continued investor scrutiny over its capital allocation and restructuring strategy amid market speculation about potential external investment.\nHong Kong’s property sector remains under pressure from elevated borrowing costs and cautious buyer sentiment, although recent mortgage easing has supported transaction volumes.\nNWD plans to launch about 1,300 units in the next six months, including the low-density luxury project Pavilia Rosa on Rose Street in Kowloon, Grand Austin Bohemian in Tsim Sha Tsui, and Phase 3 of The Pavilia Farm in Tai Wai, which will provide 540 units.\n“Many prospective buyers are shifting their stock market profit into the real estate market,” Huang said.\n",

            "description": "A subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings has accused Panamanian authorities of undermining due process by making an “unnotified intrusion” at a facility storing materials related to ongoing legal proceedings.\nThe Panama Ports Company (PPC) on Friday accused the country’s government of creating a crisis, calling the “illegal takeover” of two port facilities at the Panama Canal a failure to comply with “constitutional, contractual and international obligations”.\nThe former operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports issued a statement a day after Panamanian media reported that local authorities had searched one of the company’s offices. Boxes of documents were seen being taken away during the raid.\nIn a ruling last month, the Panamanian Supreme Court declared that a law approving the ports concession held by PPC was unconstitutional.\nPPC said on Friday that the company and its investors had strongly emphasised to the Panamanian government their objection to the “illegal takeover” of the ports and the “occupation” of its property, which included seizing “proprietary and legally protected information”.\n“PPC also specifically requested the state to establish clear coordination mechanisms regarding access to, custody and protection of its proprietary and privileged information as a private company, including information that is not relevant to the operation of the port operations,” it added.\n“Rather than any form of clarification or coordination of protection mechanisms, the state took even more extreme steps to take the property of PPC [on Thursday] through an unnotified intrusion on a private storage facility with proprietary and material subject to legal privilege compiled in the context of ongoing legal proceedings, demonstrating that the state has undermined due process as part of its takeover.”\n\nThe company also slammed Panamanian authorities for multiple actions that it argued showed a failure to comply with its “constitutional, contractual, and international obligations, including in relation to the protection of investments, due process and legal security”.\nSuch actions included orders by the Panamanian government to stop the operation of terminals at the two ports on Monday, as well as the “intrusive invasion” of PPC facilities, it said.\n“PPC and its investors expressly and continuously reserve all applicable rights related to this crisis generated by the Panamanian state,” the company said.\n\n\n\n\nPanama’s takeover caps a year-long dispute over control of the two ports on the key shipping route, which has become a flashpoint in the geostrategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing.\nUnited States President Donald Trump earlier vowed to “take back” the canal from what he claimed was Chinese control.\nThe dispute also intersected with a separate attempt by CK Hutchison to sell more than 40 ports worldwide in a deal with a consortium led by US asset management giant BlackRock and shipping group MSC.\nThe deal drew Beijing’s ire, and Chinese regulators subsequently launched a comprehensive antitrust review in late March 2025, effectively halting the sale.\nReports also indicated that Beijing sought a greater role for state-owned shipping giant Cosco in any arrangement involving the Panama terminals.\n",

            "title": "Scam-hit Cambodia tries to woo Hong Kong but travel agencies have doubts",
            "description": "The head of Cambodia’s tourism body is looking to build partnerships with Hong Kong travel agencies as part of a drive to get visitors returning to his country, which has been plagued by safety concerns in recent years.\nCambodia Tourism Board CEO Kim Minea also told the South China Morning Post that the government was “determined” to eliminate the notorious scam compounds that had trapped thousands of people, including Hongkongers, in recent years.\nBut Hong Kong tour operators said safety was still a major concern among residents and it would be difficult to draw them back to the Southeast Asian nation in the short term.\nCambodia, famous for the Angkor Wat temple complex, is heavily reliant on tourism, with the sector making up 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024.\nBut tourism statistics showed arrivals to the kingdom were down by about 31.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, compared with a year earlier, coinciding with a border conflict that erupted with neighbouring Thailand last summer.\nHongkongers have avoided Cambodia in recent years following cases of residents becoming trapped in notorious scam centres operated by crime syndicates across the region.\nCambodia’s Ministry of Tourism recorded only 62 arrivals from Hong Kong between January and September last year, while about 889,000 visitors were listed as coming from China. In 2017, by comparison, more than 13,000 Hong Kong residents were counted as having visited.\n\n\nSpeaking to the SCMP on Friday during a visit to Hong Kong, Kim acknowledged that addressing visitors’ safety concerns was a priority.\nHe suggested that the border conflict with Thailand had largely settled since a ceasefire came into effect in December, and that the country’s tourist areas had not been affected by the dispute.\nHe also said that the government was committed to eliminating scam compounds.\nThe government was currently considering a law that would provide a clearer legal framework to clamp down on the illegal activity, while regional authorities had until the end of March to shut down any suspected scam centres in their jurisdictions, he said.\n“From the government, we see a determination to eliminate this [scam compound activity] and prevent it from happening again,” he said. “We have to chase them out of our country but we also have to make sure they won’t come back again.”\nKim said there was also a “huge gap” between the reality on the ground in Cambodia and the impression people got from the news, which his team hoped to address by inviting tour operators to visit the country.\nHis team has a goal of bringing about 500 travel agents from around the world to visit the country this year, roughly 20 per cent of whom are expected to come from China, including Hong Kong and Macau.\nHe said travellers from Hong Kong and other parts of China would be able to visit the country visa-free as part of a pilot scheme running from June to October.\nKim said he believed that Hongkongers would be particularly attracted to the country’s cultural products, food and cheaper luxury goods.\n“So now our team is starting to build relationships with the tourism sector in Hong Kong,” he said.\n“First … to provide an update about Cambodia, particularly [so] that they have more confidence in us in the future. In the future it will be a safe destination.”\nLocal tour operators said there was still a long way to go before Hongkongers would flock back to the country.\nYuen Chun-ning, CEO of the WWPKG travel agency, said safety was still a major concern among Hongkongers and that he did not believe many would consider travelling there in the near future.\nHe said this was especially true as the Japanese yen was still quite weak while tourism was also opening up within the Greater Bay Area – the cluster of cities in southern China, including Hong Kong, that Beijing hopes to develop into an economic powerhouse.\nFrederick Yip, executive director of Goldjoy Travel, said his agency hosted regular tours to Cambodia about 10 years ago, but it was now “very hard” to convince Hongkongers to travel there because of the scam centre issue.\nHongkongers looking to travel to the region had opted for neighbouring countries such as Vietnam instead, he said.\n“Not that Hongkongers aren’t thinking about going [to Cambodia], but it will take time to resume to previous levels,” he said.\n",

            "description": "The average number of aspiring Hong Kong taxi drivers taking a crucial industry test each month has increased by nearly 30 per cent following the launch of a simplified version of the assessment last year, the transport minister has said.\nSecretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan also said on Saturday that the government was increasing the number of dedicated meeting spaces for the city’s five premium taxi fleets at cultural and business landmarks.\n“We streamlined the written test arrangements for taxi drivers last year. The average monthly number of candidates has now risen to around 1,800, representing an increase of nearly 30 per cent compared with previous figures,” she said in a social media post.\n“This continues to inject fresh impetus into the industry, attracting more new entrants. Looking ahead to the new year, we will persist in advancing the pace of reform within the taxi sector.”\nChan earlier said the new test had simplified and reduced questions about locations and routes due to the availability of navigation technology that could assist drivers in quickly finding destinations and planning more efficient routes.\nThe transport chief also said on Saturday that more dedicated spots for app-using passengers of premium fleet taxis to meet would be provided outside the Palace Museum, the M+ museum, the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the airport.\nThe five premium fleets started operating their first batch of taxis last year.\nOn Saturday, Chan also reminded drivers that they would need to start providing at least two electronic payment options from April 1. They should include one method that involved a QR code, such as FPS, and one without, such as credit cards, she said.\nWhile the number of test-takers has increased, the premium fleets struggled last year to meet a government recruitment target.\nThe fleets were estimated to be operating around 1,300 taxis by December, well below the government’s target of 3,500.\nAs of the end of October, about 210,000 people held a taxi driving licence, but only around 46,000 were active.\nThere were around 18,200 taxi driving licence holders aged 40 or below as of last August, representing an increase of more than 50 per cent compared with 2019.\n",

            "description": "Cruise ship calls in Hong Kong may exceed 200 this year, the city’s tourism minister has said, as she revealed that authorities will consider measures to create synergy between the terminal and an emerging cultural hub in Kai Tak.\nSecretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui on Saturday also said cruise ships made 189 port calls in 2025, representing 88 per cent of peak levels, and Chinese vessels might stop in the city this year, which she described as “refreshing news”.\n“It’s been three years since the resumption of travel after Covid, and there is a lag in sailing schedules as they run on a three-year cycle, so I believe we could see cruises that haven’t docked in Hong Kong recently returning or new ones coming here,” she said.\n“We could see more than 200 cruise ships calling in Hong Kong this year.”\n\nWith the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal undergoing an operator tendering exercise, Law suggested the port could explore opportunities to collaborate with the adjacent Runway 1331, a Covid-19 isolation facility-turned-youth hostel and cultural hub.\n“I am aware that Runway 1331 will now operate in synergy with the Kai Tak Sports Park. Could we add the cruise terminal to the mix … whether it’s for food and beverage, youth activities or cultural spaces? … We will announce details when they’re available,” she said.\nVisits by Chinese cruise ships to Hong Kong would “definitely” improve collaboration with the Greater Bay Area, Law said, adding the high-speed railway could also bring passengers from mainland China to Hong Kong.\nThe tender for operating the terminal from June 1, 2028, for a decade was open to interested parties globally and should be concluded this year under the supervision of the Tourism Commission, the minister added.\nLaw stressed that while the current operator, Worldwide Cruise Terminals, had attracted mixed comments over its performance in the past, it had been successful in bringing ships to Hong Kong, barring the interruptions of the Covid years.\nShe noted the terminal could simultaneously accommodate two cruise ships carrying up to 6,000 passengers each, a vessel capacity among the largest in the world.\nTimothy Chui Ting-pong, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the Runway 1331 area could focus further on its role as a youth cultural hub, which would also increase its allure as a tourist attraction.\n“Cruise passengers could have a look at the area before they board and depart. There is no need for another large shopping centre in the neighbourhood, as there are already plenty in Kai Tak,” Chui said.\nHe noted that Runway 1331 intended to become a place where young people could take advantage of opportunities for entrepreneurship, cultural exchanges and talent development, with hostel room leases ranging from days to months.\nThe facility includes amenities such as a performance venue, basketball courts, a waterfront promenade and common spaces, with Chui adding its synergy with the terminal would also hinge on the new operator’s plans.\n",

            "title": "No repeat of Exchange Fund transfer planned in next 5 years, Paul Chan says",
            "description": "Hong Kong does not plan to make another transfer from its Exchange Fund in the next five years, the finance chief has said, citing a new medium-range forecast that explains why the rare move will not be repeated.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po elaborated on his plan on Saturday, after his budget announcement that he would withdraw HK$150 billion (US$19.2 billion) from the government’s main investment arm and de facto sovereign wealth fund sparked concerns about the city’s financial stability.\n“In the entire medium-range forecast, apart from the HK$150 billion transfer over the two years just mentioned, there are actually no other transfers projected,” Chan told a radio programme. “I will not make this a normal practice.”\nHis assurances follow Wednesday’s budget announcement that the government would withdraw HK$75 billion annually for two years from the Exchange Fund’s investment income to top up the Capital Works Reserve Fund.\nThe move, justified by the Exchange Fund’s record-high investment income of HK$330 billion last year, aims to support the Northern Metropolis and other infrastructure projects.\nChan argued that with the fund’s total assets exceeding HK$4.1 trillion, the transfer represented only about half of last year’s investment gains and would not undermine the city’s financial stability or its ability to defend the currency peg.\n“We took into account the large size of the Exchange Fund,” he said, emphasising that the funds were being reallocated from financial investments to infrastructure projects that would eventually generate tax and economic returns.\n\n\nBut the unprecedented move has raised eyebrows among financial conservatives. Experts have cautioned that making such withdrawals a regular practice could undermine the city’s long-held reputation for financial prudence.\nAddressing the financing of the Northern Metropolis, Chan disclosed a shift in the government’s bond issuance strategy.\nWhile the administration had traditionally favoured short-term debt to take advantage of lower interest rates, it would now increase the proportion of longer-term bonds, he said.\nHe also said that going forward, the government would explore issuing a greater proportion of long-term bonds to better align cash flow with infrastructure investments in the megaproject.\nHe noted that infrastructure projects had long gestation periods before generating revenue, making long-term debt a more prudent way to align assets and liabilities.\nThe government forecast its level of debt-to-gross domestic product would rise from the current 14.4 per cent to about 19.9 per cent over the next five years, a level Chan insisted remained “relatively low” by international standards.\nChan also outlined a more hands-on government role in driving private sector development within the metropolis.\nMoving beyond the traditional “highest bidder wins” land sale model, authorities would actively partner with private developers holding land banks and with technology enterprises seeking to establish footholds in the city, he said.\n“We encourage developers who have land to come to the government if they have looked for tech enterprises or advanced manufacturing firms,” Chan said.\nHe added that the government was prepared to facilitate land tenders or even co-invest in projects to speed up development.\n\nThe approach marks a significant departure from the government’s traditional laissez-faire stance towards land development. It is also considered a signal of a more interventionist industrial policy as the city strives to catch up in terms of innovation.\nDonald Low, professor of practice in public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said that while tapping financial reserves to fund infrastructure projects was a common and cost-effective strategy globally, it carried the risk of eroding financial discipline by bypassing market scrutiny.\n“Unlike borrowing from the market, drawing from reserves doesn’t naturally impose any discipline on the government,” he said.\n“With borrowing, the market serves as a disciplining mechanism. With drawing from reserves, there’s no disciplining mechanism other than the government itself.”\nLow also expressed concerns about the government’s future financial discipline.\n“The main concern with these drawdowns is that, over time, the government may become less disciplined and more reliant on its reserves as a cheap source of financing,” he added.\n“Who decides whether the project that is to be financed from reserves is something that generates a positive return over the long term?”\nLow argued that Chan’s personal assurances were insufficient without institutional safeguards, noting Hong Kong lacked the formal constraints of other jurisdictions that prevented excessive drawdowns by future administrations.\n“There’s no formal rule that limits or constrains how much the government of the day can draw from reserves accumulated over many years,” he said.\n“Singapore, for instance, has a ‘two-key’ rule that requires the government to obtain both parliamentary and presidential approvals for any drawdown from past reserves.”\n",

            "title": "Commercial EV use needs boost after car owner tax break ends, green groups say",
            "description": "Hong Kong environmental groups have urged the government to focus on accelerating the commercial use of electric vehicles and enhancing green infrastructure, after scrapping a tax concession scheme for private cars that has cost HK$30 billion over the past decade.\nGreen groups said on Friday that they supported the government’s decision to end the first registration tax (FRT) concessions for private electric cars, including the “One-for-One Replacement Scheme”. The move was announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in his budget address on Wednesday.\nThe scheme offers car owners a higher FRT concession of up to HK$172,500 (US$22,056) when they scrap and deregister an eligible older private car in exchange for a new electric vehicle (EV) purchase.\nChan said in his address that about 70 per cent of newly registered cars in Hong Kong were EVs and the need for the concession no longer existed.\n“From a modest variety of electric vehicles with higher prices to a larger variety of models with heightened comfort and better features, and a steady drop in prices, we believe electric cars have become competitive enough,” he said.\nIn response to queries from the South China Morning Post, the Transport Department revealed that more than 128,000 vehicles had received the tax incentives since 2018.\n\nAs of the end of December 2025, Hong Kong had about 149,000 EVs, or about 16.3 per cent of the total number of vehicles in the city, the department said.\nFigures from the Environment and Ecology Bureau this month showed that the government had waived more than HK$30 billion over the past decade through first registration tax concessions, including the one-for-one scheme.\nAround 140,000 of the EVs were private, with the growth in recent years attributed to significant improvements in factors such as price, charging infrastructure, models and performance, the bureau said.\nThe bureau projected that the number of private EVs could exceed 290,000 by 2030.\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, the waiver scheme for commercial vehicles, which ends in March 2028, has only accumulated HK$100 million over the past decade.\nLast year, the penetration rate for electric commercial vehicles was only around 19 per cent, compared with 70 per cent for private vehicles.\nCurrently, just 0.5 per cent of the 18,000 licensed taxis are electric while only 1.4 per cent of the more than 6,000 buses owned by four operators were e-buses as of October 2024.\nSteven Chan Wing-kit, assistant environmental affairs manager at The Green Earth, said it was a “pity” that the government decided to end the scheme, although he agreed that the market for private EVs was now much more mature.\nHe noted that the penetration rate of commercial EVs was still very low and suggested that the government could pivot its efforts to help businesses transition.\n“If we want to continue promoting electric vehicles, we should focus subsidies on commercial vehicles, as the penetration rate of electric commercial vehicles is far lower than that of private cars,” Chan said.\n“Since commercial vehicles travel much longer distances, electrification would further reduce roadside air pollution.”\n\nThink tank Civic Exchange said it welcomed the decision to stop extending the FRT concession for private EVs.\nExecutive director Lawrence Iu said that although the scheme had encouraged car owners to switch to EVs, the number of private vehicles on the road had ultimately increased by more than 2 per cent from 565,213 in 2018 to 578,001 in 2024.\nHe said that promoting the use of EVs for commercial purposes would be a crucial move in reducing carbon emissions.\n“Challenges faced by commercial electric vehicles include the limited availability of charging infrastructure and the high cost of electric vehicles,” he said.\n“But the government is taking steps to address these challenges, such as investing in green corridors and promoting the use of electric vehicles for commercial purposes.”\nPointing to the United Kingdom as an example, Iu said the government could tax EV users through modest mileage-based charging to provide a fair road-use contribution framework while maintaining clean mobility incentives.\nJeffrey Hung Oi-shing, chief policy research officer at Friends of the Earth, said that to achieve Hong Kong’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, more resources should be allocated to commercial vehicles and public transport.\n“Commercial vehicles play a significant role in pollution and roadside carbon emissions,” he said.\n“The focus should be on improving the infrastructure, such as charging facilities, to support the growth of electric commercial vehicles.”\nHung also urged the government to cooperate with mainland China to introduce more electric commercial vehicles to the Hong Kong market.\nIu noted that the government had been stepping up efforts to support taxi and public transport operators to switch to electric alternatives.\n“Ultimately, they should encourage more people to switch to public transport,” he said.\nHung suggested that the government improve planning in new town developments and invest in greener transport infrastructure.\n“Better road connectivity, bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure would encourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport for their last-mile commute, like many other international cities in the world,” he said.\n",

            "description": "Corporate volunteers from Hong Kong’s Chinachem Group joined children with special educational needs for a mochi-making workshop held ahead of Chinese New Year, as part of the company’s annual charity campaign.\nThe workshop, held in partnership with the charity TREATS, brought participants together to make traditional festive food. TREATS is among the beneficiaries of Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual fundraising campaign jointly organised by the South China Morning Post and RTHK.\nAmy Wu, director of corporate communications at Chinachem Group, said the session reflected the company’s commitment to giving back to the community.\n\n“At Chinachem Group, we create people‑centred places that connect people with their surroundings, and foster belonging, inclusion and shared purpose,” she said. “This closely aligns with the OSC theme of building bridges.\nThe workshop is part of Chinachem Group’s ongoing support for the annual fundraiser. Since 2021, the Group has helped the campaign bring businesses and communities together, turning goodwill into tangible action.\nThrough the initiative, staff volunteers have partnered with NGOs and beneficiaries to reach people who might otherwise receive less support, helping to strengthen social ties across Hong Kong.\n\nHands-on activities like the mochi-making workshop hold special meaning for the group.\n“They bring corporate volunteers and children with educational needs together in a joyful, structured setting, fostering empathy, confidence and communication skills on both sides,” Wu said.\n“It helps break down social barriers, and this is the kind of volunteering that reflects our values of Care, Contribute and Grow.”\nWu said the group extends this spirit of care to people with diverse needs by supporting dance sessions for individuals living with Parkinson’s, football training for children with autism and ballet classes for young people from underprivileged backgrounds.\n\nAt the same time, the group continued to invest deeply in its neighbouring communities of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing, aiming to strengthen long-term connections and create meaningful, place-based impact, she added.\nChinachem Group collaborates with partner organisations to conduct regular home visits to elderly residents living alone or in pairs in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing. It also activates its own spaces, such as shopping centres, as community hubs and gathering points for public use.\nWu also said that family sports sessions, such as pickleball classes and group walks or runs along nearby trails and the waterfront, were also organised to encourage people of all ages to stay active and connect with their surroundings.\n\nWu described these efforts as placemaking, creating neighbourhoods where people feel connected, supported and proud to belong.\n“In Tsuen Wan, we focus on understanding local needs and co‑designing programmes with community partners to ensure our initiatives remain relevant as demographics and neighbourhood dynamics evolve,” she said.\n“All these steps support our aim of creating ‘Places With Heart’, places where people of all ages and backgrounds can connect and truly feel part of the community.”\nOSC has raised around HK$396 million (US$50.6 million) for more than 365 charitable projects and helped more than 100,000 people since it was officially launched by the SCMP and RTHK in 1988.\nFind out more about OSC here.\n",

            "title": "Some Hong Kong landlords spend millions fixing subdivided flats ahead of new law",
            "description": "Some Hong Kong landlords have spent millions renovating their subdivided flats to be among the first to meet the new standards coming into effect on March 1, but many others remain taken aback by the high costs and are unsure whether to proceed.\nBuilding experts have also warned of the challenges facing landlords seeking certification under the new law, including meeting waterproofing and fire safety requirements, which will require professional advice and supervision.\nMatthew Lau Chi-kwong, a landlord operating more than 500 subdivided homes across over 50 whole flats, is among the first to rectify his properties.\n“My stock is too big. I have to follow the government policy … However, I will not rush to rectify all of them to stay flexible,” he said.\nLau has spent around HK$2 million (US$255,672) to upgrade 20 standard flats by merging smaller units and installing windows, among other works. One project involved converting a flat of more than 1,000 sq ft in Happy Valley into four subdivided homes, each renting for about HK$13,000 per month.\n\n\nThe Basic Housing Units Ordinance stipulates that only subdivided homes that meet minimum standards and are certified by building professionals can be legally leased. Those failing to comply face a maximum fine of HK$300,000 and three years’ imprisonment.\nCertified properties, or “basic housing units”, must measure at least 86 sq ft, have a ceiling height of 2.3 metres (7.5 feet), proper windows and at least one toilet per unit, among other requirements. Certificates must be renewed every five years.\nFrom March 1, landlords can apply for certification, or they have a year to register for a grace period granting them until February 2030 to complete the required rectifications while continuing to lease their properties legally.\nLau said he would apply for the grace period to maximise rental returns but would take his time renovating the rest of his portfolio, as some projects could cost up to HK$400,000 per standard flat.\n“I would rather return them to the owners, or I can turn them into storage space for rental profits,” he said, adding that some could also be converted into bed-space dormitories with shared toilets and kitchens, which are not subject to the new ordinance.\nLau said he still saw ongoing business potential in the basic housing market, citing increasing demand from mainland Chinese students and professionals who preferred renting to buying as well as from local residents priced out of home ownership.\n“For qualified subdivided homes, the rent will not drop but increase. Those with good qualities can have their rent increased by 10 to 20 per cent,” he said.\nSonny Fung, who manages around 100 subdivided flats of 100 and 120 sq ft each, also sees an opportunity to profit from local tenants and imported workers.\nHowever, he expressed doubt about consistent returns from non-local students, some of whom view Hong Kong merely as a stepping stone.\n\nFung said his flats were already relatively spacious and well equipped, meaning he only needed to spend about HK$30,000 installing fire doors and safety equipment for three to four subdivided units within each standard flat.\nHe added that this was far lower than the general estimate of at least HK$120,000 for units requiring full rectification, including space rearrangement, toilet repairs and basic amenities.\nFung, who plans to expand his business to 500 basic housing units, said he believed that large-scale operators would dominate the future market due to their stronger resources and capital.\n“I estimate that it can take over a year to recover the renovation cost of a flat, as salaries go up and materials aren’t cheap either,” he said.\n“Many landlords are doing their calculations. They have earned much and they do not want to take risks.”\n\n\nComhome Social Realty, a social enterprise specialising in subdivided housing rental services, said it had begun receiving inquiries since January from landlords owning only a few subdivided homes in one flat.\n“Generally, owners are adopting a wait-and-see approach to the new law’s execution, as well as other owners’ responses. They tend to apply for the grace period first,” Comhome director Chan Tsz-hei said.\nHe added that many landlords were unaware of specific requirements, such as the installation of official water meters, waterproof toilets and a sink located outside the bathroom.\n“Some owners have said they may quit the market if the rectification cost is too high,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nApart from renovation work, landlords must also hire professionals for certification. Robin Leung Chi-tim, the immediate past president of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, said certification alone could cost at least HK$15,000 per subdivided home, depending on its complexity.\nHe warned of possible hidden costs, citing water leakage as an example.\n“It takes time to conduct waterproof tests and requires cooperation from the flat underneath,” he said.\n“Upon discovering water leakage, we have to resolve the issue. It is not an easy task, as we have to look for the origin, which can be the floor, the wall or the drain … Each of them has different tests.”\nLeung also noted that verifying the fire resistance of fire safety doors could be difficult if landlords failed to provide the necessary certificates.\n“We would encourage landlords to hire registered professionals for design and planning, as well as work supervision, to save their costs in the long run. After all, they have to be certified again five years later,” he said.\n",

            "title": "The big cornerstone comeback: what’s driving investors back to Hong Kong IPOs?",
            "description": "Until last year, Fidelity International’s most significant cornerstone commitments on the Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) market dated back to 2021, when Chinese short-video platform Kuaishou Technology raised US$5.4 billion and healthcare firm Medlive Technology completed a US$543.4 million listing.\nThen for the next four years, the asset manager went quiet.\nLate last year it returned to Chinese assets in force. It backed gold miner Zijin Gold International’s US$3.2 billion listing in September 2025, followed by crypto platform HashKey Group, snack retailer Busy Ming and pork giant Muyuan Foods.\nFidelity’s comeback is not an isolated case.\nHeavyweight global investors such as BlackRock, Temasek and Qatar Investment Authority are reappearing in cornerstone books, signalling a shift in sentiment – and raising the question of what has changed in Hong Kong’s favour.\n“We have seen a robust comeback of international long-only investors – especially European and Middle Eastern sovereign funds – in Hong Kong’s IPO market, and we expect that momentum to carry into 2026,” said John Lee, vice-chairman and head of Greater China for global banking at UBS.\nThe return is not limited to Europe and the Middle East, with US and Singapore-based funds also re-emerging as cornerstone backers in major listings, particularly across consumption, industrial and hi-tech sectors.\n\n\n“In 2023 and 2024, many international investors reduced China exposure altogether,” Lee said. “But the tone has definitely changed over the past 12 to 18 months, with a gradual return of investors adding back China weightings – a trend that became more pronounced by the middle of 2025.”\nThe shift has been supported by improving sentiment towards consumption, clearer policy direction in technology and industrial upgrading, and growing confidence in the global competitiveness of Chinese companies, particularly in artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, he added.\nHong Kong’s equity market delivered its strongest annual gains since 2017 last year, supported by improved liquidity and renewed risk appetite. Benchmarks outpaced several major developed-market indices, while valuations remained well below those of US peers.\nFor investors such as Fidelity International, the move reflects a strong recalibration of risk appetite.\n“The Hong Kong IPO market today feels more anchored by companies listing for longer-term strategic reasons rather than short-term fundraising considerations,” said Tina Tian, portfolio manager at Fidelity International.\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, it felt like the right time to re-engage with Hong Kong, she added, noting that from both an issuer and investor perspective the quality and structure of the IPO pipeline had improved materially.\n“As global regulatory and geopolitical dynamics evolved, a Hong Kong IPO or secondary listing is increasingly seen as a way to broaden the investor base, enhance liquidity and maintain access to international capital within a familiar regulatory framework,” Tian said.\nThe cornerstone investor has long been a steady feature of Hong Kong’s IPO market, offering much-needed ballast to a market prone to sharp swings.\nWith early commitments to buy sizeable stakes and lock-up periods after listing, cornerstone funds anchor pricing, signal confidence and help stabilise deals before trading begins.\nForeign capital accounted for about 27 per cent of all 353 cornerstone investors across the top 20 IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year, according to data compiled by the SCMP.\nTheir presence has grown not only in headcount but also in investment size, with commitments noticeably larger than in 2022.\n“Large scale US funds are leaning into China’s consumption, infrastructure and industrial sectors,” a shift away from their earlier preference for property developers, said George Wu, partner at global law firm DLA Piper.\nThe contrast in cornerstone investor profiles between recent and older deals is stark.\nWhen China Tourism Group Duty Free raised US$2.3 billion in August 2022, the year’s largest IPO in Hong Kong, its cornerstone line-up was dominated by state-backed funds, including China State-owned Enterprise Mixed Ownership Reform Fund and China Structural Reform Fund.\nFast forward to last year, and the names tell a different story.\nMainland Chinese soft drink maker Eastroc Beverage, which raised US$1.3 billion in the city’s largest IPO as of February 3, drew 16 cornerstone investors, including six global heavyweights such as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority – the single largest cornerstone investor with US$150 million – alongside Temasek, BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan Asset Management.\nBlackRock put US$35 million into snack retailer Busy Ming. In industrials, Oaktree and Jane Street joined BlackRock in backing machinery maker Sany Heavy Industry, while Jane Street also took a cornerstone stake in air-conditioning components supplier Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls.\nMiddle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have been among the most active backers of China’s cutting-edge technology listings.\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority was the largest cornerstone investor in AI start-up MiniMax with a US$65 million commitment and also led the cornerstone line-up in Shenzhen Edge Medical with US$15 million.\nKuwait Investment Authority ranked among the biggest cornerstone investors in battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, pledging US$500 million.\n“The direction of private capital flows is driven mainly by financial returns,” Wu said. “But in certain sensitive tech areas, geopolitical and national security concerns inevitably discourage some investors from taking action.”\n\n\n\n\nM&amp;G Investments, the London-based asset manager, was involved last year in the listings of logistics firm Jingdong Industrials and bubble tea chain Mixue Group as a cornerstone investor.\n“Our intention is to be long-term shareholders from the outset,” said Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M&amp;G Investments.\n“We see compelling opportunities in several areas: the renewables supply chain, scaled franchise-driven business models expanding domestically and internationally, technology platforms and logistics companies.\n“The common characteristics across these sectors are wide competitive moats, improving unit economics, robust balance sheets, long growth runways and valuations that remain discounted relative to global peers.”\nThe share of IPO proceeds locked up by cornerstone investors also climbed between 2021 and 2026, with the portion of total funds rising to roughly 49 per cent from about 14 per cent, according to LSEG Data &amp; Analytics data.\nMore than 270 global institutions acted as cornerstone investors in Hong Kong IPOs last year, while 40 listings included at least one international cornerstone backer, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) data showed.\nSo far in 2026, cornerstone tranches have accounted for around half of the US$1.81 billion raised across 11 Hong Kong IPOs.\nFor many global long-only investors, the renewed participation as cornerstone investors marks a clear break from the years when exposure to Chinese equities – and Hong Kong IPOs in particular – was sharply reduced or frozen altogether.\n“That said, state-linked capital helped companies bridge a difficult funding period and reach the IPO stage,” Wu said. “At the same time, local governments were advancing industrial upgrading amid property downturn and sluggish consumption, and companies urgently needed capital between 2022 and 2024. It was a very reasonable match.”\n“The direction of Chinese government capital flows is about supporting local industries, promoting employment and creating local social and economic value,” he added.\nGovernment-backed entities made up about 18 per cent of all cornerstone investors across the largest IPOs of 2025 and those priced up to February 3, this year.\nWhile Chinese government-linked investment vehicles have scaled back their overall share of cornerstone allocations during 2022 and 2024, they continue to anchor the country’s strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric vehicles and new energy.\nAnalysts said their holdings underscored China’s push to shift away from property-driven growth towards new economic engines.\nSeveral semiconductor and biotech deals this year saw meaningful government participation. For instance, cornerstone investors in OmniVision Integrated Circuits, GigaDevice Semiconductor and Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor all included state-linked funds.\nWhile state backing has supported demand in strategic sectors, the broader revival in cornerstone activity has been driven by the return of international investors alongside reforms introduced by Hong Kong’s bourse operator.\nHKEX, which runs Asia’s third-largest stock market with a capitalisation of about US$6.5 trillion, has in recent years introduced a series of listing changes aimed at widening the pipeline of issuers and expanding the base of institutional investors.\n\n\nIts IPO allocation overhaul, effective August 4, guaranteed institutional investors at least 40 per cent of new shares through the bookbuilding tranche while cutting the potential clawback to the retail subscription pool to 35 per cent from 50 per cent under the old rules, a move aimed at reducing volatility in debut trading.\nThe growing prevalence of so-called A+H listings and “return-to-Hong Kong” transactions has also meant that investors are increasingly engaging with companies that are already well researched and subject to regulatory oversight in other major markets, helping to rebuild confidence in deal quality.\nThat shift has been reinforced by changes to the listing regime. Since 2018, HKEX has introduced Chapter 18A and, more recently, Chapter 18C to accommodate pre-revenue biotech and specialist technology companies, widening the pipeline of issuers and drawing fresh pools of capital.\nJohnson Chui, managing director and head of global issuer services at HKEX, said the increasingly diverse mix of participants in IPOs reflected investor confidence in Hong Kong as a resilient and internationally competitive capital-raising venue.\n“HKEX will continue to enhance its attractiveness to global investors,” he said.\nAccording to Peihao Huang, head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan, cornerstone investors were essential to issuers and banks in setting valuation parameters, identifying opinion-leading institutions and reducing execution risk and helping build momentum during book-building.\nShe added that the presence of well-known international cornerstone investors often strengthened demand from other institutional and retail investors, as their participation was widely viewed as a validation of deal quality and valuation discipline.\n“Cornerstone participation has always been a defining feature of Hong Kong IPOs, but in this cycle it has become the new norm,” she said.\n",

            "description": "Chinese chip designers from Cambricon Technologies and Moore Threads Technology to MetaX Integrated Circuits posted stellar earnings on Friday, driven by growing demand for domestic semiconductors amid Beijing’s tech-sufficiency push.\nBeijing-based Cambricon, seen as a local alternative to US chip giant Nvidia, reported a net profit of 2.06 billion yuan (US$301 million) for 2025, its first full-year profit since listing in 2020, according to a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\nRevenue for the year rose 450 per cent to 6.5 billion yuan from a year earlier.\nThe company credited the revenue growth to the competitiveness of its chip products, which lifted its market share amid rising demand for artificial intelligence computing resources that support AI adoption across diverse business scenarios.\nCambricon’s shares closed 0.8 per cent higher at 1,178 yuan.\n\nMoore Threads and MetaX reported annual revenues of 1.5 billion yuan and 1.6 billion yuan for 2025, up 243 per cent and 121 per cent year on year, respectively.\nBoth companies reported annual losses but narrowed them on the back of strong product demand.\nMoore Threads narrowed its annual loss by 36.7 per cent to 1.02 billion yuan, thanks to “market recognition of its products” amid the country’s AI boom, the company said in its earnings statement to the Shanghai exchange. MetaX narrowed its annual loss by nearly 44 per cent to 781 million from a year earlier.\nMoore Threads’ shares closed flat at 608.30 yuan, while MetaX’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to 535.62 yuan.\nMeanwhile, Zhongji Innolight, a telecom-equipment maker, reported a 60 per cent increase in revenue last year to 38.2 billion yuan, while profit surged 108 per cent to 10.8 billion yuan, supported by its clients’ investments in AI infrastructure equipment.\nEarlier this week, a slew of Chinese tech firms, from semiconductor designer Hygon Information Technology and foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor to supercomputer maker Sugon, reported rising revenue on domestic demand for home-grown computing systems.\nHygon posted a 57 per cent jump in annual revenue to 14.4 billion yuan and a 32 per cent increase in profit to 2.54 billion yuan last year, attributing the results to a “continued rise in demand for domestically produced high-end chips”.\nSugon, a maker of high-performance computing systems and Hygon’s largest shareholder, saw revenue rise 13.9 per cent year on year to 14.97 billion yuan last year, while net profit increased 10.5 per cent to 2.11 billion yuan.\nChinese foundry Hua Hong reported record revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025, reaching US$660 million, up 22.4 per cent from a year earlier.\nTheir rising sales came as Beijing has yet to approve the sale of Nvidia’s highly sought-after H200 chips, leaving local firms, which are racing to embrace AI across their organisations for efficiency gain, scrambling to adopt domestic alternatives.\nAt its recent earnings call, Nvidia said it had yet to generate any revenue from its H200 chips in China. It said it did not know if any sales would be allowed in the country, after posting record quarterly revenue on surging demand for its data centre processors.\n",

            "title": "Breakthrough or hype? How WeRide aims to edge rivals in crowded robotaxi field",
            "description": "WeRide, one of China’s big three robotaxi companies, has cut research and development (R&amp;D) costs by “millions” of US dollars by using artificial intelligence to train its fleet in virtual worlds, its CEO said.\nWhile rivals had also developed AI models simulating the physical world, WeRide’s efforts stood out as it was using its world model Genesis to support its global expansion strategy, said Tony Han.\n“It’s the first real marriage between physical AI and generative AI,” Han told the South China Morning Post.\nA major challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry has been the high costs associated with developing self-driving algorithms that can generalise across different markets and terrains.\nIn particular, the low tolerance for accidents has meant algorithms must be trained on many low-probability “edge cases” that occur in the real world, as shown by a recent incident in the US where a Waymo robotaxi drove passengers into a police stand-off.\n\nThis has pushed many of the industry’s leading players, including Waymo and Tesla, to turn to AI world models as they seek to reduce unit costs to drive fleet expansion.\nIn China, Guangzhou-based WeRide and crosstown rival Pony.ai have both emphasised their world model efforts in recent months, as they look to keep up with Baidu’s Apollo Go, the domestic leader by fleet size.\nHan said Genesis had allowed WeRide to test new self-driving algorithms in a matter of days in a virtual world, where previously the same tests would have required hundreds of cars operating in the real world for months.\nCrucially, Genesis enables WeRide engineers to simulate rare edge cases that are key to ensuring self-driving safety yet difficult to capture in the real world.\nThis had resulted in a reduction of at least 75 per cent in WeRide’s data labelling and collection costs, Han said, adding that such costs made up a large percentage of the company’s R&amp;D spending – around 316 million yuan (US$46 million) in the third quarter of 2025, or around 73 per cent of total operating expenses.\nHan said Genesis was almost entirely the result of advancements in generative AI technology in recent years. The company’s early experiments with physical world simulations had been rudimentary, with cars and pedestrians represented by Roblox-like blocks, limiting practical usefulness.\nThis changed as generative AI, which uses machine learning to create models of its underlying datasets, made virtual worlds increasingly accurate depictions of the real world.\n\nWeRide trained Genesis using billions of kilometres of real-world driving data collected by the company, including more than eight years of real-world edge cases. Its powerful capabilities mean WeRide could sell the model as a stand-alone product in future – a long-standing “dream” for Han, a former chief scientist of autonomous driving at Baidu.\nHan said limits on access to computational power, more than rising graphics processing unit (GPU) prices, were now the main obstacle to continued improvement, given the clear upside of investment in this area for WeRide’s bottom line.\n“Every dollar we spend improving Genesis leads to 10 times more R&amp;D efficiency, because it’s less spent on road testing and recruiting data labourers,” he said, adding they were now “probably” doubling their GPU stock every quarter. “The constraint is the shortage of memory and availability of certain advanced GPUs.”\nWith the help of AI, WeRide aims to ramp up its global fleet from around 1,000 today to up to 3,000 robotaxis by the end of this year.\nHowever, investors have shown concern for WeRide’s future in a crowded field. Apollo Go and Pony.ai aside, Chinese start-ups such as AutoX and Momenta have also recently expanded pilot programmes, while Volkswagen announced this week its plans to launch its first robotaxi fleet in the US.\nSince its November listing, WeRide’s Hong Kong shares have fallen more than 20 per cent, while its Nasdaq shares have slumped almost 70 per cent in the past year. Analysts have highlighted the company’s continued R&amp;D-driven losses as a point of concern, with profitability not expected until 2030.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Genesis will give WeRide an edge over rivals, with Pony.ai recently touting that its world model PonyWorld generates 10 billion kilometres for testing each week.\nLeading US player Waymo also unveiled its world model earlier this month, built on Google DeepMind’s most powerful world model Genie 3. It said the collaboration with its fellow Alphabet subsidiary gave its model an edge over others in the autonomous vehicle industry, as Genie 3 was trained on a huge number of videos and not just real-world driving data.\nBeyond technical indicators, Han pointed to WeRide’s aggressive global expansion strategy as a differentiator from its competitors, as the strategy could be further enhanced with a powerful world model even if it was not industry-leading.\nWhile WeRide still lags far behind Baidu’s Apollo Go in domestic deployment, the company has already expanded to more than 40 cities across 11 countries and regions, one of the highest in the world, compared with eight for Pony.ai and three for Waymo.\nThe company struck a deal last year with Grab, the largest ride-hailing app in Southeast Asia, and announced a major expansion of its partnership with Uber earlier this month to deploy at least 1,200 robotaxis across the Middle East as soon as 2027.\nMeanwhile, Baidu said on Thursday that Apollo Go had reached 26 cities globally.\n“Genesis for us makes sense from a business expansion perspective,” said Han. “It allows us to more easily get into a new country or market without having to do all the hard work of collecting new road data.”\nWith earnings coming up on March 23, investors could expect to see a Genesis-powered boost to the company’s financial health, he said. “I think we will have very good numbers.”\n",

            "description": "WeRide, one of China’s big three robotaxi companies, has cut research and development (R&amp;D) costs by “millions” of US dollars by using artificial intelligence to train its fleet in virtual worlds, its CEO said.\nWhile rivals had also developed AI models simulating the physical world, WeRide’s efforts stood out as it was using its world model Genesis to support its global expansion strategy, said Tony Han.\n“It’s the first real marriage between physical AI and generative AI,” Han told the South China Morning Post.\nA major challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry has been the high costs associated with developing self-driving algorithms that can generalise across different markets and terrains.\nIn particular, the low tolerance for accidents has meant algorithms must be trained on many low-probability “edge cases” that occur in the real world, as shown by a recent incident in the US where a Waymo robotaxi drove passengers into a police stand-off.\n\nThis has pushed many of the industry’s leading players, including Waymo and Tesla, to turn to AI world models as they seek to reduce unit costs to drive fleet expansion.\nIn China, Guangzhou-based WeRide and crosstown rival Pony.ai have both emphasised their world model efforts in recent months, as they look to keep up with Baidu’s Apollo Go, the domestic leader by fleet size.\nHan said Genesis had allowed WeRide to test new self-driving algorithms in a matter of days in a virtual world, where previously the same tests would have required hundreds of cars operating in the real world for months.\nCrucially, Genesis enables WeRide engineers to simulate rare edge cases that are key to ensuring self-driving safety yet difficult to capture in the real world.\nThis had resulted in a reduction of at least 75 per cent in WeRide’s data labelling and collection costs, Han said, adding that such costs made up a large percentage of the company’s R&amp;D spending – around 316 million yuan (US$46 million) in the third quarter of 2025, or around 73 per cent of total operating expenses.\nHan said Genesis was almost entirely the result of advancements in generative AI technology in recent years. The company’s early experiments with physical world simulations had been rudimentary, with cars and pedestrians represented by Roblox-like blocks, limiting practical usefulness.\nThis changed as generative AI, which uses machine learning to create models of its underlying datasets, made virtual worlds increasingly accurate depictions of the real world.\n\nWeRide trained Genesis using billions of kilometres of real-world driving data collected by the company, including more than eight years of real-world edge cases. Its powerful capabilities mean WeRide could sell the model as a stand-alone product in future – a long-standing “dream” for Han, a former chief scientist of autonomous driving at Baidu.\nHan said limits on access to computational power, more than rising graphics processing unit (GPU) prices, were now the main obstacle to continued improvement, given the clear upside of investment in this area for WeRide’s bottom line.\n“Every dollar we spend improving Genesis leads to 10 times more R&amp;D efficiency, because it’s less spent on road testing and recruiting data labourers,” he said, adding they were now “probably” doubling their GPU stock every quarter. “The constraint is the shortage of memory and availability of certain advanced GPUs.”\nWith the help of AI, WeRide aims to ramp up its global fleet from around 1,000 today to up to 3,000 robotaxis by the end of this year.\nHowever, investors have shown concern for WeRide’s future in a crowded field. Apollo Go and Pony.ai aside, Chinese start-ups such as AutoX and Momenta have also recently expanded pilot programmes, while Volkswagen announced this week its plans to launch its first robotaxi fleet in the US.\nSince its November listing, WeRide’s Hong Kong shares have fallen more than 20 per cent, while its Nasdaq shares have slumped almost 70 per cent in the past year. Analysts have highlighted the company’s continued R&amp;D-driven losses as a point of concern, with profitability not expected until 2030.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Genesis will give WeRide an edge over rivals, with Pony.ai recently touting that its world model PonyWorld generates 10 billion kilometres for testing each week.\nLeading US player Waymo also unveiled its world model earlier this month, built on Google DeepMind’s most powerful world model Genie 3. It said the collaboration with its fellow Alphabet subsidiary gave its model an edge over others in the autonomous vehicle industry, as Genie 3 was trained on a huge number of videos and not just real-world driving data.\nBeyond technical indicators, Han pointed to WeRide’s aggressive global expansion strategy as a differentiator from its competitors, as the strategy could be further enhanced with a powerful world model even if it was not industry-leading.\nWhile WeRide still lags far behind Baidu’s Apollo Go in domestic deployment, the company has already expanded to more than 40 cities across 11 countries and regions, one of the highest in the world, compared with eight for Pony.ai and three for Waymo.\nThe company struck a deal last year with Grab, the largest ride-hailing app in Southeast Asia, and announced a major expansion of its partnership with Uber earlier this month to deploy at least 1,200 robotaxis across the Middle East as soon as 2027.\nMeanwhile, Baidu said on Thursday that Apollo Go had reached 26 cities globally.\n“Genesis for us makes sense from a business expansion perspective,” said Han. “It allows us to more easily get into a new country or market without having to do all the hard work of collecting new road data.”\nWith earnings coming up on March 23, investors could expect to see a Genesis-powered boost to the company’s financial health, he said. “I think we will have very good numbers.”\n",

            "description": "Major Hong Kong developer Sino Land posted a steady net profit for the six months ended December, propped up by early gains from a recovery in the city’s residential property market.\nSino Land reported a net profit of HK$2.22 billion (US$284 million) in the first half of its current financial year – excluding revaluation losses on investment properties – that was slightly down from HK$2.24 billion a year earlier, according to its Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Friday.\nThe company’s revenue rose 34.5 per cent to HK$5.19 billion from HK$3.85 billion a year ago. Revenue from property sales, including sales of associates and joint ventures, jumped 2.8 times to HK$6.91 billion from HK$2.45 billion in the same period in 2024.\nTaking into account a HK$682 million revaluation loss on investment properties, the developer earned HK$1.53 billion in the period, down from HK$1.82 billion a year ago.\n“I am encouraged by the clear improvement in both the economic and operating environment,” chairman Daryl Ng Win Kong said in the filing, citing the interest-rate-cut cycle, Hong Kong’s talent admission scheme and mainland China’s national economic blueprint for bolstering the property sector.\nDelivering his first earnings after taking over the chairman role from his father, Ng highlighted the city’s encouraging property sales performance in the second half of 2025, which delivered proceeds of HK$6.5 billion.\nThe developer’s results come as the city’s housing market showed signs of stabilising. Home prices have climbed 3.7 per cent so far this year, according to the Centaline City Leading Index, after gaining 1.6 per cent in January.\n\nTransaction volumes have also strengthened. Primary home sales surged to a seven-year high in January, reaching about 1,500 units – up 101 per cent year on year – while secondary sales hit an eight-year high at 4,100 units, a 44 per cent increase from a year ago.\nSino Land’s shares edged down 0.1 per cent to HK$12.78 on Friday, but rose 25 per cent this year. Out of the 12 analysts’ recommendations of the stock tracked on Bloomberg, 10 suggested “Buy” and two said “Hold”.\nThe company has two new residential projects in the pipeline: one in Tseung Kwan O and another at Wing Kwong Street in To Kwa Wan that is being co-developed with the Urban Renewal Authority.\nLast month, a joint venture between Sino Land and Great Eagle Holdings won a government residential site tender in Kowloon for HK$1.61 billion, outbidding major Hong Kong developers. It followed another tender win in Tuen Mun for HK$1.09 billion last August.\n“With interest rates on a downward trajectory, we will continue to strategically allocate our cash resources and actively pursue opportunities,” Ng said.\nSino Land declared an interim dividend of HK$0.15 per share to be payable either by cash or shares on April 23.\nProfit at the company’s Sino Hotels unit – owner of City Garden Hotel in Fortress Hill, Conrad Hong Kong in Admiralty and the Royal Pacific Hotel &amp; Towers in Tsim Sha Tsui – increased 19.3 per cent in the six months to December to HK$51.9 million from HK$43.5 million a year earlier, according to a separate disclosure.\nTsim Sha Tsui Properties, another listed company under the Sino Group, recorded a 13 per cent drop in profit to HK$905 million from HK$1.04 billion in the year-earlier period.\n",

            "description": "Nine residential sites will be offered to developers in the coming financial year to provide about 6,650 flats under Hong Kong’s land sale programme, after authorities highlighted the property market had stabilised in the latest budget.\nCombined with other land sources, such as urban redevelopment, private development and projects linked to railway properties, the potential supply of new flats is estimated to reach an eight-year high of about 22,580 in the 2026-27 financial year.\nThe current record was set in 2018-19 when about 25,500 flats were made available.\nSecretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho revealed on Friday that the coming land sale programme would offer nine residential sites, including three that were on the previous list of plots.\n“It is obvious that the market is recovering and transactions have steadily increased,” she said.\nThe nine sites are located in Stanley, Hung Shui Kiu, Ho Man Tin, Sai Kung, Sha Tin and Tung Chung. Each plot is expected to yield between 250 and 1,580 flats.\nThree of the sites are in Hung Shui Kiu, an area of the New Territories that authorities aim to turn into a hub for high-value professional services and logistics as part of the Northern Metropolis megaproject.\n\n\n\n\nThese sites are expected to provide about 3,120 flats, accounting for nearly half of the potential supply from the nine sites.\n“In the future, about half or more of the [city’s overall] supply will come from the Northern Metropolis,” Linn said.\nThe megaproject involves transforming 30,000 hectares (74,130 acres) of land into an economic powerhouse and housing hub.\nThe government also aims to build 308,000 flats across the city over the next 10 years.\nLinn said it was “natural” for more supply to come from the Northern Metropolis, as it was a new development area, whereas the city’s existing urban core was already densely populated.\nShe said the government only planned to put up a site in Tung Chung for sale in the first quarter of 2026-27. The site was part of the previous programme and could provide about 990 flats, she added.\nThe new financial year will be the second consecutive year to exclude commercial sites from the land sale programme.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said on Wednesday that the residential property market had just stabilised but the commercial market remained relatively weak, keeping land premium income at a low level.\nThe administration forecast that the programme would generate HK$18 billion in land premiums in 2026-27, an increase of nearly 3 per cent from the modified estimate for the current financial year.\n",

            "title": "US ruling on Insta360 infringing GoPro patent has no impact on current offerings",
            "description": "A US trade panel investigating a patent dispute between GoPro and Chinese rival Insta360 found a violation involving design applied to outdated cameras of the Chinese firm, effectively allowing it to remain in the US market without any restrictions.\nThe case centred on six patents held by GoPro. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday determined violation of one patent relating to camera design, and issued orders “prohibiting the unlicensed importation by Insta360 of certain cameras and camera systems” that infringe the patent. The order will go into effect after a presidential review.\nThe design is best known for GoPro’s Hero action camera, which has been widely compared with Insta360’s Ace series.\nHowever, the ban “applies only to certain legacy models in Insta360’s Ace series and has no impact on Insta360’s current product offerings in the United States”, said the Shenzhen-based device maker, also known as Arashi Vision, in a statement.\nThe remaining five patents, relating to utility features such as stabilisation, horizon levelling and distortion correction, do not constitute infringement, according to the ruling.\n“As a result of the commission’s ruling, Insta360 will continue to import and sell its existing product line-up in the United States without restriction,” Insta360 said. It called the result “a complete victory”.\nSan Mateo, California-based GoPro hailed the ITC’s decision on design infringement, which it said “reinforces the integrity of GoPro’s visual identity in the marketplace”.\nIn 2024, GoPro filed a complaint against Insta360, alleging a violation of Section 337 of the US Tariff Act of 1930, a law that targets imports that violate intellectual property rights or other fair competition practices.\nLast year, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a similar ruling, finding a violation of the design patent but none related to the five utility patents.\nThe ITC’s decision on Thursday upheld the ALJ’s decision on the design patent, but reversed some details regarding two other patents.\nThe dispute comes as the two camera makers are locked in fiercer competition. GoPro, which has long dominated the action-camera segment, has seen a growing challenge from Insta360, best known for panoramic cameras, and DJI, the Chinese drone giant.\nGoPro’s global market share of action cameras dropped to 18 per cent as of September 2025, compared with 84 per cent in 2022, according to Beijing-based consultancy Meritco Services. At the same time, DJI’s share rose to 66 per cent and Insta360’s to 13 per cent.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong budget 2026-27: minister defends cuts to kindergarten subsidy",
            "description": "Hong Kong authorities have defended a controversial subsidy cut for the kindergarten sector for the coming financial year, saying the low birth rate and resultant shrinking pupil population have prompted a reassessment of education policy priorities.\nSecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin said on Friday that the government would channel more resources towards promoting “high-quality education” and adopt a more targeted approach to helping pupils in need.\nAccording to the 2026-27 budget, which was unveiled on Wednesday, the early childhood sector will receive HK$4.5 billion (US$575 million) from the government, a drop of 6.6 per cent from the current financial year ending on March 31.\nThe government will also scrap two grants that fund kindergarten activities and the hiring of supply teachers. The policies cost authorities HK$15.9 million and HK$24.9 million, respectively, in the last school year.\nIn a media briefing to explain the measures, Choi said: “Hong Kong’s population structure is undergoing changes, with a decline in birth rate and a fall in the school-aged population.”\nThe government has estimated that there will be just 105,800 toddlers enrolled in kindergartens in the next school year, 79,000 of whom will attend subsidised institutions, both of which are record lows.\n“The government’s investment in education has not actually decreased. It is just that resources are now being more flexibly allocated according to the actual situation,” Choi said.\nShe said the cuts had followed a comprehensive review by the Education Bureau.\n“We are of the view that [the cut] will not affect the operation of kindergartens,” the minister said, adding that there were still more than 10 government grants available to kindergartens.\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, government cuts to the primary and secondary education sectors stood at less than 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, spending will increase by 4 per cent for the tertiary and vocational education sectors.\nThe latest budget did not reintroduce a HK$2,500 grant for secondary, primary and kindergarten pupils, despite its scrapping last year under cost-cutting measures prompting a backlash.\nChoi said on Friday that the government planned to use its allocated funds to further promote “high-quality education”.\n“We hope to allocate our resources to help push up education quality,” she said, citing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in curricula and AI training for teachers as examples.\n“This is to be in line with the national development laid down in the 15th five-year plan for 2026–30.”\nAt the same briefing, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun Yuk-han also vowed to continue efforts to attract talent to the city.\n“Although it seems there is not much coverage about it in the budget, Hong Kong attracts talent through its institutional strength, not by increasing expenditure,” he said.\nIn the latest budget, government spending on education is forecast to reach HK$112 billion in 2026-27, accounting for 13.3 per cent of total estimated government expenditure. The figure is 1 per cent higher than the 2025-26 revised estimate.\nOn the social welfare front, expenditure is expected to reach HK$148.1 billion, about 17.6 per cent of total government spending for 2026-27, and 14.4 per cent higher than the 2025-26 revised estimate.\n",
