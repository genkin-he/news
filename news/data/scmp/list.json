            "title": "How Trump’s new White House ballroom echoes the grand monuments of China’s emperors",
            "description": "In October 2025, United States President Donald Trump initiated the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make way for a grand new ballroom, making it the largest alteration to the presidential complex in decades.\\nTrump said the new ballroom, privately funded at an estimated cost of US$250 million, would serve as a venue for “state events worthy of America’s greatness”.\\nThe demolition has provoked fierce controversy.\\nPreservationists, historians and members of Congress condemned the move as an act of vandalism against a national landmark. The National Trust for Historic Preservation warned that the new structure would “overwhelm” the historic core of the White House, while critics accused Trump of bypassing required planning and review procedures.\\nSupporters, however, praised the project as a privately funded modernisation that would leave an enduring architectural legacy.\\nTrump’s architectural adventure fits neatly into a long lineage of rulers bewitched by spectacle. No present-day politician has so instinctively grasped the power of showmanship – the choreographed signing ceremonies, the gilded interiors, the capitalised superlatives.\\nFor Trump, grandeur is not mere ornament but proof of authority, a physical manifestation of success and dominance.\\n\\nHis proposed White House ballroom, like his gold towers and military parades, is the latest expression of his lifelong pursuit of flummery. His aesthetic of excess is designed to dazzle followers and confound critics. In this, he joins the emperors of old, for whom magnificence was inseparable from the performance of power.\\nThey were the showmen of empire: the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty, Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty and the Ming dynasty’s Jiajing Emperor. These were rulers whose craving for grandeur reshaped China’s landscape and imagination.\\nTheir monuments were dazzling in scale yet perilous in consequence, reminders that when public works lose touch with political reality, they risk becoming monuments to folly as much as to glory.\\nThe First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, remains inseparable from monumental ambition. After unifying the warring states in 221BC, he ordered the expansion and joining of separate frontier walls that became the Great Wall, as well as the construction of vast palaces and a tomb complex guarded by the famous terracotta army.\\nThe achievement was staggering. These projects bound the new empire together and laid the foundations for China’s bureaucratic state. Yet they were sustained by forced labour, crushing taxes and pitiless punishments. Within three years of his death, rebellion swept away the Qin, proof that even the most formidable walls and palaces cannot defend a ruler from the resentment of his people.\\nEight centuries later, Emperor Yang repeated the pattern with spectacular ambition. His Grand Canal, linking the fertile Yangtze basin with the north, remains one of the world’s great engineering feats. It revolutionised the transport of grain and troops and stitched north and south together into a single economic system.\\n\\nBut the cost, in blood and silver, was ruinous. Hundreds of thousands were conscripted for the construction of the Grand Canal and other projects. Rebellion followed, and the Sui dynasty collapsed after barely four decades of its founding.\\nThe Jiajing Emperor channelled his vanity into stone rather than canals. Obsessed with Taoism and the afterlife, he ordered the construction of an enormous tomb complex, the “Eternal Mausoleum”, for himself. Officials protested the waste, the treasury emptied and the dynasty’s fiscal strains deepened.\\nThese were just three Chinese emperors with a penchant for building grand monuments. There were many others across the millennia. These rulers left China with architectural marvels, but also political lessons. Great architectural and engineering works can unite nations and inspire generations, yet when conceived in hubris, they drain the state and alienate the governed.\\nWhile Trump’s ballroom is privately funded – thus sparing taxpayers the burdens once imposed by China’s emperors – its legacy will ensure that generations of Americans must live with his vision and aesthetic tastes, grafted onto the symbolic heart of the republic.\\n",

            "title": "The US wants Southeast Asia’s rare earths. Some fear a ‘dig and dump’ redux",
            "description": "Beneath hills draped in ancient rainforests, where rivers sustain millions and biodiversity flourishes, Southeast Asia hides a treasure coveted by global superpowers: rare earth elements.\\nThese minerals – neodymium, dysprosium and yttrium, to name just a few – form the backbone of modern technology, powering everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to MRI scanners and missile guidance systems.\\nAs much as one-fifth of the world’s untapped rare earth deposits are thought to nestle within the region, promising untold billions to whoever can extract and process them for a market hungry for the resources fuelling artificial intelligence, defence manufacturing and the world’s energy transition.\\nChina, long the dominant player in rare earth extraction and processing, has increasingly turned to neighbouring Laos and Myanmar in search of additional deposits. Earlier this year, Beijing sent shock waves through global supply chains by imposing export controls on its own supplies – curbs it recently expanded, before announcing it would suspend some for a year from Friday following talks with the United States and South Korea.\\n\\nNow, Washington is also racing to stake its claim. Donald Trump was all smiles when he arrived at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit last weekend, but behind the scenes the US president wielded the threat of tariffs to pressure export-driven Asean economies into aligning with Washington’s agenda.\\nHe departed with a clutch of trade agreements as well as the optics of a “peace deal” extending a ceasefire along a border that Cambodia and Thailand have bickered over for decades.\\nMore consequentially, he secured two memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Thailand and Malaysia granting US companies preferential access to any newly discovered rare earth deposits, with both nations agreeing to offer American firms the first opportunity to invest, extract or purchase these resources at market rates.\\nWe no longer want to be a country that only digs and ships out cheap raw materials like in the past\\nTengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia’s trade minister\\nIn Malaysia’s case, an additional clause explicitly prohibits export restrictions or quotas, raising eyebrows among environmentalists and trade analysts in a country that only last year imposed a ban on raw rare earth exports to promote domestic refining and value-added industries.\\nBoth agreements include a vague provision to “review and deter certain critical minerals and rare earths asset sales on national security grounds” – with Beijing, Washington’s strategic rival, the presumed target.\\nDenials and unease\\nThe White House says neither agreement is legally binding and may be revoked by mutual consent, but scepticism abounds that Trump’s America would ever willingly relinquish any leverage.\\nAs unease rippled through Thailand and Malaysia over the hastily signed pacts – and the uncertain value of the resources in play – both governments moved to allay fears of a sell-off of strategic national assets.\\n\\n“We no longer want to be a country that only digs and ships out cheap raw materials like in the past,” Malaysian Trade Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told parliament this week, reaffirming the export ban and outlining a policy to attract foreign investment and technology for domestic extraction and processing.\\n“Our policy is not to prevent trade forever,” he said. “Our policy is to prevent the export of cheap unprocessed raw materials so that value is added to Malaysia.”\\nMalaysia is simultaneously negotiating with China on rare earth processing, according to a recent Reuters report, with its sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional said to be in talks with Chinese firms about building a refinery.\\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, under fire for his apparent capitulation to Washington’s demands, insisted there was no provision in the memorandum “that cancels or prohibits” sharing rare earths with other countries.\\n\\nThai officials have also been on the defensive. “This is not a binding treaty,” Thailand’s Industry Minister Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana said on Thursday.\\n“Should any investment take place in Thailand, investors will be required to comply with Thai laws”, he added, citing environmental and public health assessments.\\nThailand’s government has said it sees the US agreement as a long-term opportunity to build expertise in rare earths and expand its presence in the global supply chain, while having little impact on ties with China, its biggest trading partner.\\nStill, fundamental questions remain. Who truly stands to benefit from this new resource rush? How can extraction be managed safely, given the toxic processes involved? And, if necessary, how can Malaysia and Thailand extricate themselves from agreements with the world’s pre-eminent superpower?\\n“These are the nation’s resources, not bargaining chips for hidden political or economic deals,” said Phattarapong Leelaphat, an opposition lawmaker from Chiang Mai, adding that terminating the deal with a country “that holds multiple leverage points over us is no simple matter”.\\n\\nEcological costs\\nChina controls an estimated 60-70 per cent of global rare earth deposits, but Southeast Asia holds up to 20 per cent of known reserves, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\\nMost of these are in Vietnam, with about 3.5 million tonnes, and Myanmar, whose rare earth exports to China were valued at more than US$4.2 billion between 2017 and 2024, according to figures from the US Geological Survey and Washington-based Stimson Centre think tank.\\nEnvironmentalists warn that Myanmar’s experience stands as a cautionary tale. Mining operations, particularly those in Kachin and Shan states, have left deep scars in the landscape, with toxins seeping into soils and rivers across borders. Pollution from 19 militia-controlled sites in Shan state turned the Kok River orange earlier this year, with arsenic levels soaring in the Mekong tributary that flows through northern Thailand.\\nSatellite imagery revealed sprawling “leaching pools” filled with chemicals designed to flush rare earths from rock. Other solvents are used to separate minerals embedded in the same ore, sometimes with devastating ecological consequences.\\n\\nIn Thailand, government surveys indicate rare earth deposits run from Chiang Mai in the north through Mae Hong Son and Kanchanaburi down to Ranong and Surat Thani in the south. Yet even as US miners eye these resources, the pollution in the north of the country has made clear the risks posed by unregulated, or hastily regulated, extraction.\\n“Thailand cannot realistically invest in rare earth mining in the US, because extraction there is far more expensive,” Phattarapong, the opposition MP, said in an open letter earlier this week.\\n“The government must not approve any domestic rare earth mining operations or allow the US to use this MOU to pressure Thailand into opening up its own mines,” he added, urging the government to conduct comprehensive research and establish strong legal frameworks were in place to prevent environmental disaster.\\nWith billions at stake, Southeast Asian governments are racing to tighten oversight of their rare earth sectors. In Indonesia, authorities created a dedicated ministry this year to regulate the industry, after unchecked nickel mining for electric vehicle batteries damaged coral reefs and excluded indigenous communities from the benefits of their land’s resources.\\nMeanwhile in Laos, calls for stricter controls are intensifying after satellite images exposed dozens of illegal rare earth mines, mostly run by Chinese operators, clustered along rivers and tributaries.\\n\\nForests in peril\\nMalaysia, with an estimated 16 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has sought to harness its strategic assets for national gain.\\nSoutheast Asia’s only rare earth processing plant is located in the Malaysian state of Pahang. But the 140-hectare (347-acre) site, operated by Lynas Rare Earths, currently only refines ores mined in Australia.\\nAnwar’s government has vowed not to export raw rare earths, but the language of the US deal has cast doubt on this commitment.\\nConservationists warn that a rare earth rush could further deplete Malaysia’s remaining rainforests, with deposits hidden away beneath the rich ecosystems of Terengganu, Kelantan, Perak, Pahang and Kedah.\\n\\n“Our critical minerals are primarily in high-carbon-stock areas, essentially our forests,” said climate policy analyst Aidil Iman. “This decision will only drive more deforestation.”\\nMining is technically prohibited in so-called Permanent Forest Reserves under Malaysia’s National Forestry Act, but Aidil warned that surging demand might tempt state governments to strip protected lands of that status.\\nMalaysia’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030, designed to propel advanced manufacturing and green industries, envisions the rare earth sector drawing investments of up to 100 billion ringgit (US$24 billion) and creating about 4,000 jobs.\\nAbout 144,000 hectares (356,000 acres) outside forest reserves had been identified for potential mining, acting natural resources minister Johari Abdul Ghani recently told parliament – though he said all projects would require environmental assessments and monitoring by the Forest Research Institute Malaysia.\\n\\nHe added that one pilot site in Gerik, Perak, was already using “in situ leaching technology” from China – a method that uses chemicals to flush rare earths from the soil rather than excavating them.\\nConcerns persist that existing laws are too weak, or too easily flouted, to safeguard against environmental abuse. In Kedah and Perak, illegal rare earth mining in 2022 left behind toxic waste and stripped riverbanks of their biodiversity.\\nThe Environmental Quality Act of 1974 remains Malaysia’s main environmental statute, but critics contend its penalties and enforcement are inadequate to address the scale and complexity of modern rare earth mining.\\nAdam Farhan, co-founder of ecological watchdog RimbaWatch, called the law “outdated and too business-friendly to prevent extractive damage”.\\nIt’s extremely concerning that Malaysia is signing away its sovereign right to regulate minerals\\nAdam Farhan, environmentalist\\n“It’s extremely concerning that Malaysia is signing away its sovereign right to regulate minerals,” he said.\\nRenard Siew, a climate adviser at the Centre for Governance and Political Studies in Kuala Lumpur, said that the memorandum with Washington “shouldn’t be treated as a green light to expand mining unchecked”.\\n“Responsible extraction must include proper environmental and social impact assessments, free and informed community consent, rehabilitation of mined areas and cleaner technologies,” he said.\\nThe government insists that the “dig and dump” era of Malaysia’s extractive industries is long past, but experts warn the country risks too much by courting Trump’s White House.\\n“While Malaysia may be rich in these rare earth resources vital for the global clean energy transition, we should not be pressured by external demands or swayed by short-term economic gains at the cost of environmental damage,” Randolph Jeremiah, vice-president of the Environmental Protection Society Malaysia, told This Week in Asia.\\n“We need to retain full control over these resources, ensuring their exploitation is sustainable and that benefits are equitably secured for the nation in the long term.”\\n",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had renovated the Lincoln Bedroom’s bathroom, putting his latest stamp on the White House after demolishing the East Wing, paving over the Rose Garden and decorating the Oval Office in gold.\\nTrump, who has drawn criticism from preservationists and Democrats for adding a Mar-a-Lago-style sheen to the historic mansion, unveiled the remodelled white-and-black-marbled bathroom via social media.\\n“I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said in his post, which included photos of the bathroom before and after the renovation.\\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” he said. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether the bathroom project had undergone any formal design or approval process.\\n\\nTrump’s abrupt demolition of the East Wing this month to make way for a 8,360-square-metre (90,000-square-foot) ballroom has been criticised for not first going through a proper review.\\nThe White House has said it would submit plans for the ballroom construction for review by the National Capital Planning Commission, which is chaired by Trump’s staff secretary.\\nWhile US presidents over the decades have remodelled rooms in their living space, Trump, a former New York real estate tycoon, has sought to remake the White House with particular gusto.\\nSince taking office in January, Trump has put gold adornments and statuettes in the Oval Office, in a style he prefers. The grass in the Rose Garden was dug up and paved over with white stone.\\nPortraits of Trump have been hung throughout the property, and giant American flags erected on new flagpoles on the north and south lawns.\\nThe green-tiled Lincoln bathroom dated back to a White House renovation conducted by then-President Harry Truman in the 1950s, according to a Washington Post article from 2007.\\nAt the time, then-President George W.

            "description": "Arooj Aftab became the first Pakistani Grammy winner when she took home the global music performance award for her song “Mohabbat” in 2022.\\nA year later, actor and singer Diljit Dosanjh stepped onto the smoke-filled stage of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Southern California, becoming the festival’s first artist from the Indian state of Punjab.\\nIn August, the first-generation Indian-American artist Avara sat in a bed of rose petals at a concert hall in Brooklyn, New York, for the opening performance of her first tour. Fans crowded around the stage for a glimpse of the artist, who has gained over 250,000 new monthly Spotify listeners since November 2024 – a more than 250 per cent increase.\\n“I started getting a bunch of her TikToks,” said audience member Alex Kim, a 22-year-old music assistant. “Everyone has a short attention span these days, but I was like, ‘Wait a minute, I actually really like this.’”\\nFollowing Afrobeat, K-pop and Latin music, songs with South Asian influences are the latest global trend around the world. In April, Warner Music Group launched 5 Junction Records, a label dedicated to selling South Asian-influenced artists to North American listeners.\\n“It’s something that’s been forming slowly,” Billboard CEO Mike Van said about the overseas surge of South Asian-influenced artists. “We started to see these growth spurts over the last couple of years because of all the technology, evolving tastes and activation of these diaspora audiences.”\\n\\nJuergen Grebner, the general manager of 5 Junction Records, said that his label looks for artists with strong fan bases in their home countries. A No 1 song in India “automatically will chart in the Top 20 on Spotify’s global charts”, he said.\\nBorn to Moroccan parents in Toronto, Canada, actress-turned-singer Nora Fatehi performed at the Fifa World Cup 2022, and billions worldwide watched the closing ceremony in Qatar. A Toronto talent agency had encouraged her to explore opportunities in India, and she moved there 11 years ago, learned Hindi and began auditioning for every modelling and acting role she could find, determined to make a name for herself.\\n“The Indian audience is the reason why I am what I am today. So while I’m making myself into a global artist, I’m bringing them with me,” Fatehi said.\\nIn the multibillion-dollar global music business, musicians often need to team up with local artists or brands to expand beyond their popularity at home, Grebner said.\\n“The only way really to win in those markets is to collaborate,” he said.\\nThe international girl group Katseye features members of Indian, Japanese and Filipino descent who starred in a recent Gap advertisement.\\nFatehi’s single “Snake”, featuring US pop and R&amp;B singer Jason Derulo, reached the top 20 on Spotify charts in both the UK and Canada.\\n\\n\\nSome music from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives evolved as a way to teach Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and other spiritual teachings thousands of years ago, said Professor Francesca Cassio, chair of the music department at Hofstra University in New York. One North Indian classical genre, khyal, gained popularity in the West during the 1960s as sitar great Ravi Shankar influenced musicians, including the Beatles and John Coltrane.\\nAs the US becomes increasingly diverse, it has been encouraging to see younger audiences showing an “overall acceptance of global sounds”, Van said.\\nVan pointed out that Gen Z and Gen Alpha are leading the charge in embracing music that crosses cultural lines.\\n“Artists have a direct connection now to their fans,” said Van. “You’ve got clips now, literally edited down to 10 seconds or less, that are capturing people’s attention that can go viral. And so it’s a new way of not only promotion, but also again, consumption and discovery.”\\n\\nAvara gained a social media following by posting videos that blend her meditative R&amp;B and soul music with elements of her years of Indian classical and Western vocal training.\\nIn Marietta, in the US state of Georgia, she grew up feeling “never a part of the brown community but never completely a part of the American community”, she said.\\n“I was around a lot of white people and people that didn’t look like me, and I rejected a lot of parts of myself,” she said.\\nHer debut album, a softer place to land, honoured the artistic community that shaped her over the past two years. Her next project, Mara, is about reclaiming her identity as a “young brown girl” through the lens of a “third-culture kid” – someone who grows up balancing their parents’ heritage with the cultures they are raised in, she said.\\nShe described her next album as a mixture of every culture that has influenced her over the past 25 years, blending Indian vocal riffs with Spanish guitar, reggae and other styles.\\n“I’m trying to create something completely different,” she said. “I’m trying to create a new genre with this stuff that comes from those influences of what I learned as a kid.”\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong civil servants should do their civic duty and vote in Legco election",
            "description": "Halfway into the two-week nomination period for the Legislative Council elections, the Hong Kong government is doing its best to get out the vote. This includes staging an extensive publicity campaign and making an appeal to civil servants to support the ballot next month. In a letter to the 171,000-strong civil service on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu strongly urged all civil servants to cast their votes on December 7.\\nCiting the Civil Service Code, which requires government employees to support the local administration’s governance, he said voting was a “manifestation of civil servants upholding” the Basic Law and their allegiance to the city as pledged in their oaths. “As the backbone of the government, civil servants should set an example and cast votes in elections to fulfil their civic responsibility,” Lee said in the letter.\\nThis is not the first time civil servants have been reminded to vote as part of their duty to support the administration. Lee stopped short of saying whether those who did not vote would be punished. When asked if the government was hoping the turnout rate in the geographical polls would surpass the 30.2 per cent in 2021 – the lowest since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule – Lee stressed there was “no hard target”.\\nThe appeal must not be seen as civil servants being pressured to vote. There is also no question of their political neutrality being compromised, as they were not asked to vote for a particular party or candidate. As stipulated in the Civil Service Code, government employees have a duty to support the chief executive’s policies and his governance. They should also lead by example and demonstrate to the public that voting is a civic duty.\\nSpeaking last week at the launch of the election process, Lee also called on the private sector to encourage their employees to vote. “I strongly urge all sectors of society, including various institutions, businesses, organisations and groups, to fulfil their social responsibility by encouraging employees to vote on polling day, and offering them support where feasible,” he said.\\nAs reported by the Post, some businesses and public bodies are heeding his call. For instance, Sino Group will grant its staff members half a day’s leave to encourage them to vote. Hopefully, more companies and institutions will do their part to facilitate the vote.\\nThe government should work harder to promote the election among different sectors, and encourage voters to make use of their ballots to bring better governance and a better future for Hong Kong and the country. Candidates should also do their part in appealing to voters by coming up with solid policy initiatives.\\n",

            "title": "On Taiwan, the ‘one-China principle’ is the bottom line",
            "description": "The Communist Party’s fourth plenum communique reaffirmed the promotion of peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait and advancement of the cause of national reunification. Within a day, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee designated October 25 as the annual day of commemoration of Taiwan’s return to Chinese sovereignty – 80 years after the surrender of Japanese forces in Taiwan to the then ruling Kuomintang.\\nThis sends a telling message. The Beijing leadership sees the return of Taiwan to China after 50 years of Japanese occupation as part of the process of reunification. The commemoration is therefore a significant national event. It means that Taiwan has always been part of the Chinese nation. The bottom line is that so long as Taiwan recognises the one-China principle, anything is negotiable.\\nIn contrast to the plenum, the Taiwan issue did not arise in official accounts of Thursday’s summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. That Trump omitted or forgot it should be a timely reminder to pro-independence forces that one China is the reality they have to accept. The decision on the October 25 commemoration dovetailed with the party’s call to “advance the great cause of national reunification” as part of the 15th five-year plan. The plenum communique urged the party to “work for long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau, promote peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait and advance the cause of national reunification”. That resonates with an official commentary since published by state news agency Xinhua, that after peaceful reunification, Taiwan’s current social system and way of life would be fully respected, with “patriots governing Taiwan”.\\nThe one-China principle remains the bottom line. No one wants to see forced reunification but Beijing cannot rule it out so as to deter any independence attempt. Taiwan should accept that reunification will happen sooner or later. Dialogue with Beijing can foster mutual trust and consensus. Under new chairwoman Cheng Li-wun, the current opposition party KMT should play a more proactive role in promoting cross-strait relations. Meanwhile, the return of Taiwan to China 80 years ago should be commemorated by all Chinese people.\\n",

It’s going to be long lasting,” Trump said, crediting his personal rapport with Xi for the success. “I got along with President Xi very well … The meeting with China was incredible.”\\nDespite Trump’s chest-thumping, analysts said there are serious questions about the agreement that leave ample room for misunderstanding, misinterpretation and a slide into another downward spiral and do not address some of the most significant irritants in the US-China relationship.\\n“The rivalry’s structural fault lines remain intact,” said Han Lin, Shanghai-based China managing director with the Asia Group. “Unsurprisingly, both leaders are playing to their bases, not building lasting peace.”\\n\\n\\nThursday’s pact, building on a framework announced earlier in the week, averts a threatened escalation in the trade war and secures a pledge by China to buy at least 25 million tons (25.4 million metric tonnes) of US soybeans annually for the next three years, along with sorghum and other farm products.\\nTrump has boasted that the deals made in Asia are bringing in “over US$3 trillion really, in profit”, telling farmers to “go out and buy larger tractors and more land” in anticipation of the windfall.\\nAfter reaching a 15-month high on trade-deal optimism a day earlier, soybean futures slipped Wednesday as US farmers took profits from the previous session’s rally.\\nThe agreement also tackles Beijing’s rare earth export curbs, crucial for US tech and defence. China has agreed to pause these restrictions for a year, with Trump hinting on Thursday that the truce could be “very routinely extended”.\\nIn return, the US cut fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese imports from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, framing it as an incentive for Beijing to curb illicit opioid production.\\n“I’ve given China great incentives to hold down the fentanyl, get rid of it,” Trump said on Friday, noting its medical uses while blasting its illicit trade.\\n“I really believe that they have an incentive,” he added. “I’d love to get rid of the extra 10 per cent.”\\nThe president’s apparent willingness to make more concessions, at least for now, marks a pivot from his tariff-heavy strategy.\\nTrump insisted the deal’s strength lies in the personal rapport between top leaders – and his own intelligence.\\n\\n“I think for a long period of time, we have a smart president. We have a great relationship. If we don’t have a smart president – which is also a very strong possibility – then we won’t have a great relationship,” he said.\\nBut analysts outlined several areas of potential concern about the US-China deal, including the lack of any detailed written account of its terms.\\nWhile China has pledged to “work very hard” at stemming the flow of fentanyl ingredients, in Trump’s words, no specifics have been disclosed involving what China might do beyond what it has already.\\nThis is hugely consequential given that Beijing’s evident pledge on fentanyl is the basis for a 10 percentage point reduction in overall US tariffs on Chinese goods – to 47 per cent from 57 per cent.\\nThe deal also suspended US tariffs on Chinese imports set to hit November 1 for rare earth minerals and November 10 for “reciprocal” tariffs. Unclear, however, is how long the pause will last, whether it extends for 90 days as Trump has done repeatedly in the past, or has a longer tenure.\\nThe two sides also appeared to have a different take on what was agreed to regarding China’s rare earth export restrictions, essential for US hi-tech manufacturing of everything from food processors to military jets.\\n“Both sides are seeking to reduce their dependence on the other, and extend the other party’s dependence,” said Michael Hirson, practice head at 22V Research and a former financial attaché with the US embassy in Beijing. “This tussle is particularly intense in rare earths and semiconductors.”\\nWhile Trump said the “rare earth issue has been settled”, Beijing has focused on the pause’s one-year time frame, highlighting the continued leverage it holds over the US.\\n“It’s welcome news that Beijing agreed to hold off implementing its recently announced sweeping rare earth export restrictions, but we should expect Beijing to use this threat as a hammer over the US’ head,” said Wendy Cutler, senior vice-president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\\n“Trump has met his match with China, which has shown that two can play at this game,” added the former deputy US trade negotiator.\\nIndeed, both sides have kept their trade ammunition handy, underscoring the lack of trust and the highly delicate nature of the truce.\\nTrump could quickly raise tariffs again if he believes China is not complying with the terms of Thursday’s deal. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said hours after the agreement was announced that a Section 301 investigation into China’s compliance – with provisions for additional tariffs – remains in place.\\n\\nSomewhat surprising, some analysts said, was the lack of a deal in South Korea on an “ownership transfer” of the short video platform TikTok, which had been teed up as a likely deliverable, indicating there may be more problems hammering out terms than suggested.\\nElsewhere, Trump wrote on social media that China committed to buying energy products. Yet this was not mentioned in the Chinese readouts.\\nAlso unclear was whether Trump promised Beijing it would ease export restrictions on high-end US semiconductors, a move that many in US national security circles believe would cede a key US technological advantage to America’s primary rival.\\n“His potential willingness to allow Nvidia to sell the B30A – a chip designed for China’s market and substantially more advanced than the H20 chip that Beijing has disdained – aroused a sharp reaction … in US policy circles, especially among China hawks,” Hirson said.\\n",

            "title": "Cuts to US ‘fentanyl tariffs’ help Chinese exporters close the gap on competition",
            "description": "With the US cutting its tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 per cent – halving a duty initially imposed by Washington over allegations of complicity in the fentanyl trade – analysts said the reduction may further strengthen the competitiveness of Chinese exporters, particularly in mass-produced goods.\\nFollowing a meeting on Thursday between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in South Korea, the world’s two largest economies reached a consensus on the issue, with the US agreeing to remove half of its 20 per cent in fentanyl-related tariffs on China, effective immediately.\\nThe 90-day pause on tariff increases the two sides agreed to during trade talks in May, extended by another 90 days in August, was also lengthened after this week’s meeting, this time for one year.\\nThat brings overall US tariffs on Chinese goods to 47 per cent, down from the previous 57 per cent, Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the summit. Those figures include duties imposed before Trump’s second term.\\n“The 10 per cent tariff cut on top of generally higher tariffs on the rest of the world should help improve exporters’ competitiveness to varying extents moving forward,” said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist with Dutch financial services firm ING.\\n“Generally, China has the world’s most complete manufacturing infrastructure and benefits from economies of scale, allowing it to outcompete many other nations.”\\nDexter Roberts, a US-based senior fellow at the Global China Hub under the Atlantic Council think tank, said that Chinese exporters are already “hyper-competitive” compared with their Asian counterparts, due to the intensity of the domestic market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, with the US tariff cut, that advantage will become more evident, particularly for lower-margin products, Roberts said.\\n“Doing this on razor-thin margins is something often other countries find it hard to compete on,” he said.\\n“If they’re selling at a 10 per cent cost advantage, as soon as the fee is taken away, suddenly China becomes competitive again. For the traditional lower-value goods, the margins were extremely low,” Roberts said. “If you’re selling shoes or toys, 10 per cent is huge.”\\nThe additional duties the US imposed on China this year have been reduced to 20 per cent following the cut, narrowing or eliminating the tariff gap between China and other manufacturing hubs in Asia, including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan.\\nVietnam is currently subject to US tariffs of 20 per cent – which could be raised by an additional 40 per cent if it is found to be facilitating transshipments from China – while South Korea and Japan are each subject to 15 per cent import duties.\\nRenewed trade tensions between the US and China this year have prompted discussions among manufacturers about relocating parts of their production to Southeast Asia to mitigate the impact of trade barriers.\\nBut as the tariff landscape has changed, analysts said investors may reconsider their manufacturing arrangements, which could in turn bolster China’s exports.\\n“The commitment to postpone the pending reciprocal tariffs by one year should help improve market sentiment thanks to reduced near-term uncertainties, allowing corporates to recalibrate investment decisions and supply chain adjustments,” said Zhang Ning, senior China economist at UBS, in a research note on Friday.\\nZhang added that the tariff cut is “modestly positive for China’s export growth and global supply chain”.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, HSBC said in a Thursday research note that, if US tariffs are kept at current levels, this could help restore business confidence and investment.\\nThe bank estimated that China’s gross domestic product growth could be boosted by as much as 0.3 percentage points from the US tariff cut.\\nAs the world’s largest economy, the US remains China’s top single-country export destination, with an outbound shipment value of US$524.7 billion in 2024 according to Chinese customs data. This is more than three times the figure for Vietnam, the second-highest ranked country by export value.\\nHowever, Chinese exporters have been reducing their reliance on the US this year. In the first nine months of 2025, China’s exports to the US declined by 16.9 per cent year on year.\\n“The 10-percentage-point reduction is expected to have a significant positive impact on Chinese exporters and play an important role in stabilising exports to the US,” said Cui Fan, a professor of international trade at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics, in an article posted to social media on Thursday.\\nIn his piece, Cui argued cumulative US tariffs on China now stand at around 41 per cent, rather than the 47 per cent cited by the Trump administration.\\nHe based this rate on a broad average that includes the tariffs invoked under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, as well as sector-specific tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\\n",

            "title": "Bella Heathcote’s journey from Neighbours to Tulsa King – and why she collects skulls",
            "description": "The latest addition to the cast of Paramount+ hit show Tulsa King, Bella Heathcote may be a familiar face to horror fans. The Australian actress, who plays Cleo Montague in the crime drama, made her big-screen debut in the 2008 horror film Acolytes and was in Tim Burton’s 2012 horror-comedy Dark Shadows and Netflix’s 2022 horror miniseries Pieces of Her alongside Toni Collette.\\n\\nThe mob drama – created by Taylor Sheridan, whose impressive résumé includes Yellowstone and Landman – follows Sylvester Stallone as Dwight “The General” Manfredi as he sets up his own empire in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after being exiled there by his mafia boss.\\nSince Cleo entered the scene, fans have seen a new side of her old flame, Manfredi’s trusted lieutenant Mitch Keller (Garrett Hedlund).\\n\\nHere’s everything you need to know about Bella Heathcote.\\nShe began acting after her mother died\\n\\nBorn in May 1987 in Melbourne, Isabella Heathcote started taking performance classes when she was 12 at her school, Korowa Anglican Girls’ School. Her mother had died and her father, a lawyer, thought they would keep her distracted.\\nHeathcote fell in love with singing, dancing and drama, but she hesitated at first at the idea of pursuing acting as a career. It was a nudge from her father that convinced her to study drama at university.\\n“By the time I got through my first year, I realised I could only pursue acting because everything else just made me miserable,” the actress told the Herald Sun in a 2016 interview.\\nShe has a varied résumé\\n\\nFollowing her film debut in Acolytes, Heathcote starred in the long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours. She played a Berlin-born filmmaker – even leveraging her schoolgirl German and working with a dialect coach – in the Amazon Prime Video dystopian alternate-history TV series The Man in the High Castle, based on the 1962 novel by Philip K. Dick. In 2017 she portrayed Christian Grey’s mentally ill and potentially dangerous ex-girlfriend Leila in Fifty Shades Darker, the second film in the Fifty Shades franchise starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.\\nShe collects skulls\\n\\nDuring a 2012 interview with Vogue Australia, when asked about boyfriend-worthy gift recommendations, the 38-year-old revealed that she collects skulls, adding, “I think that a beautiful skull is a really good gift for a guy”.\\nIs Bella Heathcote single?\\n\\nBad news for those crushing on the actress: Heathcote is married to architect Richard Stampton. The pair wed in 2019, according to her IMDB profile. Before Stampton, Heathcote was engaged to filmmaker Andrew Dominik, 20 years her senior. The two dated for seven years before the internet spotted Heathcote on Instagram, wearing a diamond on her ring finger to Lily Collins’ birthday party. The couple split up soon after.\\n",
