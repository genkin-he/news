            "description": "The arrival of United States President Donald Trump in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, may appear to be a routine diplomatic gesture, but it carries far greater symbolic weight. His visit marks a turning point in Washington’s struggle to remain relevant in a world where its power no longer defines the terms of engagement.\\nFor decades, Asia listened when America spoke. Today, it still listens, but it no longer obeys.\\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) was born in an era when the Global South sought autonomy from the rival blocs of the Cold War. Trump’s presence at Asean underscores how dramatically global and regional dynamics have shifted. The US, once the centre of gravity, now orbits around new constellations of power.\\nWhile the US has engaged with Asean for decades, former US president Joe Biden was notably absent from major summits after his second year in office, only attending one in-person summit after Covid-19. Trump himself lost interest in the bloc during his first term, skipping all major meetings after 2017.\\nWashington’s willingness to re-engage Asean, on the bloc’s own terms, is not a gesture of generosity, but an act of necessity, perhaps evidenced by the signing of rare earths deals with Malaysia and Thailand.\\nThe US can no longer afford to ignore a grouping that represents one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, one increasingly setting its own agenda on trade, technology and security. For Southeast Asia, Trump’s visit is less about nostalgia for American leadership and more about a pragmatic opportunity to balance between global superpowers without taking sides.\\n\\nAfter years of frustration in the Middle East, Washington is quietly conceding that its grand projects there have failed to deliver. The withdrawal from Afghanistan and an effective stalemate in Iraq have exposed the limits of American reach. Even the 12-day war launched by Israel against Iran with American backing and participation failed to meet its objectives: it did not eliminate Iran’s nuclear capabilities nor triggered regime change.\\nIn this vacuum, the emerging partnership among Iran, China and Russia has altered the balance of global power. It is no longer possible for Washington to dictate outcomes in the region or completely isolate Tehran through sanctions or coercion. What was once called “containment” now looks more like self-containment, a narrowing of American influence amid expanding Eurasian alliances.\\nMeanwhile, China’s Belt and Road Initiative continues to knit together a new economic geography from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean. Russia’s energy corridors and Iran’s growing connectivity to South and East Asia have created an infrastructure of interdependence that even sanctions can’t fully disrupt. Against this backdrop, Asean’s quiet rise looks less like an exception and more like a frontier of this multipolar momentum.\\nTrump’s visit to Malaysia, a symbolic bid to restore US leverage, reveals the changing reality of American power in Asia but also exposes the limits of American ambitions.\\n\\nThe US can no longer dictate the rules of the regional game; it must play by them. Even close partners like Singapore and Indonesia are hedging against American unpredictability, deepening their economic and security ties with China while continuing cooperation with the West.\\nIn trade, the US is no longer the dominant actor. Its withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership left a vacuum quickly filled by frameworks like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which even includes US allies. Washington’s absence in rule-setting processes has forced it into a reactive posture. Trump’s trip isn’t about shaping Asia’s future. It’s about catching up to it.\\nThis is where Trump’s transactional style might find its true test. His approach of “deals, not doctrines” resonates with leaders who view politics through the lens of negotiation rather than ideology. However, deal-making requires credibility, something Washington lacks after years of policy reversals.\\nFor much of the post-war era, US diplomacy was about defining rules, institutions and legitimacy. Now, Washington is learning to operate within a system it no longer fully controls. The symbolism of showing up for the first time in years is twofold: it signals Washington’s desire to remain relevant while also acknowledging that relevance must be earned, not assumed.\\n\\nAsia, meanwhile, has grown comfortable with complexity. Countries once anxious about choosing between Beijing and Washington pursue what scholars call “multi-alignment”, engaging all sides while committing to none. It’s a quiet revolution in regional strategy that marks the end of unilateralism. Power today flows through networks, not hierarchies.\\nFor Asean, this evolving power balance has a practical meaning: agency. The bloc’s members have learned to use their collective weight to mediate rather than submit and invite rather than align. The real story of Trump’s Malaysia visit is not a return of US leadership, but the normalisation of Asian autonomy.\\nTrump’s visit is not a comeback; it’s a confession that the age of commanding the world from a position of unchallenged authority is over. The future of global politics from Tehran to Kuala Lumpur to Caracas will be negotiated, not imposed.\\nThe US can lead, but leadership today demands humility just as much as ambition. In the halls of Asean, where postcolonial nations built a platform for mutual respect and restraint, Trump’s presence is a reminder that the balance of power has shifted, not towards chaos, but towards pluralism.\\nThe world no longer revolves around Washington. Yet if the US can learn to participate rather than dominate, it may discover that influence in the 21st century comes not from commanding others but from understanding them.\\n",

            "description": "Police in Shenzhen, the technology hub in southern China’s Guangdong province, have smashed a syndicate selling counterfeit imported chips to mainland manufacturers, according to local media, exposing an underground market for high-end semiconductors amid US export controls.\\nThe syndicate’s modus operandi was to collect discarded chips, which were laser-polished and relabelled, and sold as imported products from Infineon Technologies, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices, according to a report last week by domestic online media Rule-of-law China.\\nShenzhen police on Thursday confirmed the report, but declined to provide further details.\\nMembers of the group posed as European agents who targeted local manufacturers of car electronics and industrial control systems, according to the report, which also indicated that the fake chips were prone to malfunctions and could pose safety risks.\\nThe syndicate established multiple shell companies that churned out and sold the fake chips in a purported “made-to-order” production model, and had conducted the scam multiple times, the report said.\\nPublic security authorities in Shenzhen’s Nanshan district, which covers the southwest area of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, had worked with local market regulators for four months since June before they were able to bust the counterfeit ring and arrest one member, according to the report.\\nThis marked China’s first major criminal case against fake imported chips, the report said. Shenzhen authorities have also established a traceability mechanism with international chipmakers, it added.\\n\\nLocal demand for bogus chip imports reflects the tight domestic supply of foreign-made semiconductors amid US tech export restrictions, which has also resulted in a thriving black market for the illicit procurement of high-end integrated circuits.\\nChina’s massive demand for advanced semiconductors to power artificial intelligence development projects has created a fast-growing market for smuggled graphics processing units (GPUs), such as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips.\\nAt least US$1 billion worth of Nvidia’s GPUs were shipped to China in the three months after US President Donald Trump tightened chip export controls, as the Blackwell architecture-based B200 emerged as the most sought-after imported AI chip in the domestic black market, according to a July report by The Financial Times.\\nAlthough German chipmaker Infineon, along with US firms Texas Instruments and Analog Devices, mostly focused on supplying mature-node chips used in the automotive and lower-end industrial manufacturing sectors, some of their products have remained subject to US export controls.\\nThe Shenzhen syndicate bust comes a month after Beijing tightened its scrutiny against the US legacy chip suppliers.\\nIn September, China’s Ministry of Commerce launched an anti-dumping investigation into imported American analogue chips. It said these US chip suppliers had “lowered and suppressed the sales prices of domestic products” over the past few years.\\nUS authorities, meanwhile, had secretly put location-tracking devices in shipments of advanced chips they suspected of being at high risk of illegal diversion to China, according to a Reuters report in August, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.\\nIn the same month, US authorities arrested two Chinese nationals on charges that they sent tens of millions of dollars&apos; worth of Nvidia-designed AI chips to China. They were charged with violating the Export Control Reform Act and could face 20 years in prison, according to the US Justice Department.\\n",

            "title": "Asian Tour: McKibbin leads low-scoring charge with record round at Link Hong Kong Open",
            "description": "Tom McKibbin set the Link Hong Kong Open alight on Thursday, firing a course record 10-under-par 60 on a day of low scores in Fanling.\\nThe Northern Irishman’s eight birdies and one eagle left him a shot short of the magical 59 that Patrick Reed produced on his way to winning last year on the Hong Kong Golf Club’s composite course.\\nJazz Janewattananond carded a 61 to sit alone in second, with Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Louis Oosthuizen and Thomas Pieters tied for third at eight under.\\nJust three shots separated the top 10, with Hong Kong amateur Jeffrey Shen Wang-ngai producing a stunning seven-under 63 to sit alongside the likes of International Series Rankings leader Scott Vincent and LIV Golf’s Matt Jones.\\n“It was obviously a very, very good round,” McKibbin said. “I didn’t really miss too many shots, holed a few nice putts and took advantage of the two par-fives that there are out there. And yes, 60 shots later, I’m sitting here.”\\n\\nAs well as a course record, it was a personal one too, with McKibbin never having gone lower than 62 before Thursday. Matching Reed was never really on the cards either, despite the 22-year-old, who started his day on the 11th hole, being six under by the time he got to the 18th tee.\\n“I looked at the scorecard after 17 holes and saw it was a par 70, so I knew I had to eagle the last [par-four 10th], so maybe that helped,” McKibbin said. “But yes, 60 is the lowest round that I have ever shot – 62 has been my best before. So it was nice to break that, fantastic.”\\nReed’s historic effort came with preferred lies in place, meaning it was not officially recognised as the lowest round ever produced over the 18 holes, which comprises parts of the club’s New and Eden courses.\\nThat honour had remained with Aaron Rai, who shot a 61 in the second round on the way to winning in 2018.\\nShen, meanwhile, was back in the clubhouse in an early tie for second before most players had even got to the course.\\n\\n“Everything is going well, and I built my confidence in the practice round because I didn’t play well last week,” Shen said. “My dad caddied for me, so we did a pretty good job. He just wanted me to keep it simple.\\n“I mean, I like this feeling, with my family and my friends here to support me, and because this is my home course, every time I feel really good here. At Hong Kong Golf Club, it is all about the putting. So you need to plan for it, because the pin position is changed every day.”\\nShen’s performance also erased the disappointment he endured last week at the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Dubai.\\nA 20ft putt for birdie on the 18th – one of nine he managed in the first round – helped Shen forget the woes of a week in the Middle East when he ended up in hospital twice with heatstroke.\\n“I had a couple of big tournaments coming up, so I tried so hard the last two months,” he said. “I just needed rest. So I just slept a lot and now this. It’s amazing.”\\nShen had a day he will never forget, and so did fellow Hongkonger Taichi Kho, but not for the right reasons. Kho produced the worst round of the day, a seven-over 77 that left him rooted to the bottom of the leaderboard.\\nBetween the two National Games teammates, their compatriots enjoyed varying degrees of success. Jason Hak Shun-yat was the next best at four under, with Isaac Lam two shots further back and Matthew Cheung at one over. Closer to Kho than Shen were Leon D’Souza and Michael Wong on three over, with Terrence Ng at five over.\\n",

            "title": "Trump hails ‘great success’ after talks with Xi raise hopes of easing US-China tensions",
            "description": "China and the United States have reached a truce on thorny issues ranging from soybeans and rare earths to fentanyl, following Thursday’s meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in South Korea.\\nTrump hailed the talks at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan as a “great success” and said he had agreed to visit China in April. He added that Xi would visit the US “some time after that”.\\nThe summit may help the two countries’ relationship enter a “more constructive phase” following a series of clashes over trade, according to observers, but they warned that a series of deep-rooted problems within the relationship could still derail any progress.\\nThe 100-minute meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since Trump returned to the White House in January.\\n“Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,” Xi told the US leader, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.\\nHe added he was willing to continue working with Trump to “build a solid foundation for China-US relations and create a sound atmosphere for the development of both countries”.\\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One shortly after he left South Korea, Trump said the two leaders had “agreed to almost everything” and described the summit as “amazing” and a “good meeting for two very large, powerful countries”.\\nAsked when a deal would be ready, he replied: “I think pretty soon. We have not too many major stumbling blocks.”\\nHe had previously threatened additional tariffs over China’s expanded curbs on rare earths, but after the meeting he said: “We have a deal … We’ll negotiate at the end of the year but all of the rare earth [issue] has been settled.\\n“There’s no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while.”\\nFollowing the summit, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the country’s latest curbs on rare earth exports – announced earlier this month – would be paused for a year.\\nTrump added that fentanyl – another long-standing source of tension – was a complex issue, but the two leaders “agreed that [China] was going to work very hard” on it and take some “real action”.\\nWashington, he continued, had agreed to halve its fentanyl-related tariffs on China from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The move also reduces the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.\\nDuring his first term, Trump placed sanctions on China, which he accused of failing to stop the export of the chemicals used to make the synthetic opioids that have been blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US.\\nTrump said Beijing had also agreed to buy “tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products” immediately.\\nAccording to American agricultural lobby groups, China had already made its first soybean purchases from this autumn’s US crop ahead of the meeting.\\nThe US leader added that other topics discussed included chips and ways of working together to end the Ukraine war, but he said Taiwan – one of the most sensitive topics in their relationship – “never came up”. There was no reference to the issue in statements from the Chinese side.\\nBefore the meeting, there had been speculation that Trump would shift Washington’s long-standing position on Taiwan to reach a deal with Beijing.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China and has never ruled out the use of force to reunify it with the mainland.\\nThe US, in common with most countries, does not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons to defend itself.\\n“Overall, I guess on the scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12 … The whole relationship is very, very important,” Trump said.\\n\\n\\nXi told Trump: “China-US economic and trade relations have experienced ups and downs recently, and this has also given the two sides some insights.\\n“The business relationship should continue to serve as the anchor and driving force for China-US relations, not a stumbling block or a point of friction.”\\nHe added: “The two sides should think big and recognise the long-term benefit of cooperation, and must not fall into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.”\\nThe Chinese leader also stressed that dialogue was better than confrontation, adding that communication between the two countries should be maintained “through various channels and at various levels to enhance mutual understanding”.\\nThe report said the two sides had also agreed to cooperate on trade, energy and other areas as well as promote people-to-people exchanges.\\nBeijing also said the two leaders had agreed to maintain regular exchanges but was more vague about the possibility of each visiting the other country.\\nThe foreign ministry’s statement said only that Trump “looked forward to visiting China early next year” and that he had invited Xi to America.\\nDylan Loh, an associate professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said the Xi-Trump meeting was consequential because it addressed a number of “irritants” both old and new in US-China relations.\\n“The agreements reached on rare earths, soybeans, fentanyl and the possibility of loosening chips restrictions would create conditions to inject stability into the relationship,” he said.\\nHe also said the “positive comments and conciliatory tone” from both leaders were significant because they signalled to both government officials and their respective publics “that there is scope to bring the relationship back to a more normal track”.\\nLoh added that “US-China competition is not going to stop” because of the summit or Trump’s possible visit to China.\\n“What the meetings do, however, is to help reduce instability and volatility,” he said.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, the summit generated positive momentum for future relations and effectively prevented a further escalation of tensions.\\nHe said the two leaders had provided “clear, top-level direction” for the two countries’ trade relations and he expected a “relatively stable frequency of talks” between high-level officials as the two sides focused on implementing the agreements they had reached.\\n“Based on the consensus reached and Trump’s planned visit to China, US-China relations are expected to enter a more constructive phase in the short term,” he said.\\nBut Sun warned that even if the meeting had helped to reopen communications channels between the two sides, deep-seated structural issues – ranging from technology controls to industrial policies and market access – remained unresolved, which meant that a more comprehensive deal would be more difficult to achieve.\\nHe also warned that there were differing voices on China within the Trump administration, and that those who had been calling for a tougher approach towards Beijing could still disrupt the relationship between the two countries.\\nHan Shen Lin, the China managing director for The Asia Group, said sustained de-escalation in the near term was possible, but relations were “fragile” and depended on factors such as China’s fentanyl crackdown or US tariff relief.\\n“Domestic politics could also derail progress if either side seems weak. Notwithstanding the occasional flare-ups, the truce should hold enough for future Trump-Xi talks to continue, which is better than an unchecked trade war,” he said.\\nThe meeting took place in South Korea ahead of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in Gyeongju.\\nTrump arrived in the country on Wednesday, when he met President Lee Jae-myung, but will not stay for the Apec summit and left soon after his talks with Xi finished.\\nXi, who arrived in Busan the following day, is expected to stay in the country for three days. The trip is likely to include a meeting with Lee as well as the Apec event.\\nAdditional reporting by Kandy Wong\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "description": "Global gold demand hit a record high in the third quarter of 2025, the World Gold Council said in a new report, adding that it remained upbeat about the outlook for the precious metal.\\nThe findings came amid a recent pullback in gold prices after a months-long rally that had sent it to record highs.\\nGold demand reached 1,313 tonnes – or about US$146 billion in value terms – between July and September, the highest quarterly total on record, according to the report released by the trade association on Thursday.\\nThe report attributed the rise primarily to surging investment demand driven by “a powerful combination of an uncertain and volatile geopolitical environment, US dollar weakness and investor FOMO [fear of missing out] as the price climbed higher”.\\nThat led total gold demand to soar 44 per cent in value terms from the same period last year in the third quarter, while demand rose by a modest 3 per cent year on year in volume terms, the report said.\\n“With the record high level of gold demand and prices in the third quarter of 2025, we expect gold demand to remain strong,” said Fan Shaokai, head of Asia-Pacific (ex-China) and global head of central banks at the World Gold Council, in a press release issued on Thursday.\\nFan added that the association expected central banks to “continue their buying streak” and that the metal would retain “its lustre as a resilient option for a growing pool of investors looking to diversify”.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the report, investment demand grew by 47 per cent year on year in the third quarter, reaching 537 tonnes and accounting for 55 per cent of overall net gold demand.\\nNet purchases by central banks in the third quarter reached 220 tonnes – up 28 per cent from the previous quarter and 10 per cent year on year – despite record-high prices, the report noted.\\nGold prices underwent a decisive pullback last week after the spot price peaked at more than US$4,380 per ounce – a gain of over 60 per cent since the end of last year. The spot price was up 1.9 per cent for the day at just under US$4,004 as of Thursday afternoon, according to financial data provider Wind.\\nThe World Gold Council stressed that the environment remained favourable for gold to continue attracting buyers.\\n“Continued US dollar weakness, lower interest rate expectations and the threat of stagflation could further propel investment demand,” said Louise Street, a senior markets analyst at the association.\\n“Our research indicates the market is not yet saturated and the strategic case to hold gold remains firmly in place.”\\n",

On the Chinese side was Foreign Minister Wang Yi, his deputy Ma Zhaoxu, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, Vice-Premier He Lifeng, Xi’s chief of staff Cai Qi, and National Development and Reform Commission chairman Zheng Shanjie.\\nOn the American side was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, chief of staff Susie Wiles, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and David Perdue, the US ambassador to China.\\nXi arrived in Busan on Thursday morning for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit to be held in Gyeongju. Trump skipped the gathering after attending some events with business leaders on Wednesday.\\nThe meeting venue – a grey building with a light blue rooftop near Gimhae International Airport – is heavily secured. Barbed wire fences make the site inaccessible to the public and most media, with heightened security serving as the only visible sign of the leaders’ presence.\\nSeoul struck a balance for the reception ceremony for the two leaders in Busan, with both arrivals treated as a state visit. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun greeted them separately at the airport.\\nA red carpet was rolled out for Xi’s arrival, with honour guards lining up and a 21-gun salute. Xi arrived at the summit venue in a Chinese-made Hongqi vehicle.\\nTrump had arrived in South Korea a day earlier. He also received a 21-gun salute, while a South Korean military band performed “Y.M.C.A.”, a 1970s hit song that became a staple at Trump’s campaign rallies.\\n",

            "title": "German scents exhibition combines 1,000 years of fragrances with art and history",
            "description": "Ever wondered what war smells like? Or pondered the odour of love, the stench of medieval Paris, or the fragrance of religion?\\nA new exhibition in Germany allows visitors to discover unknown smells by sniffing their way through 81 different fragrances across 37 different galleries.\\nThe show “The Secret Power of Scents”, which opened to the public on Wednesday at the Kunstpalast museum in the city of Duesseldorf, combines fragrances with art, taking visitors on a journey of more than 1,000 years of cultural history.\\n“This exhibition is an experiment – and an invitation for our audience to discover the history of scents with their noses,” says Felix Kraemer, the museum’s director general.\\nThe exhibition follows a chronological order, from religious artefacts of the Middle Ages through to contemporary art of the 21st century. The galleries are equipped with atomisers and diffusers to create a connection between the art and the smell of a specific time period or cultural context.\\nThe scent of myrrh wafts through a darkened gallery of Christian wood carvings depicting various scenes from the Bible. Christianity, Judaism and Islam all used myrrh as a symbol for prayer and purification, the show explains.\\n\\nSmell evokes stronger emotional reactions than any other sense. It comes as no surprise that visitors almost retreat in fear when they press a button in a gallery depicting war from World War I. The scent was created by mixing the pungent smell of gunpowder with the metallic odour of blood and sulphur.\\n“Anyone who has ever experienced war, conventional war, will hate it, because you can actually smell the brutality of war here,” says Robert Mueller-Gruenow, the show’s curator and a leading expert in the field of scent and scent technology.\\n“It’s the first exhibition worldwide to bring scents into a museum in this form, format and scale,” he says.\\nOn the other side of the fragrance spectrum, there is the Venus and Adonis painting from 1610 by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, showing two lovers.\\n“This room is all about passion and emotions,” Mueller-Gruenow says, adding that the smells diffused here are dominated by roses and the scent of the civet – a cat whose scent was considered erotic in the 17th century, but makes today’s visitors turn up their noses in disgust.\\nCertain smells also connect to different eras of history; pressing the button to release the stench of medieval Paris makes some visitors choke when they inhale a mix of sewage, mould and unwashed bodies.\\n\\nOn the other hand, in a gallery dedicated to the Roaring Twenties, there is an oil painting by Gert Heinrich Wollheim from 1924, which celebrates the liberation of women, who at the time began wearing bold lipstick, bobbed their hair and smoked cigarettes in public. The room is filled with the uplifting scent of tobacco, vanilla and leather – a mixture that is a nod to famous early fragrances such as the historic Tabac Blond, which was launched by the fragrance house Caron in 1919.\\nMoving on to modern art, the museum presents more contemporary smells between works of Andy Warhol, Yves Klein or Guenther Uecker, that remind visitors of world-famous brands such as Coca-Cola or German airline Eurowings, which diffuses a pleasant and relaxing scent on the plane when passengers board.\\nIn addition to the application of scents in marketing, the museum also shows the role of very modern scents such as the fragrance molecule “Iso E Super”, a dazzling scent that supposedly makes its wearers more attractive.\\n“It’s a fragrance that smells like cedarwood, but it also has something very velvety and skin-like about it,” says the curator. “It smells very human, warm and flatteringly approachable.”\\nFor visitors strolling and sniffing their way through the show, which runs until March 8 next year, the 81 different scents opened up a whole new world, visitor Kirsten Gnoth says.\\n“I’ve been to the collection here before, but now it’s completely new with scents that match the pictures and eras,” she says. “It’s exciting to combine art with scents.”\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong pioneers world-first clinical trial for breast cancer procedure",
            "description": "The University of Hong Kong has pioneered a first-of-its-kind clinical trial that integrates lipofilling surgical practices with breast conservation, providing a new solution for cancer patients that promises to improve their well-being post-operation.\\nThe preliminary findings released on Thursday by the university’s Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine also showed that breast cancer patients who underwent the procedure showed no signs of immediate surgical complications or recurrence of the disease.\\n“One of the biggest fears for many women diagnosed with breast cancer is the possibility of losing their breasts,” said Ava Kwong Hoi-wai, a clinical professor and breast cancer researcher who led the university’s study.\\n“Our goal is to expand the treatment options for patients suitable for breast-conserving surgery to improve post-operative breast symmetry and natural appearance – ultimately improving patients’ confidence and quality of life,” she said.\\nBreast cancer was the most common form of cancer among women in Hong Kong in 2022, according to the Centre for Health Protection. It was also the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in 2023.\\nWhile a mastectomy, or breast removal surgery, has traditionally been the most common form of treatment for breast cancer, women are increasingly receiving a type of conserving surgery where parts of the surrounding tissue are used to reshape the breast after the tumour has been removed.\\nBut Kwong said such treatments could still result in large scars or a smaller post-operation breast shape, depending on the size of the tumour and the amount of surrounding tissue, which was particularly a problem among Asian patients.\\nLooking for a solution, Kwong’s team launched clinical trials in 2024 for a relatively newer treatment for breast cancer patients that integrates lipofilling techniques into breast-conserving surgery.\\nLipofilling is a form of surgery similar to liposuction, whereby fat is removed from one part of the body and injected into another part to add volume or restore its shape.\\n\\nKwong said that while lipofilling breast reconstruction was already available at some private medical institutions in Hong Kong, most procedures were for women who had already undergone a mastectomy or another form of breast reconstruction surgery.\\nInstead, the clinical trial allowed for patients to undergo both the tumour removal and breast reconstruction in one surgery, rather than spreading the procedures over two or three operations.\\nThe study also marked the first randomised control trial for the procedure in the world, and also the first using Asian patients, Kwong said.\\nPrevious studies into the feasibility of the procedure had been localised to Western countries, she said.\\nFifteen women have already undergone the procedure as part of the trial, with none having experienced cancer recurrence.\\nWomen who underwent the lipofilling procedure showed an average 10 per cent increase in breast volume compared with the 12 per cent reduction observed in the control group.\\nTo measure patients’ overall health and well-being, the team used Breast-Q, a widely used patient-reported measure for breast cancer outcomes.\\nThe team found that women who received the lipofilling procedure gave higher median scores in terms of psychological well-being, sexual well-being and satisfaction with their breasts compared with the conventional group.\\nKwong said the team ultimately hoped to perform their procedure on 48 breast cancer patients, and encouraged patients to sign up.\\n",
