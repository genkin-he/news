            "title": "In Trump’s rare earths rant, US soldiers find a weary world policeman",
            "description": "“Hydraulic or magnets?” US President Donald Trump asked some baffled American troops stationed in Japan during his visit this week, and demanded to know which was better.\\nThat was during a speech aboard the USS George Washington, before hundreds of American servicemen and women who appeared to have no idea what their commander-in-chief was talking about.\\n“You know, the new thing is magnets. So instead of using hydraulic that you can be hit by lightning and it’s fine, you take a little glass of water and you drop it on magnets, I don’t know what’s gonna happen.”\\nThen he got to his point. “Which is better,” he asked. “Hydraulic …”\\nThat evoked cheers from some in his audience.\\n“ … or magnets?” The crowd went silent.\\n“What the hell is wrong with these people?” an exasperated Trump complained.\\nYou can hardly blame them. It seems Trump wasn’t talking about ordinary magnets, but rare earth magnets. But he failed to clarify and had everyone scratching their heads.\\n“I’m gonna sign an executive order. When we build aircraft carriers, it’s steam for the catapults and it’s hydraulic for the elevators,” he said in a stream of consciousness.\\n\\nBehind the comic moment was some very serious business. The Trump administration desperately needs to reach deals to ease the pressure of China’s announced export controls over rare earths such as neodymium and samarium. Neodymium and samarium-cobalt magnets produce much stronger and more durable magnetic fields than other types of magnets, and that is what makes them valuable. Both have extensive and essential military applications.\\nIn their first meeting in six years this week, President Xi Jinping promised to lower some rare earth controls while Trump would halve select tariffs to 10 per cent.\\nI doubt going back to steam or hydraulics is the answer for the US.\\nNeodymium magnets are used in electric motors and actuators, which convert signals from sensors into mechanical actions in military aircraft, drones, battleships and ground offensive vehicles and electronic gear used by soldiers in combat.\\nSamarium-cobalt magnets can maintain functions at extremely high temperatures, making them ideal for use in jet engines and deep-sea vehicles, in guidance systems for missiles and smart bombs, in satellite and radar systems, stealth aircraft and battleships.\\n\\n\\nLockheed Martin’s F-35, billed by the US as the world’s most advanced fighter jet, substantially relies on such advanced magnets. However, the aircraft is so expensive and high-maintenance that many US allies are having second thoughts about buying them, potentially preferring less advanced but more robust warplanes.\\nIn his speech, Trump made it sound like he was talking about the kind of magnets children play with; he might as well be. Many in his military audience probably knew far more about those advanced military-grade magnets than their president, if only they knew what he was referring to.\\nTrump’s reference to building aircraft carriers may be less straightforward. It’s hard to know what was on his mind. But some educated guesses are possible. After Japan, Trump went to South Korea.\\nTo counter China’s dominance in shipbuilding, the Trump administration has been pressuring South Korea to invest in such capacities in the United States – “Make American shipbuilding great again” (Masga) – in strong-armed tactics similar to what he has been using on Taiwan to produce more of its advanced semiconductors in the US.\\n\\n\\nThe US currently only accounts for 0.04 per cent of global shipbuilding output, compared with 28 per cent of South Korea, which in turn is just slightly more than half of China’s. Shipyards in the US have been hampered by outdated facilities and a lack of skilled workers, both of which South Korea is expected to supply. Shipbuilders Hanwha Ocean, Samsung and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries have all been drafted into the Masga programme with investments worth around US$150 billion.\\nMeanwhile, the US Navy has warned that current submarine and aircraft carrier production is insufficient, resulting in the US fleet being overstretched and facing deployment gaps. That was probably what Trump was thinking about when he referred to building aircraft carriers while aboard the USS George Washington.\\nWhy the US needs to patrol the world and threaten other nations is a good question. When Washington talks about military insufficiency, it really means the capacity to strike anywhere in the world, rather than protecting the homeland, which it is more than capable of.\\nThe residents of US allies like South Korea have baulked at Trump’s demands. Of course, China isn’t playing ball.\\nThey were probably on the US president’s mind when he asked about “magnets or hydraulic”.\\n",

            "description": "Chinese police are working with UK law enforcement authorities to track down fugitives and illicit funds involved in a massive cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering case, but experts see little likelihood for victims to recoup their losses.\\nAccording to a statement, police in the northern city of Tianjin were “doing everything possible” to help more than 128,000 Chinese investors recoup funds caught in a web of fraudulent wealth schemes perpetrated between 2014 and 2017 by a syndicate, which converted cash into bitcoins and property to hide the scam’s proceeds.\\nBusinesswoman Qian Zhimin, alias Zhang Yadi, in September pleaded guilty at London’s Southwark Crown Court, following what is believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world, now worth more than US$6.7 billion.\\nQian, 47, had converted the scammed funds into bitcoin and entered the UK, where she attempted to further launder funds. As part of their investigation, British police in 2018 seized digital wallets holding more than 61,000 bitcoins.\\nA government task force in Tianjin on Thursday called for victims to submit and confirm their information on an online platform, and urged them to wait patiently for the return of funds.\\n\\nThe case underscored the “grave importance of international law enforcement and judicial cooperation in combating transnational crimes in the digital era, especially in light of the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies”, said Andrew Fei, partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\\nVictims of Qian’s scam, however, are expected to face great difficulty in recovering their losses, according to Liu Zhengyao, a lawyer at Zhiheng Law Firm in Shanghai.\\nUK authorities would first need to determine whether all the seized digital assets were bought with funds from Chinese investors, Liu said.\\nThe substantial rise in bitcoin prices also raised questions about how to handle the increased value, he added. Bitcoin traded below US$10,000 in 2018. As of Friday, the world’s largest crypto token costs nearly US$110,000.\\nVictim compensation in the Qian case would also require diplomatic efforts, which further complicates the process, according to Liu.\\nThe British government proposed the establishment of a compensation scheme for the Chinese victims, while it also sought to keep most of the seized bitcoins, according to reports by The Financial Times earlier this month.\\nThe use of cryptocurrency remained common among criminals, despite the growing mainstream traction of the digital asset industry.\\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice seized 127,271 bitcoins from Chen Zhi, chairman of Prince Holding Group, who was accused of running a massive “pig butchering” operation in forced-labour scam compounds across Cambodia.\\n",

            "description": "A glass lift being built into one of Bali’s most photographed cliffs has triggered outrage from locals and travellers after viral photos showed construction piercing through the island’s iconic Kelingking Beach – a site often nicknamed the “T-Rex” or “dinosaur” cliff for its striking shape.\\nThe 182-metre-high lift and adjoining 64-metre bridge are being built by Chinese developer China Kaishi Group to replace the steep and often treacherous hike down to the beach on Nusa Penida, a small island off Bali’s southeast coast. The project is valued at more than 10 million yuan (US$1.4 million).\\nBut when images of the lift shaft cutting through the iconic ridge began circulating online this week, many Indonesians were quick to denounce the project as a violation of the island’s natural beauty.\\nCaptioning a before and after photo of the cliff, social media user pendakilawas wrote: “Honestly, it looks so ugly, it reminds me of a foreigner who said he went to Bali or Indonesia’s natural attractions not to enjoy 5-star hotels or any luxurious facilities, but to purely enjoy the beauty of nature.”\\n\\nJujur Jadi jeleek banget, jadi teringat ada bule yang bilang dia ke bali atau wisata alam Indonesia bukan untuk menikmati hotel bintang 5 atau fasilitas mewah apapun itu, tapi menikmati murni keindahan alam\\nKelingking Beach, Nusa Penida, Bali pic.twitter.com/jclM7WSCw6\\n— pendakilawas (@pendakilawas) October 27, 2025\\n\\n“It’s a shame that the beautiful view of Kelingking Beach has been destroyed by the lift project,” local resident Made Sediana told the Bali Sun newspaper. “Tourists come to Nusa Penida to enjoy the beautiful panorama, not the lifts.”\\nHe questioned the need for easier beach access at all, noting that Kelingking is a no-swim zone where accidents are common. Safety concerns were renewed after an October 15 drowning involving a French tourist who entered the water despite warnings from lifeguards.\\n“Many tourists experience accidents because they go down,” Sediana said. “If it were easier for guests to go down, it would be dangerous too. The coastline is narrow there, and big waves come suddenly. The best way to enjoy Kelingking Beach’s beauty is from above.”\\nApart from the environmental impact, many also expressed concern about the project’s permits and licences.\\nIn response, Bali Governor I Wayan Koster confirmed on Thursday that he would be looking deeper into the licensing and permits situation to see if there are any violations, The Bali Sun reported. “If violations are serious, it’s closed.”\\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Tourism has likewise sought to calm public anger, saying it has been supervising the project in coordination with local authorities since the planning stage in 2023.\\n“The Ministry of Tourism also encourages the lift developers to apply green construction standards during the construction process, and in the future, to utilise technology that uses renewable energy sources to minimise the impact of global warming,” Hariyanto, the ministry’s deputy for destination development and infrastructure, said as quoted by Tempo magazine.\\nHe added that the lift could become a new attraction to boost visitor numbers and the average length of stay on Nusa Penida.\\nThus far, construction had not affected the number of visits to Nusa Penida, he said, citing data from the Klungkung Regency Tourism Office that showed a significant increase in the number of tourists visiting the area – from 714,335 in 2023 to 1,108,791 in 2024.\\n\\n“Looking ahead, tourist visits are expected to remain high, even as the construction of the lift continues. This optimism is supported by Nusa Penida’s global achievements as the best beach in the world, as recognised by Tripadvisor in 2024 and Trip Best 2025 Global Water Fun Attraction by Trip.com,” he said.\\n“In addition, with a daily average of around 3,000 to 6,000 tourist visits, the Klungkung Regency government is optimistic that the target of 1.5 million tourist visits can be achieved by 2025.”\\nOverdevelopment has become a major issue in Bali, especially after flash floods in September caused the Indonesian government to declare a state of emergency on the island.\\nMore than 4.6 million foreigners visited Bali from January to August this year, according to Agence France-Presse, outnumbering the island’s 4.4 million residents.\\nThe infrastructure catering to them has prompted “land conversion, chaotic urban management and lax enforcement of spatial planning laws”, Made Krisna Dinata, executive director of non-governmental organisation Walhi Bali, told the news agency.\\nIn the wake of the floods, Governor Koster moved to curb runaway construction by banning the conversion of agricultural land into commercial developments such as villas, restaurants and hotels, The Jakarta Post reported.\\n",

            "description": "The UN human rights chief said on Friday that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organisation.\\nRavina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Turk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\\nShe said Turk believed “air strikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.\\nShamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counterterrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\\nIntentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life”, she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”\\nThe strikes took place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.\\n",

            "title": "Beyond a trade deal: are more Xi-Trump summits the pathway to a new era of stability?",
            "description": "The world’s two largest powers signalled at least 14 months of likely stability in US-China relations following a pivotal summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump – and hinted they would meet “regularly”, setting the stage for more encounters next year.\\nWith a trade deal expected to be signed as soon as next week, Beijing and Washington reached a truce on thorny issues ranging from soybeans and rare earths to fentanyl during talks that highlighted the personal connection between the two leaders and struck a conciliatory tone for long-term ties.\\nMinutes after the high-stakes meeting in South Korea, Trump told reporters on Thursday that both sides had agreed that he would visit China in April and that Xi was also expected to visit Palm Beach or Washington “some time after that”.\\nBeijing’s official release later confirmed that Trump looked forward to visiting China “early next year” and that Xi had been invited to visit the US.\\n\\n\\n“The two presidents agreed to maintain interactions on a regular basis,” said the Chinese statement issued by the state news agency Xinhua.\\nAccording to the statement, Trump said that since China would host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ gathering in 2026 and the US will host the Group of 20 summit later next year, Washington expected both “to be successful”.\\nThe two annual events would provide opportunities for the two heads of state to engage in person again, though attendance has yet to be confirmed.\\n“Both sides agreed to support each other in striving for positive outcomes at both summits,” said a commentary published on Friday by the official People’s Daily in China.\\nThe article – written under the byline Zhong Sheng, a pseudonym meaning “Voice of the Centre” – claimed that the Xi-Trump meeting was widely viewed as sending a “positive” signal to the world, “injecting new momentum into the stable development of China-US relations”.\\n“Positive interactions between the two countries on regional and world platforms are key to addressing the ever-emerging global challenges,” the article added, echoing Xi’s message to Trump during their conversation.\\n\\nSpecific dates for the 2026 Apec summit have not been announced, but recent meetings have taken place in October or November, suggesting the possibility that the conference could serve as a platform for Trump to visit China again after April.\\nTrump, however, skipped this year’s Apec leaders’ gathering in Gyeongju, South Korea, in a move reflecting his long-standing disdain for multilateral forums.\\nStill, the America first president announced in September his plan to host the G20 leaders’ summit – reportedly scheduled for December 2026 – at his Doral golf club near Miami, after missing this year’s event in South Africa.\\nIt remained to be seen whether next year’s summit would coincide with a reciprocal visit by Xi to the other side of the Pacific Ocean or provide an opportunity for the Chinese leader to make multiple US trips next year.\\n“I think the Chinese realised that with President Trump in office, it is an opportunity to reset the relationship in terms of mutual respect,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told FOX Business on Thursday in an interview after the bilateral summit.\\nThe two presidents were able to focus more on “bigger picture ideas” during their discussions, including what the remainder of Trump’s term would look like, Bessent added.\\nThe “next 14 months” could be consumed with preparations for Trump’s visit to China and Xi’s potential US trip for the G20 summit, according to Melanie Hart, senior director of the Washington-based Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\\n“China’s biggest concern with Trump is his unpredictability, and they are using an extraordinary line-up of pre-scheduled 2026 meetings to box him in and force a degree of, if not quite predictability, at least plannability in US-China relations,” Hart said in a note on Thursday.\\n“Trump’s planned visit to Beijing gives China the opportunity to script the next interaction and to press for a new wave of US concessions over the coming months to lay groundwork for a ‘good’ meeting,” she added.\\nStill, that could herald a more frequent pattern of face-to-face engagement between Chinese and US leaders compared with Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.\\nPartly disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the balloon incident, the former president never visited China during his four-year term, meeting Xi only three times: in Indonesia in 2022, the United States in 2023 and Peru in 2024.\\nDa Wei, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, said that the Xi-Trump summit marked “a narrow but important opportunity” for the two countries to enter “a new phase” of bilateral relations.\\n“The conditions are ripe for an inflection point in US-Chinese relations that could set a path towards a more stable and effective relationship,” he wrote in an article published in Foreign Affairs on Thursday.\\nIn a relationship characterised by “level-headed stability”, China and the US should regulate the intensity of the competition and establish clearer lines to demarcate where their economies and societies should interact and where they should be independent”, Da said.\\n“The two countries also need to recalibrate their geopolitical relations in the Indo-Pacific,” he added, calling on Washington and Beijing to de-escalate tensions around Taiwan.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\n",

            "title": "For this Chinese whisky distillery, making a tipple with a local accent is about ‘balance’",
            "description": "To most people, “terroir” means the natural environment in which wines and whiskies are produced, and which gives them their unique characteristics.\\nTo Beijing-born whisky distiller Yang Tao, it can also mean the human spirit. He showcases this in The Chuan, “China’s first prestige malt whisky”, launched in mainland China in December 2023 and in Hong Kong in August 2025.\\nThe Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery sits at the base of Mount Emei, one of Buddhism’s four sacred mountains of China, in Sichuan province, two hours from Chengdu.\\nThe distillery, which is mainland China’s first prestige whisky maker, was launched by Pernod Ricard. Yang previously worked for the international spirits giant in Scotland before helping build the Chinese distillery.\\n\\n“We want to respect the tradition of whisky, but new elements are bound to emerge as whisky-making migrates to new environments,” Yang tells the Post.\\n“For example, whiskey made in the United States has a more wild, untethered and stimulating quality; Scotch whisky is clearer and more elegant, like a gentleman; Japanese whisky is soft and gentle, like sashimi.”\\nAs for The Chuan, Yang thinks it should possess a mild and moderate temperament, in line with the Taoist emphasis on harmony.\\nYang, who has worked in the spirits industry since 2006, says that China’s natural resources are the foundation of the distillery. From the water flowing down Mount Emei to the Danling oak – from the protected Changbai Mountains in northeastern China – used to make the barrels, they all help shape the whisky.\\nMany Chinese liquor producers have distilleries in Sichuan province or neighbouring Yunnan province, and Yang says this is because of the region’s terroir.\\n“Firstly, we are upstream of the Yellow River, which means the water is of higher quality. Secondly, it’s not windy here and the weather is relatively mild. Lastly, the humidity and light drizzle create an optimal environment for mushrooms and microorganisms.”\\nDetails such as these are explained in The Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery Experience Centre, beside the distillery.\\nThe complex, open to the public, was designed with sustainability in mind by Chinese architecture studio Neri &amp; Hu. Contemporary Chinese artist Zhan Wang’s steel sculptures, collectively titled Fractal Structure – Infinite Shan Shui, are thoughtfully installed throughout the site.\\nVisitors can take part in a 90-minute sensory walking tour to learn about The Chuan, from the meaning of its Chinese name – layers and rivers – to details about its logo, Mount Emei’s terroir, and the European and Chinese barley used to make the whisky.\\nThere is also an outdoor salon where visitors can touch the wood used to make the whisky barrels.\\n\\n\\nAs some of the first people to produce whisky in mainland China, Yang and his team found themselves in uncharted territory, which made choosing the right wood for their barrels a challenge.\\nThe team initially wanted to use Chinese oak casks, but many carpenters suggested using easier-to-find French oak.\\nToday, the casks in which The Chuan is matured are made of oak from various places. American bourbon casks imbue the spirit with coconut, vanilla and cream notes, while Spanish sherry casks add notes of toffee, raisin, nut and chocolate.\\nThe team did, however, persist in its pursuit of Chinese oak, jumping through legal hoops to harvest the Danling oak for its barrels.\\n“If we’re only going to use French wood, why don’t we just distil it in Europe?” Yang says. “We believe in making a Chinese whisky unique to China.”\\n\\nThe distillery now uses Danling oak trees that are 80 to 100 years old. They emit an enticing aroma of sandalwood and mandarin peel, contributing to The Chuan’s unmistakable Chinese character.\\n“Ultimately, it’s about a pursuit of beauty that is very Chinese. It’s about the balance in yin and yang and layering different aspects together to create something with smoothness and richness. The West has its philosophies, as do we, in things like our tea and cuisine,” Yang says.\\nThe team behind The Chuan – and many serious Chinese drinkers – poetically translate terroir to “wind and soil”, or fengtu in Mandarin. But fengtu carries a broader meaning beyond nature to encompass human traditions and experiences.\\nAccordingly, it is not just the ingredients, but the culture that surrounds it, that makes The Chuan quintessentially Chinese.\\nThis is reflected at The Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery Experience Centre, where tours begin with a small cup of tea. There is also a whisky tasting bar, a gift and coffee shop, and a restaurant called The Yan.\\n\\n\\nThe Yan was launched in collaboration with Art Yinba, a refined Sichuan restaurant in Chengdu, and takes advantage of the local terroir to create innovative dishes.\\nAt this Post writer’s visit in mid-October, the 14-course menu included a three-part Sichuan-inspired amuse-bouche with seasonal organic vegetables, another three-part appetiser including foie gras marinated in bourbon barrel-aged whisky and topped with caviar and wrapped in rice paper, a Danling oak-smoked pigeon with peppercorn and grilled pigeon innards, and a yak shoulder clod aged in oak-infused oil for 30 days.\\nNo fine-dining experience is complete without drink pairings, all of which were from The Chuan: a pure malt whisky, a Danling single oak whisky and a Pedro Ximénez sherry cask option to conclude the meal.\\nCurrently, only The Chuan’s pure malt whisky is for sale, but Yang says his team has been test-farming a new breed of barley in Sichuan and working towards using its own cultured yeast, which is still in the early development stage.\\n\\n\\nYang quips that he is thankful the distillery has not pressured him too much to make a single malt whisky, but he hopes to present it to the market in a few years.\\n“The goal is not to clash or compete with anything already on the market, but to fill in gaps and supplement what is already there,” he says. “I think it’s important to have diversity, and The Chuan is about sharing whisky culture here and promoting China pride to the world.”\\n",

            "title": "Like ‘Singapore’s Orchard Road?’ Malaysia’s plan for Bukit Bintang upgrade draws fire",
            "description": "A government plan to spend nearly US$1 million on decorative lights and other cosmetic upgrades in Kuala Lumpur’s famed Bukit Bintang district has drawn fierce backlash, with residents questioning the priorities of city planners as floods and ageing infrastructure continue to plague the Malaysian capital.\\nThe Housing and Local Government Ministry on Wednesday unveiled the “I Lite U” initiative – a 4 million ringgit (US$950,000) project to illuminate Bukit Bintang and spruce up its streets ahead of the Visit Malaysia Year 2026 tourism campaign.\\nMinister Nga Kor Ming said the goal was to make the entertainment district “no less than Ginza street in Tokyo or Orchard Road in Singapore”, with a parade “as good as Disneyland’s” planned for the official launch on January 3.\\nBut the plan was met with quick disapproval on Malaysia’s raucous social media, with dozens of comments reminding the minister of the constant fear of flash floods and deadly falling trees caused by increasingly unpredictable storms.\\n“So busy focusing on fun only. Fix the flooding first,” read a comment by one Iskandar Arshadi to a social media post on Nga’s announcement.\\n\\nOfficials, however, argue that a refreshed Bukit Bintang would help Kuala Lumpur remain competitive with other Asian shopping corridors, draw higher‑spending tourists and support businesses in the surrounding area, especially ahead of the country’s show‑piece tourism year.\\nNga said the lighting, cleaning and traffic measures were being coordinated with Kuala Lumpur City Hall and waste‑management agencies to keep the area clean and vibrant.\\nThe ministry has also linked the project to a wider push to create more nighttime attractions in the capital on the argument that tourists stay longer and spend more when there is a safe, well‑lit evening precinct.\\nYet for many Kuala Lumpur residents, the idea of evening strolls and late-night festivals rings hollow when basic infrastructure remains so vulnerable to extreme weather. Nearly a dozen roads were cut off by flash floods during evening peak-hour traffic in April, as rivers and storm water drainage systems around the city failed to contain the surge in rainfall during a storm.\\nAn estimated 1.5 million cars travel in and out of Kuala Lumpur daily and as many as 6 million cars are packed into the city on any given day, according to government data.\\nLast week, a man was killed and a woman injured in two separate incidents as a raging storm caused trees to fall on their cars while they were driving.\\nIt was the latest fatality caused by ageing trees in Kuala Lumpur. Last year, one person died and another was injured when a tree fell on 17 vehicles in the city centre.\\n\\nMalaysians have also slammed the government for its fixation on trying to rebrand Bukit Bintang into a copy of popular destinations in other countries, arguing that the district already has a “vibe” of its own.\\n“Tourists don’t fly to Kuala Lumpur to see another Orchard Road, they come for the KL vibe, the multilingual crowd, the contrast between old shophouses and new towers,” read a comment by one Zachary Chia. “Authenticity sells better than imitation.”\\nOthers suggested the government focus on increasing representation of the country’s diverse ethnic groups and cultures in Bukit Bintang instead of letting it become overrun by Arab shawarma restaurants and Chinese pulled noodle joints.\\n“No need to copy. Turn Bukit Bintang into the face of Malaysia,” said one Sazali Abu Bakar.\\nThe government has set aside a total budget of 700 million ringgit to promote Visit Malaysia Year 2026. It hopes to pull in 47 million foreign visitors and about 330 billion ringgit (US$78.2 billion) in tourism revenue next year.\\nMalaysia ranked as Southeast Asia’s top tourism destination so far this year, pulling in 28.2 million visitors over the first eight months of 2025, according to government data. It was a 14.5 per cent surge from a year earlier, driven by relaxed visa requirements for visitors from China and India.\\nIt outstripped the performance of regional rival Thailand, which saw its total visitor count fall 7 per cent to 21.8 million over the same period as Chinese nationals avoided the kingdom over fears that they could be targeted by crime syndicates.\\n",

            "title": "Link Hong Kong Open: Wu Ashun stays in hunt – and owes it all to local philanthropist",
            "description": "Before the age of 16, Wu Ashun had not picked up a golf club, let alone swung one in an attempt to hit a ball.\\nYet 24 years later he is playing in this week’s Link Hong Kong Open with multiple wins under his belt and a career that raised the bar for players in China.\\nAnd it might never have happened if not for a Hong Kong-based philanthropist called Wang Jiashui, or “Mommy”, as the 40-year-old refers to her.\\n“It 100 per cent definitely changed my life – oh man, I was lucky, I was very lucky,” Wu said.\\nWu was playing basketball at school in his hometown of Zhangzhou, in Fujian, when golf coach Jason Song Mingfeng arrived in 2001 looking to recruit players for a new academy.\\n\\nOf the 200-plus pupils who tried out and underwent “a lot of testing, like power testing, flexible testing or patience testing”, only 12 or 13 made the cut, Wu among them.\\nIt was then that Wu found out that everything was free. Food, coaching, education, all were supported by Wang – support that has continued throughout his career.\\nWu’s golfing education began in earnest, even if the surroundings were somewhat rustic. A patch of grass by the school was turned into a green, a rough patch of ground became a driving range, and the days were long.\\n“When I picked up the club, I couldn’t play,” Wu said. “I went to play a shot and the ball would still be there [on the ground]. We trained pretty hard. Running in the morning, waking up at 4.30am or 5am. It was pretty early.\\n“After breakfast, we would go to school to study. Then we would have golf lessons: how to grip the club, how to stand. Then at night we would learn the rules, and learn golf English, like what was a green, what was a birdie.”\\nWhen they had developed their skills to a certain level, the group would sling their clubs on their backs and walk some distance “to the real drive range”.\\n“We had to walk maybe 10km [6.2 miles] there to practise, [hit] maybe a couple of hundred balls, and walk back to the school, and that was summer time, so it was really hard,” Wu said.\\nIt was worth it. Wu turned professional just six years after first picking up a club, joining the Asian Tour in 2008. He won his first title at the Toshin Golf Tournament in Ryosen four years later, becoming the first Chinese player to win on the Japan Golf Tour.\\nMore history followed in 2015, when his Volvo China Open victory made him the first Chinese player to win a European Tour event on home soil. A decade later, another triumph in Shanghai was his fifth DP World Tour title.\\n“And everything happened from that lady we call Mommy,” Wu said. “She’s a great lady, and every time I come to Hong Kong, I will go to her house to have dinner or something, and she supported me from nothing to go to being a professional.\\n“A lot of people didn’t go professional, but she still supported them … going to college in America, they go to coach, they go to working on the golf course. And she always supports, she doesn’t care if you made it as a professional, so that’s great.”\\nThe pair will have plenty of time to catch up this year. Wu’s four-under-par 66 in Friday’s second round took him to seven under for the tournament, keeping him around for the weekend, although hauling in the leaders might be asking a lot.\\nTom McKibbin backed up his record-setting opening round of 60, with a 65 to reach the halfway stage at 15 under and with a two-shot cushion at the top of the leaderboard.\\nPeter Uihlein, meanwhile, briefly flirted with a magical 59. Having started his day on 11, he was nine under through 16 holes before disaster struck on the par-four ninth. A triple bogey ended that bid, and he finished with a 63 to sit on 13 under overall alongside Kiradech Aphibarnrat and Jazz Janewattananond.\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong boy, 16, admits joining pro-independence group based in Taiwan",
            "description": "A 16-year-old boy has admitted joining a Taiwan-based political group to seek Hong Kong’s independence in breach of the national security law.\\nThe Form Three student pleaded guilty on Friday to conspiracy to commit secession between November 2024 and July this year for his role as secretary of the Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union.\\nThe District Court heard that the union, founded by fugitive activist Alan Keung Ka-wai, advocated Hong Kong’s “liberation” from mainland Chinese rule, sought international recognition for a self-proclaimed “Hong Kong Parliament” and supported the establishment of an army to “restore and defend” the city.\\nSome of the party’s members were sworn in as so-called members of parliament after an election earlier this year, with Keung serving as the pseudo-legislature’s chairman.\\nOn the day of the union’s founding on November 6 last year, the boy approached Keung via WhatsApp expressing his interest in joining the group and saying he could help with his analytical and public speaking skills.\\nText conversations retrieved from the student’s mobile phone show that he had advised on the union’s name and emblem design, as well as drafting its constitution and meeting agendas.\\nThe defendant had also distributed the party’s promotional materials online and discussed with fellow members how to drum up anti-communist sentiments abroad, establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan and “settle the score” with mainland investments in Hong Kong after the city achieved independence.\\nA prosecution summary of the case highlighted the group’s illegal activities included social media posts promoting the self-styled parliament’s election and a flash-mob protest in Taiwan calling for Hong Kong’s independence.\\nNational security police first arrested the boy in March this year on suspicion of sedition.\\nUnder caution, he admitted publishing posters calling for support for the union in the so-called parliament’s election, but insisted that he disagreed with their content and that he only wanted to trigger online discussions on the subjects.\\nThe student remained silent when he was rearrested in July.\\nOn Friday, defence counsel David Ma Wai-kwan urged the court to consider sentencing his client to a period of detention at a juvenile facility, saying the boy had become inactive in the union since his first arrest.\\nBut Judge Ernest Michael Lin Kam-hung said his options would be limited if he decided that the boy was an active participant in the conspiracy, which would warrant a minimum jail term of three years under the national security law’s three-tier sentencing regime.\\nMa highlighted the student’s naivety and questioned whether it was right to assess his role in the scheme simply based on his unrealistic proposals for the party.\\nThe court adjourned sentencing until November 27. The boy, who was previously granted anonymity due to his young age, remains detained at the Tuen Mun Children and Juvenile Home.\\nTwo other defendants – courier Chan Tai-sum, 26, and waiter Ng Chi-tung, 25 – have yet to indicate their pleas on the same conspiracy charge. A pretrial hearing was scheduled for the pair at the District Court on the same day.\\n",

            "title": "China’s ‘tough’ trade war stance rests on industry but demand still vital: Morgan Stanley",
            "description": "China’s supply chain upgrades have strengthened its hand in negotiations with the United States and are expected to bolster its competitive edge over the next five years – though the country must prioritise domestic demand to sustain innovation and avoid worsening deflation, according to an influential economist.\\n“China is probably the only country that is negotiating in a tough way, almost on an equal foot[ing] versus [the] US,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, in an interview on Thursday. “That’s backed by China’s rising supply chain competitiveness and trade dominance”, he added, pointing to its near monopoly in crucial exports like lithium batteries and rare earths.\\n“In the next five years, China probably wants to continue to enhance what they have achieved,” Xing said.\\nBeijing on Tuesday released proposals for the 15th five-year plan – its socio-economic blueprint that outlines policy priorities for the next half-decade.\\nIndustrial and technological development featured prominently, with policymakers pledging to make a “decisive breakthrough” across the supply chains of critical industries – including semiconductors, infrastructure software and biomanufacturing.\\nThe proposals also called for maintaining a “reasonable” share of manufacturing in the economy while building a “unified domestic market” to underpin a new growth model. The central government vowed to tighten oversight of local economic initiatives, curb “race-to-the-bottom” competition and improve frameworks to evaluate performance, fiscal policy, statistics and benefit-sharing to support greater market integration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Xing, the document showed Beijing is recalibrating its industrial strategy to strike a balance between supply and demand – a likely shift from the current model, where local authorities offer subsidies to attract as much investment as possible, mainly to meet performance targets and boost local tax revenues.\\nThis latter approach risked keeping inefficient firms afloat and worsening overcapacity, he added.\\n“If [Beijing] leans heavily into the supply-centric policy mix, it’s going to make the current deflation problem more persistent,” Xing warned, adding that “deflation is partially contributed [to] by the prevailing supply-demand imbalance.”\\n“That’s why we are excited to see in the five-year plan statement that they are making some gradual pivot, trying to rebalance towards consumption.”\\nChina’s prior focus on bolstering industrial and innovation capacity through supply-side measures is now evolving into a more integrated strategy that connects supply- and demand-side policies to sustain innovation-driven growth, Xing said.\\n“If you have too little demand, firms will be racing to the bottom – that’s not ideal for innovation and R&amp;D.”\\nDespite being one of the world’s largest markets, China continues to grapple with weak consumer confidence and subdued household spending. Initiatives such as the trade-in programme – which encourages the purchase of home appliances, vehicles and digital goods – have not fully revived sentiment.\\nIn its new proposals, Beijing acknowledged that economic development remains “unbalanced and inadequate”, with domestic demand still insufficient.\\nConsumption as a percentage of gross domestic product is only 40 per cent, partly because people save too much\\nRobin Xing, Morgan Stanley\\nTo create a “virtuous cycle” between consumption, investment and production, policymakers pledged to increase investment in livelihood-related sectors, using “new demand to drive new supply, and new supply to create new demand”.\\nXing said the proposals showed that China would “definitely focus more” on boosting consumption. This could include strengthening social welfare to reduce household concerns and encourage spending.\\n“Consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product is only 40 per cent, partly because people save too much”, he said, citing concerns about unemployment, education, healthcare and retirement.\\nHe also suggested reforms that would make local governments more reliant on direct taxes – such as those on consumption, corporate income and personal income – incentivising them to promote household spending rather than just factory output.\\n“China has focused on investment in infrastructure and manufacturing in the last 20 years, but now they are shifting away from investing in physical infrastructure to investing in human capital,” Xing said. “That’s a good pivot.”\\n",
