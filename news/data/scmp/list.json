            "title": "Trump’s Asia tour made US distaste for multilateralism obvious",
            "description": "Despite the superficial conviviality of Donald Trump’s whistle-stop tour through Asia this week, we watched first-hand the dysfunctional reality of the US’ disengagement from the world of multilateralism.\\nTrump delivered a speech at the US-Asean Summit in Malaysia, but skipped the main Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ meeting in South Korea. Overall, he was more interested in cutting bilateral deals on the sidelines of the summits.\\nIn Malaysia, he finalised unilateral tariff agreements or frameworks with a handful of Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, but the substance of his discussions was elsewhere: rare-earths memorandums of understanding with Malaysia and Thailand, and a self-congratulatory celebration of his peacemaking skills in mediating an end to the Thailand-Cambodia conflict.\\nThe week also saw the first-ever meeting of leaders of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which has Asean at its core, but also includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\\nThe US is not part of RCEP, the world’s largest free-trade agreement, which covers 30 per cent of the world’s population and almost a third of global gross domestic product. For a unilateralist like Trump, such a grouping is clearly uninteresting.\\nTrump’s approach stands in contrast to that of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who spoke of the need to “jointly uphold free trade and the multilateral trading system, oppose all forms of protectionism, and further advance the process of regional economic integration”.\\n\\n\\nFrom Kuala Lumpur, Trump flew on to Tokyo to meet Japan’s new prime minister Sanae Takaichi, before continuing on to South Korea for the annual Apec summit in Gyeongju. Here again, Trump’s itinerary was an essentially unilateral affair. First, he addressed a gathering of corporate bosses at the Apec CEO Summit. Then he flew to Busan for his summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\nHe flew out of Korea before other leaders of the 21-member Apec forum began their discussions linked to Apec’s core objective of “free and open trade and investment” across the Asia-Pacific.\\nFor sure, Trump was under significant pressure to rush back to Washington, where the government has been shut down for almost five weeks. But anyway, the US president has no patience for Apec’s fundamental mission of building trust and multilateral cooperation. His “America first” agenda shares little in common with what Eduardo Pedrosa, executive director of Apec’s secretariat, on Monday applauded as “the steady process of building common ground in an increasingly divided world”.\\n\\n\\nThe US president’s appearances in Asia reflect the schizophrenic trade tensions that are likely to persist as long as Trump remains in power – a “world minus one” in which most nations remain convinced that multilateral cooperation is in the best interests of all, but in which the single most important economy has abandoned the need to make compromises and is set on bludgeoning any country that is perceived to obstruct US interests.\\nThere can be comfort in the past week’s steadfast endorsement at the Asean and Apec meetings of open trade and multilateral cooperation. Trump and his acolytes should note Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s remark in a recent interview: “The tariffs have certainly impacted America’s standing in Southeast Asia – there is no doubt.” They should also note that China, which since 2009 has been Asean’s largest trading partner, has been only too willing to fill the vacuum left by Trump’s transactional diplomacy.\\nBut it would be naive to think that we will not all be harmed by Trump’s attack on multilateral cooperation. Individual countries may suffer as unilaterally imposed tariffs squeeze their sales to one of the world’s most important markets. Even bigger casualties are likely to be the family of multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations.\\n\\n\\nTrump has sharply reduced funding to the UN’s regular budget and peacekeeping. He has frozen US$5 billion in foreign aid. He has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accord, World Health Organization, UN Human Rights Council and Unesco. He has disavowed the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals; the US ambassador to the UN in his Senate confirmation hearing said he wanted to ensure US funding “draws a straight and direct line to a compelling US national interest”.\\nTrump in February launched a comprehensive review of US engagement in all multilateral organisations, promising to deliver findings in August. The results of that review are long overdue, but that may just be a matter of keeping all in suspense and generating pressure for UN reform while a Damoclean sword is held overhead. As a commentary by the European Council on Foreign Relations observed in August, Trump may be “keeping one foot in wherever it deems convenient”.\\nAs Trump flew back to the US on Thursday, he was no doubt patting himself on the back for having successfully sealed a bundle of vote-winning bilateral tariff deals – not least his deal with China. But he should note that as he flew out, Xi Jinping was travelling on to Gyeongju for discussions with fellow Apec leaders. Most Apec economies have voiced a broad-based preference for multilateral cooperation. But as they glimpse Trump’s empty Apec seat across the room, they have to recognise that cooperation across a world minus one may be the best we can do for now.\\n",

            "description": "The Philippines’ culinary landscape has entered a new era with the debut of its inaugural Michelin Guide on October 30. It is a move that has bestowed international prestige upon a handful of Manila’s restaurants while igniting a fervent debate among food lovers about representation and the future of Filipino fine dining.\\nThe ceremony was held for the first time in the capital, at the Manila Marriott Hotel at Newport World Resorts. It recognised 108 establishments in total, awarding a combined 10 stars to nine restaurants, as well as 25 Bib Gourmands (for good value for money) and 74 “Michelin Selected” entries. It also presented three special awards.\\n“The new era is innovative yet rooted, contemporary yet unmistakably Filipino,” said Gwendal Poullennec, international director of the Michelin Guide. “It tells a story of heritage and innovations, where sweet, salty, sour and umami harmonise to create flavours that are both comforting and exciting. Filipino cuisine is bold, generous and deeply personal.”\\nThe inaugural Michelin star selection for the Philippines formally integrates key players on the dining scene into the global gastronomic landscape. The guide’s debut for Manila, its Environs and Cebu saw nine restaurants awarded stars, led by Helm in Makati City, which received the country’s highest honour of two Michelin stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by MICHELIN Guide (official) (@michelinguide)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe accolade, reserved for restaurants with “excellent cooking worth a detour”, was received by chef-owner Josh Boutwood, who is also the mastermind behind Ember, The Test Kitchen and Savage.\\nHelm was praised by the guide for its thematic tasting menus that blend “gastronomy and theatre in a truly boundary-breaking experience”, showcasing the chef’s “boundless creativity and masterful technique”.\\nIn an interview after the event, Boutwood was emotional as he shared that the award came as an “extreme surprise”.\\n“When [single] stars were being given out, I saw all my friends getting up, I thought they skipped ‘H’ in the alphabet. I texted my wife, ‘I think I don’t have it,’” he said. Moments later, Helm was announced as the first and only restaurant in the Philippines with two Michelin stars.\\nEight establishments earned one star, including Toyo Eatery by chef Jordy Navarra, who previously trained at Bo Innovation in Hong Kong.\\n\\nNavarra noted that this recognition for Filipino cuisine was overdue. “Every restaurant, every name that gets called – everyone getting celebrated – is such a great thing for our dining scene. We’ve known all along that we have something to show the world.”\\nThe ceremony also featured three special awards: the young chef award went to Don Baldosano of Linamnam; the service award to Erin Recto of Hapag; and the exceptional cocktails award to Benjamin Leal of Uma Nota.\\nAdditionally, a dedicated Michelin Green Star, recognising leadership in sustainability, was awarded to Gallery by Chele for its commitment to sustainability and championing of Filipino produce.\\nThe guide’s arrival establishes a new benchmark for the Philippines’ culinary industry, offering a structured international framework that is expected to influence local dining culture and the country’s appeal as a destination for gastronomic tourism.\\nBelow is the full list of awards included in the Philippines’ first Michelin Guide.\\n2 Michelin stars\\nHelm\\n1 Michelin star\\n\\nAsador Alfonso\\nCelera\\nGallery by Chele\\nHapag\\nInatô\\nKasa Palma\\nLinamnam\\nToyo Eatery\\nBib Gourmand list\\nAbaseria Deli &amp; Cafe\\nBolero\\nBrick Corner\\nCabel\\nCochi\\nCur8\\nEm Hà Nội\\nEsmen\\nHálong\\nKumba\\nLa Pita\\nLampara\\nLasa\\nLos Tacos\\nManam at The Triangle\\nMorning Sun Eatery\\nPalm Grill (Diliman)\\nPares Batchoy Food House\\nPilya’s Kitchen\\nSarsa\\nSome Thai\\nTaqueria Franco\\nThe Pig &amp; Palm\\nThe Underbelly\\nYour Local\\nMichelin Selected\\n12/10\\nAbli\\nAida’s Chicken\\nAntonio’s\\nAto-Ah\\nAurora\\nAutomat\\nAyà\\nBenjarong\\nBlackbird\\nButcher Boy\\nCantabria by Chele Gonzalez\\nCanton Road\\nCarmelo’s Steakhouse\\nChie Chie’s Pancit Batil Patung\\nChina Blue\\nCirkulo\\nCoco\\nCru Steakhouse\\nDeo Gracias\\nDip\\nEl Poco Cantina (Malate)\\nEmber\\nEnye by Chele Gonzales\\nEsmeralda Kitchen\\nFong Wei Wu\\nFresca Trattoria\\nGinza Nagaoka\\nGordon Ramsay Bar &amp; Grill\\nGoxo\\nHouse of Lechon\\nIai\\nJuniper\\nKamakura\\nKei\\nKodawari (Salcedo)\\nLantaw (Compostela)\\nLocavore (Taguig)\\nLola Helen\\nLore\\nLusso (Legazpi)\\nMamacita\\nMan Ho\\nMaya\\nMetiz\\nMirèio\\nMōdan\\nNow Now\\nOak &amp; Smoke\\nOffbeat\\nOld Manila\\nOrigine\\nOsteria Antica\\nPablo\\nPapillon\\nPares Pares (N.

            "description": "Motorists from four Guangdong cities will be able to apply to enter Hong Kong under a new travel scheme from Saturday, while applications to drive into urban areas will open on December 9, the government has announced.\\nThe government said on Friday that applications for the “Park &amp; Fly” car park at the port would open at 9am on November 1, with operations commencing at midnight on November 15.\\nBoth sides also agreed that eligible mainland applicants may submit applications from 9am on December 9 to drive into Hong Kong’s urban area via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, starting from midnight on December 23, following agreements between the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments.\\nTo ensure orderly implementation, the scheme will initially accept applications from four Guangdong cities – Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen – before gradually extending to other cities in the province after six months.\\nUnder the “Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles” scheme, eligible private cars from Guangdong can park at the automated car parks at the Hong Kong Port of the bridge.\\nDrivers and passengers may then transfer to flights via Hong Kong International Airport.\\nThe port offers 1,800 parking spaces with 24-hour automated parking and drop-off or pickup services.\\n\\nAlternatively, participants may enter Hong Kong using local transport or drive directly into the city via the bridge without obtaining a regular quota.\\nFor motorists wishing to enter the city’s urban area, the daily quota is set at 100 vehicles, with each vehicle allowed to stay in the city for up to three days. Applicants must first register for computer-based balloting through Guangdong’s information platform.\\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the scheme, along with its northbound counterpart allowing Hong Kong vehicles to travel to the mainland, complemented each other in promoting the integrated development of the Greater Bay Area (GBA).\\n“The Hong Kong government is taking forward the Southbound Travel Scheme in a steady manner, with a view to benefitting Hong Kong residents and society as a whole, as well as sharing the fruitful achievements of the integrated development of the GBA,” he said.\\nThose utilising the scheme are expected to be high-spending individuals and families. The government will provide tourist parking guides to help participants plan their itineraries, offering suggested options related to transport, culture, sports, exhibitions, shopping and theme parks.\\nThe Guangdong Provincial Government also announced on Friday the regulations for the port car parks and urban entry under the Southbound Travel Scheme. These include detailed eligibility requirements for applicants, vehicles and drivers, insurance rules, port clearance procedures, driving necessities and mechanisms for handling non-compliance.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s party district Lan Kwai Fong could see a 20 to 25 per cent jump in business this Halloween compared with last year, according to a nightlife tycoon, who cited a “crazy” week-long build-up of costumed revellers and “fully booked” venues.\\nLan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman, also dubbed the father of the nightlife district in Central, joined in the festivities leading up to Halloween by cosplaying as the character Wednesday from the Addams Family while walking on a red carpet in a public appearance earlier this month to help promote tourism in the city.\\nWith so many revellers expected to crowd the streets at Lan Kwai Fong, police imposed special traffic arrangements by closing roads in the area from 2pm in D’Aguilar Street between Wyndham Street and Wellington Street, Lan Kwai Fong, Wing Wah Lane, Wo On Lane, Wellington Street between Wyndham Street and D’Aguilar Street and On Lan Street.\\nPolice warned that more roads in the area could be sealed off depending on the crowd situation.\\nZeman said on Friday his forecast was based on business being “much, much better” in recent months and the festival falling on a Friday.\\n“I’m looking at anywhere from 20 per cent, 25 per cent above last year. Lan Kwai Fong has been crazy with many, many people dressed up in different costumes … all week. So there’s a momentum building for tonight,” he said.\\n“We have a lot of pre-bookings. A lot of the bars and restaurants have been booked, fully booked, actually.\\n“Business the last few months has been much, much better in Hong Kong and Lan Kwai Fong. So I’m expecting it’ll be very, very good.”\\n\\nZeman added that Halloween coinciding on Friday would make it “a very good night”, because people could stay out late given that fewer people worked on the weekend.\\nLan Kwai Fong Association’s director Anthea Cheung said some operators had launched “Halloween party tickets with early bird discounts to drive pre-bookings”.\\nShe said restaurants at Lan Kwai Fong were using “structured first and second seating sessions” and bars were “promoting free-flow drink packages to ensure higher per-capita spend”.\\nHowever, Ben Leung Lap-yan, charter president of the Licensed Bar and Club Association of Hong Kong, raised operators’ concerns about a repeat of history in recent years that revellers packed streets without spending, which forced them to lower prices at the expense of their profit margins to attract customers.\\n“This is of course a problem that our industry operators are worried about,” Leung said.\\n“After all, Hong Kong’s high rent and high wages are also putting pressure on our operators. Consumers are also inclined to choose high value-for-money options.”\\nBut Zeman rejected the idea that low spending was a new norm, arguing the problem was limited to unpopular venues and that “Lan Kwai Fong is not a cheap place”.\\n“The good operators, their businesses have been very decent,” Zeman said.\\n",

            "description": "Robot dogs might not be able to survive a potential assault on Taiwan, based on the results of an amphibious landing exercise carried out by the People’s Liberation Army and broadcast in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV.\\nThe four-legged robots, loaded with explosives, were released by the first wave of landing forces in the exercise. They ran across ditches, blocks and barricades on the beachhead in an attempt to clear a passage for the penetration of the enemy defensive line.\\nAt the same time, first-person view (FPV) unmanned aerial vehicles were deployed by specialised drone units to strike the enemy firing positions along with armed combat troops, providing fire suppression for the robot dogs, the documentary showed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughout the operation, reconnaissance drones monitored the battlefield and ascertained enemy positions while more robot dogs could be seen serving as ammunition transporters for soldiers deployed in scattered positions.\\nMeanwhile, another robot dog with a machine gun on its back accompanied a team of paratroopers advancing through the jungle to infiltrate the enemy’s rear, then led the way to intercept enemy reinforcements.\\nThis happened after the drill director declared that the PLA’s amphibious armoured vehicles were damaged by defensive artillery, causing congestion on the advance route in the full-course amphibious landing exercise, according to CCTV.\\nThe operation’s wide use and seamless integration of the systems indicated that the PLA has adapted to unmanned warfare and developed significant capabilities. However, the results of the drill also appear to reveal the limitations of military drones.\\nAccording to the documentary, a defending soldier was able to shoot down a robot dog from a distance as it moved on the open beach. And the FPV drones did not seem to have weakened the fortified enemy positions.\\n\\n\\n“Under the circumstances that the unmanned equipment had already been destroyed, we were forced to resort to the most primitive approach – using humans,” landing unit commander Ren Mengqi told CCTV.\\nThe crude and dangerous method – attempting to breach a path by ordering soldiers to crawl under heavy fire and place explosive charges by hand – resulted in “heavy casualties”, he said.\\nThe documentary also showed that the defences on the beach were not cleared until the infiltration team launched an attack from behind.\\nThe report did not specify the time or location of the drill, but some of the footage was previously aired in Forging Ahead, a documentary series commemorating Army Day on August 1, which included scenes drawn from the Strait Thunder 2025A exercise in April.\\nBeijing regards Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise the island as independent, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take it by force and is committed to supplying Taipei with arms.\\nThe PLA has intensified its posture around the self-ruling island in recent years, particularly after the pro-independence Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te took office last year and made a series of remarks that repeatedly angered Beijing.\\nStrait Thunder 2025A was one of at least six large-scale joint exercises around Taiwan conducted by the PLA since August 2022, each featuring different manoeuvres and showcasing new operational abilities.\\n",

            "description": "The first meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung could not have gone off to a better start, with analysts noting the two leaders’ warm rapport sealed with handshakes, smiles and vows to look to the future.\\nWhile they projected goodwill during their summit ahead of the Apec forum in the South Korean city of Gyeongju on Thursday, long-standing tensions over history and territorial disputes, and domestic political pressures arising from the bilateral ties are likely to resurface at some point, according to analysts.\\n“For now, they appear to be putting very positive faces on, but there are a lot of potential obstacles ahead,” said Ben Ascione, an assistant professor of politics and international relations at Tokyo’s Waseda University.\\n“When Takaichi was first elected head of the Liberal Democratic Party and then prime minister, there was a lot of fear that this was going to spell doom”, following recent progress in Tokyo’s relations with Seoul and Beijing, Ascione told This Week in Asia.\\nThere have been concerns that her position on the region’s shared history, her past visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and the right flank of her Liberal Democratic Party ignoring “Japan’s colonial and historic transgressions” could cause friction between Japan and its neighbours, he added.\\nWhile it was still early in their diplomatic relationship, the two leaders’ focus on the future rather than the past was a positive, Ascione said.\\n“They avoided the worst possible outcome in their first meeting, but it remains to be seen whether this cooperation will be substantive and can be solidified under Takaichi’s leadership,” he said.\\n\\nIn their first summit, just before the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Takaichi and Lee agreed to strengthen existing cooperation and shuttle diplomacy between Tokyo and Seoul.\\nTakaichi, who was elected prime minister nine days earlier and was facing her second major diplomatic test after hosting US President Donald Trump in Tokyo on Tuesday, described the two countries as “important neighbours”. She also used the occasion to underline the growing importance of the three-way security cooperation with the US at a time of challenges to regional security.\\nIn return, Lee said Japan and South Korea were “neighbours who share many similarities” and should work together to boost ties at a time of worsening global uncertainty.\\nBoth leaders described their discussions as cordial and forward-looking and spoke about the possibility of Tokyo hosting their next face-to-face meeting.\\nNeither Takaichi nor Lee made any mention of wartime “comfort women,” Koreans who were forced to work in Japanese mines and heavy industries during Tokyo’s colonial control of the peninsula or ongoing disagreements over the sovereignty of islands in the disputed Sea of Japan, or East Sea, analysts have noted.\\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the two leaders had opted for a pragmatic approach.\\n“The theme of the Lee-Takaichi summit was ‘if it’s fixed, don’t break it’,” he said. “Both leaders deserve credit for their pragmatism in putting economic and security interests above partisan politics and contested history.”\\n\\nThat was echoed in the South Korean media, with an opinion article in the Chosun newspaper suggesting Takaichi had adopted a “pragmatic diplomatic framework”. It pointed out that Takaichi had already skipped one opportunity since being elected prime minister this month to pay her respects at Yasukuni, where the souls of Japan’s war dead include 14 class A war criminals.\\nJapanese media took a similar position, with the left-leaning Asahi applauding the prime minister for getting the relationship “off to a safe start” and the Nikkei Shimbun mentioning the two leaders’ “realist diplomacy”.\\nThe media outlets in the two countries have also emphasised that it is of critical importance for Tokyo and Seoul to form a firm alliance due to the common security challenges they face and Washington’s inconsistent approach to regional security and diplomacy.\\n“My first impressions are quite positive,” said Hiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University. “Before they met, there were concerns that Takaichi might take a harder line or even act provocatively, but as far as we can tell, she has been very careful and reserved.\\n“Takaichi is, of course, worried about the security situation in the region and wants to build on the trilateral alliance with the US and South Korea. This was an important first step in achieving that.”\\nThe real test will come when the first bumps of their relationship surface, according to Murakami.\\n“The same issues that caused problems in the past still exist. But it is the same for Lee, and it will be in his best interests to also try to avoid those issues and quickly overcome them when they need to. They will both need to be pragmatic.”\\n",

            "description": "The ex-girlfriend of a fugitive Hong Kong activist has pleaded guilty to sedition under the domestic national security law for promoting a self-styled parliament-in-exile in Canada seeking to overthrow the city government.\\nBettie Lan Fei, 19, on Friday admitted breaching the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance for helping produce two promotional videos for the “Hong Kong Parliament” and rallying support for the organisation in private messages to a friend between March and May this year.\\nWest Kowloon Court heard how the jobless defendant accepted a C$200 reward to appear in videos encouraging Hongkongers to vote in the group’s election, after being convinced by her then partner, Tony Lam, that her actions would not violate the law.\\nThe self-proclaimed parliament aims to achieve Hong Kong independence, eliminate the Communist Party of China and promote the international recognition of the party as a transnational criminal organisation, according to a prosecution case summary.\\nNational security police have issued HK$200,000 bounties for 15 overseas Hongkongers for their involvement in the group, including 36-year-old Lam, who ran in the poll and was sworn in as a so-called parliament member.\\nIn two promotional videos dated April and May 2025, Lan, who was portrayed as a “new-generation Hongkonger”, described the group as fighting for residents’ rights and helping their jailed “comrades”. She also called on the audience to cast a vote via a mobile app.\\nUpon her arrest in July this year, police discovered Instagram messages on her mobile phone in which she encouraged a friend to join the vote.\\n\\nLan told police that she had filmed the videos abroad at her ex-boyfriend’s instructions, but denied ever voting at the election or joining the group in any capacity.\\nShe said Victor Ho Leung-mau, a co-founder of the group’s now-dissolved electoral committee, provided her with the scripts and paid her C$100 for each video appearance.\\nThe defendant pleaded guilty to a count of “doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention”, which is punishable by up to seven years in jail.\\nAny Hong Kong resident committing sedition outside the city can be held liable for the crime under the ordinance, which was enacted as a requirement of Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.\\nIn court, Chief Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak questioned the degree of Lan’s involvement and noted a social media message that appeared to suggest she was originally slated to work for the group as a “councillor assistant”.\\nDefence counsel Luke McGuinniety said the text was written without his client’s knowledge and stressed she had no intention to join the parliament or take part in its future elections.\\nMcGuinniety described the defendant as a young and naive woman who toed the line and followed her then boyfriend’s ill-gotten advice.\\nHe said Lan had become dependent on Lam after moving to Canada due to her inability to communicate in English and her difficulties adjusting to the new environment.\\nAfter the couple broke up, the 19-year-old thought that she could wipe her slate clean by returning to Hong Kong, the lawyer continued.\\n“It’s an indication of her naivety and total lack of understanding of the significance of her actions, the criminality of her involvement … She came back to Hong Kong completely unaware of the stupidity of her actions,” McGuinniety said.\\n“The obsession for likes, fanfare and approval may very well be what trapped this woman.”\\nThe court adjourned sentencing until November 13, pending a background assessment of the defendant.\\nLan, who has been detained since her prosecution in August, remains in custody.\\n",

            "description": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said military ties with India have “never been stronger” following a meeting with his counterpart Rajnath Singh, signalling that trade tensions have not affected broader strategic cooperation.\\nDuring the Friday meeting, the two renewed a 10-year defence framework, with Hegseth calling the India-US partnership “one of the most consequential” in the world. This was their first in-person meeting and took place on the sidelines of a gathering of defence chiefs from Asean in Kuala Lumpur.\\n“This new 10-year defence framework we signed is ambitious,” Hegseth added. “It’s a significant step for our two militaries, a road map for deeper and even more meaningful collaboration ahead.”\\nSingh said that the framework will “open new doors” to bilateral ties.\\nRelations between New Delhi and Washington have deteriorated sharply in recent months, following the Trump administration’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports – partly as punishment for purchases of Russian oil. Still, despite the tensions, the two sides have maintained defence ties and continued joint military exercises.\\n\\n\\nWashington has long positioned India as a strategic counterweight to an increasingly assertive China in the Indo-Pacific, a role likely to remain intact even amid trade-related hostilities.\\nEarlier in the day, Hegseth voiced serious concerns in talks with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun about Beijing’s naval activity around Taiwan and the South China Sea, citing its impact on US security partners in the region.\\nWhile signs of a thaw have emerged in trade relations between India and the US, Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped the Asean summit to avoid a meeting with President Donald Trump.\\n",

            "description": "A Malaysian man, 33, has been sentenced to a decade in jail for manslaughter after accidentally killing his girlfriend’s three-year-old daughter by stepping on the child’s chest as he entered the room in darkness to feed her.\\nAhmad Ashraf, a technician who weighed 138kg (300lbs) at the time, was caring for the toddler on July 20, 2022, in his home in Kota Tinggi, as his girlfriend was ill and receiving hospital treatment.\\nAccording to local Chinese-language newspaper Sin Chew Daily, the child started to hyperventilate and Ashraf immediately turned the light on, attempting to give first aid before taking her to hospital, where she died from her injuries.\\nHe surrendered himself to police later the same day.\\nAt the sentencing on Thursday, a reportedly slimmer Ashraf confessed to manslaughter without intent to kill. The prosecution had pressed for a sentence of no fewer than 12 years behind bars.\\nThe judge took into account leniency factors, including his cooperation in the investigation and the absence of any aggression.\\nThe court was told Ashraf had asked his girlfriend for forgiveness and reflected deeply on the tragedy.\\n",
