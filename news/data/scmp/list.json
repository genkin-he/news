            "description": "US Vice-President J.D. Vance has defended his hopes that his wife Usha, who was raised as a Hindu, converts to Christianity.\\nA fervent Catholic who himself converted in 2019, Vance said on Friday that pushback against his remarks reeks of “anti-Christian bigotry”.\\nThe 41-year-old was asked about raising their three children in an interfaith marriage at a Turning Point USA event honouring assassinated right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday.\\n“Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that,” he said.\\n“But if she doesn’t, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn’t cause a problem for me.”\\n\\nVance, who has been tipped by US President Donald Trump as a likely candidate in the 2028 US election, then responded to criticism of his remarks on social media.\\nReplying to one critic who accused him on social media of throwing the second lady’s religion “under the bus” to placate right-wingers, Vance replied: “What a disgusting comment, and it’s hardly been the only one along these lines.”\\n“She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage – or any interfaith relationship – I hope she may one day see things as I do,” Vance wrote.\\nUsha Vance was born in San Diego to parents who emigrated from India. She told Fox News in 2024 that her parents’ Hindu religion helped make them “really good people”.\\nVance was raised as an evangelical in a chaotic and sometimes deprived upbringing that he described in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy.\\nThe couple met at Yale Law School and married in 2014.\\nSince Vance’s conversion to Catholicism five years later, he has frequently spoken about how his faith has informed his conservative political views.\\n",

            "title": "Is Andrew’s royal exit the biggest Windsor crisis since Edward VIII’s abdication?",
            "description": "Holding prestige but not power, Britain’s monarchy is finely tuned to public sentiment.\\nThat has been evident with the disgrace of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who was stripped of his princely title and his spacious home by his brother King Charles on Thursday, a banishment that has left the disgraced royal increasingly exposed to scrutiny both in the UK and the US over his friendship with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\\nFollowing years of scandals related to Andrew, Charles arguably took the biggest step of his reign by seeking to insulate the monarchy from any further scandals relating to Andrew and his connections with Epstein, who took his own life in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, more than a decade after his initial conviction.\\nIt’s not the first time the current iteration of the British monarchy – the House of Windsor – has been in crisis over the past century and where the future of the institution has been threatened.\\n\\nWorld War I\\nGeorge Gross, a royal expert at King’s College London, said the most recent precedent for what has happened to Andrew is the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act, which “saw various members of loosely affiliated royals and dukes and members of the peerage losing titles if they had sided with Germany in the First World War”.\\nThe royal families of Europe are intertwined, and Britain’s is heavily German, especially after Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, with whom she had nine children.\\nWhen Britain and Germany went to war in 1914, some members of the wider British royal family found themselves on opposing sides.\\nBritain’s King George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917, and initiated legislation to strike out the titles of princes and lords “who have, during the present war, borne arms against His Majesty or His Allies, or who have adhered to His Majesty’s enemies”.\\nOne target was Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who was a UK royal and also a prince of Hanover. His title was removed for being an enemy of Britain under the 1917 act, which was enacted in 1919, once the war was over.\\nAccording to the House of Commons Library, “this was the first and only time such a title has been removed in this way.”\\nThe abdication\\nThe relationship between Edward, Prince of Wales, and US socialite Wallis Simpson was a headache that turned into a constitutional crisis. Simpson was twice divorced, and Edward, the heir to the throne, was destined to be ceremonial head of the Church of England, which did not allow divorced people to remarry in church.\\nThe prince became King Edward VIII when his father, King George V, died in early 1936. He continued to say he wanted to marry Simpson, despite the opposition of the British government.\\nForced to choose between duty and passion, he gave up the throne in December 1936, announcing in a radio broadcast that “I have found it impossible … to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love”.\\nThe news was a surprise to many in Britain, though not beyond it. British newspapers had not reported on the relationship, and American magazines had offending articles cut out before going on sale.\\nThe abdication set the monarchy on a new course. Edward’s younger brother took the throne as King George VI. He was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, and after her 70-year reign by her son, King Charles III. All doubled down on the idea that the monarch’s primary attribute should be a sense of duty – something Edward, in the popular imagination, lacked.\\nEdward and Wallis, now the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and suspected by some of Nazi sympathies, were sent to the Bahamas, where he served as governor. After the war, they mostly stayed away from Britain, living a life of nomadic luxury.\\n\\nPrincess Diana’s death\\nThe death of Princess Diana – the ex-wife of Charles – in a car crash in Paris in 1997 at the age of 36 shocked the world and left her family, including sons William and Harry, then 15 and 12, in mourning.\\nThe strength of public feeling caught the royal family by surprise. Mounds of floral tributes piled up outside the gates of Buckingham Palace and Diana’s Kensington Palace home to mourn a princess who had been ostracised by the royal family after her divorce from Charles in 1992.\\nThe queen was at Balmoral in Scotland on her summer holiday with her husband Prince Philip, Charles, William and Harry. The family kept their grief private and stuck to routine – taking the ashen-faced boys to church on Sunday morning – and the queen did not issue a statement for several days.\\nShe was advised to make a public display of grief by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who perfectly caught the public mood with his own tribute, calling Diana “the people’s princess”.\\nAfter newspaper headlines urging “Speak to us Ma’am” and “Show us you care”, the queen made a live televised address to the nation on the eve of Diana’s funeral.\\n“What I say to you now, as your queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart,” the queen said, acknowledging the country’s grief, praising Diana and promising to cherish her memory.\\n\\nThe trouble with Harry\\nUntil the Epstein scandal reared up again last year, Andrew had been trying to regain favour with the family. He may have benefited indirectly from the trouble with Prince Harry, who was the source of most of the drama at the time outside the family’s high-profile medical problems.\\nHarry became estranged from his father and older brother, Prince William, heir to the throne, when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from their working roles and moved to California in 2020.\\nThe couple famously aired their grievances with the royal family in a tell-all interview to Oprah Winfrey and a revealing Netflix series. Harry, also known as the Duke of Sussex, then fuelled the tensions by revealing personal conversations in his memoir, Spare.\\n\\nHarry also broke from royal protocol in turning to the courts to sort out his legal problems. He became the first senior royal to testify in court in more than a century in his successful phone hacking lawsuit against the Daily Mirror.\\nA failed legal effort to restore his police protection detail that was stripped from him when he left royal work, though, was seen as an attack on his father’s government.\\nWhen the courts finally rejected the lawsuit, it provided a chance for a reunion between father and son. The two shared a cup of tea at Charles’ London abode, Clarence House, in September. It was their first meeting in over a year. It lasted less than an hour.\\n",

            "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario’s premier not to run an anti-tariff advertisement that prompted US President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada.\\nCarney also confirmed that he apologised to the president during a dinner at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because Trump was “offended”.\\nOntario’s television advertisement that aired in the US criticises Trump’s tariffs by citing a speech from former US President Ronald Reagan.\\nThe ad infuriated Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10 per cent.\\nWhen asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, “Well, you saw what came of it”.\\n“It’s not something I would have done,” Carney added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.\\nFord is a populist Conservative, while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a US governor.\\n\\n“I’m the one who is responsible, in my role as prime minister, for the relationship with the president of the US, and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the US government,” Carney said.\\nA spokesperson for Ford didn’t immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad.\\nFord previously said Carney and Carney’s chief of staff watched the ad before it was released.\\nFord pulled the ad last Monday but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the baseball World Series.\\nTrump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario’s ad, spelling out the case against them.\\nTrump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the US Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.\\n\\n\\nCarney met with Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminium. Tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminium, steel, auto and timber sectors.\\nMore than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the US, and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.\\n",

            "description": "Kai Tak Arena came alive on Saturday night, but a fevered home support could not prevent Hong Kong’s fast and physical opening National Games handball clash ending in defeat by Anhui.\\nAlthough the venue was still less than half full for the hosts’ match, after just a few hundred spectators had turned up to be royally entertained by the opening three games, the local side received noisy and incessant backing. The decibel levels peaked when Hong Kong drew level at 28-28 with six minutes remaining.\\nAnhui errors were cheered, and their infringements met with piercing whistles and jeers.

Hong Kong face Shanghai on Sunday in a match Ekdahl Du Rietz said his side would start as 60-40 favourites. “We have to forget today and move on,” he added.\\n“In the first half, I saw players doing things they wouldn’t normally, their movements weren’t as smooth, but hopefully that’s behind us now.”\\nIn the other Group B game, Macau’s collection of “firemen, policemen and bankers” were steamrollered 40-15 by Beijing.\\nThe top four in each of two five-team groups will advance to Friday’s last-eight matches.\\nThe triumphant Beijing players ambled haughtily past the media without uttering a word, before Victor Lei Un-wai, the Macau captain, stopped to reveal that his side had been plagued by pre-match nerves.\\n“None of us can sleep at night – we have very few chances to play big games against professionals,” said Lei, whose team are making their Games debut.\\n“It’s very tough for us, it’s just a hobby, and it’s only in the past month we got our team together. I’m the only one who has a job in handball: I coach and work on the games staff.

            "title": "Will Trump’s call to resume nuclear testing fuel a US-China arms race?",
            "description": "US President Donald Trump’s call to “immediately” resume testing of nuclear weapons, citing Beijing and Moscow’s rapid nuclear build-up, could drive China to “accelerate” its own efforts to develop its strategic forces, according to analysts.\\nOn Thursday, Trump posted on social media that he had instructed the Pentagon to start testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China because of “other countries’ testing programmes”.\\n“That process will begin immediately,” Trump said in a post published just a few minutes before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.\\nTrump said that while the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country – followed by Russia in second place and China as a “distant” third – Moscow and Beijing’s nuclear forces would catch up with Washington within five years.\\nIn response to Trump’s order, the United Nations issued a rare direct rebuke.\\n“We shouldn’t forget the disastrous legacy of over 2,000 nuclear-weapons tests that have been carried out over the last 80 years,” UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on Thursday. He said the UN and Secretary General Antonio Guterres believed “nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances”.\\nThe US conducted its last nuclear test in 1992, the same year George H.W. Bush, US president at the time, issued a moratorium on nuclear tests.\\nIn 1996, the multilateral Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty was adopted by the UN General Assembly. The US, China and Russia signed the treaty that year but did not ratify it. While Russia then ratified the treaty in 2000, Russian President Vladimir Putin revoked the ratification in 2023.\\n\\n\\nTrump did not specify which nuclear weapons tests should resume.\\nTimothy Heath, a senior international defence researcher at the US-based Rand Corporation, said Trump might have been referring to missile test launches, which could be used to deliver nuclear weapons.\\n“Russia and China have done such missile launches for ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, some of which could deliver nuclear weapons,” Heath said.\\n“Maybe Trump wants to detonate a nuclear weapon to test it. However, this would represent a striking change from recent years ... In short, it’s not clear what sort of tests Trump had in mind.”\\nTong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said China would “need time to assess what policy changes may follow” Trump’s order.\\nZhao said at the strategic level, Trump’s threat to resume nuclear testing could partly be intended to “pressure China to curb its rapid nuclear build-up and join arms control negotiations”.\\n“However, given Beijing’s strong commitment to ‘strengthening and enlarging’ its nuclear arsenal – recently reaffirmed at the fourth plenum of the [Communist Party Central Committee] – China is unlikely to slow its pace,” Zhao said.\\n“On the contrary, the threat may prompt Beijing to accelerate preparations to resume nuclear explosive testing, if not double down on its broader nuclear modernisation and expansion efforts.”\\nHe said Trump’s “unexpected” post might have been triggered by Russia’s back-to-back testing of two new types of exotic nuclear weapon delivery systems over the past few days, with Trump’s remark a likely reference to the US starting to develop similar technology.\\nPutin announced this week that his country had tested a new long-range nuclear-powered underwater weapon as well as a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable cruise missile.\\n“Consequently, there would be a significant likelihood that Beijing would follow suit. China has reportedly already engaged in research on new and nontraditional nuclear delivery technologies,” Zhao said.\\n“Continued Russian progress in this field, combined with parallel US efforts, could further motivate China to accelerate its own research programme to avoid falling behind.”\\nHeath said Trump’s instructions might have been made with Beijing’s nuclear capabilities in mind.\\n“China is rapidly expanding its inventory, and Russia has shown that it is still developing new missiles and underwater systems to deliver nuclear weapons,” Heath said. “The US will probably follow this trend in modernising its nuclear forces as well.”\\nHeath said that the nuclear arms build-up was not just accelerating because of Trump’s comments.\\nBeijing pledged to “strengthen strategic deterrence capabilities, [and] safeguard global strategic balance and stability” as part of its proposed blueprint for the 15th five-year plan, which was endorsed last week by the party’s Central Committee and will cover the years 2026-2030. The Chinese government often uses the phrase “strategic deterrence” to refer to nuclear forces.\\nAccording to a June report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China has added 100 warheads to its nuclear stockpile each year since 2023, making it the “fastest growing nuclear arsenal in the world”.\\nThe SIPRI report estimated that China held at least 600 warheads, which was expected to “keep growing over the coming decade”, while the US had a total inventory of 5,177 warheads, of which 3,700 were in military stockpiles. Meanwhile, Russia had 5,459 warheads, of which 4,309 were in military stockpiles, it said.\\nAccording to a Pentagon report on China’s military development, China is projected to reach around 1,000 warheads by 2030.\\nWhile China’s last known nuclear test took place in 1996, it has continued to test nuclear-capable missiles, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and hypersonic missiles.\\nThe Trump administration has tried to add China to discussions to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start). The treaty was signed between Washington and Moscow in 2010 and capped the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads on ICBMs and delivery systems to 1,550. It will expire in February next year.\\nBeijing has rejected the idea, and the issue did not come up in the Xi-Trump summit on Thursday.\\n",

            "title": "Why China chose tech-hub Shenzhen to host the 2026 Apec summit",
            "description": "China’s decision to host next year’s Apec summit in the innovation hub of Shenzhen reflects Beijing’s “resolve to uphold openness”, according to analysts.\\nHighlighting the southern city’s spectacular growth over the past few decades, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the decision at the end of the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Saturday.\\n“Located on the Pacific coast and adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has transformed from a backward fishing village into a modern international metropolis in just a few decades,” Xi said.\\n“Together with surrounding areas, it forms the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, which can be considered a growth pole of the world economy.”\\n\\n\\nAnalysts said China’s choice of Shenzhen as the host city reflected various considerations, including the desire to highlight the country’s gains in economic development.\\nZhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s school of international studies, described Shenzhen as “a landmark city symbolising China’s economic integration with the world”.\\nSelecting Shenzhen would demonstrate to the world “the alignment and integration of China’s economic development with the global economy following reform and opening up”, Zhu said.\\nThe message could be amplified if US President Donald Trump decides to attend the gathering.\\nDuring talks before the Apec summit on Thursday, Xi and Trump extended invitations for reciprocal state visits.\\nState news agency Xinhua also quoted Trump as saying that the United States would be happy to see the success of both next year’s Apec meeting in China and the G20 summit in Miami.\\nZhu said that if there was frequent high-level dialogue between the two countries next year, “the likelihood of Trump attending a summit in Shenzhen is considerable”.\\nIn that case, the Shenzhen summit would serve as “a significant diplomatic opportunity to further strengthen the strategic relationship between the two nations’ leaders”, he said.\\nZhu added that a summit in Shenzhen could also provide “a crucial diplomatic occasion for further integration into the global and Western spheres” for US-sanctioned enterprises, including telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, which is headquartered in the city.\\nThis would also enable China to “further reduce the excessive focus on security in US-China relations”, according to Zhu.\\n\\n\\nShenzhen has grown exponentially from its fishing village roots more than four decades ago to become a city of nearly 18 million people.\\nIt is also one of China’s leading centres for hi-tech innovation, including artificial intelligence and other areas of strict competition with the US.\\nBut while it is China’s “most successful special economic zone”, it simultaneously “endures the most severe blows from trade protectionism and technological decoupling”, according to Peng Peng, executive chairman of the Guangdong Society of Reform, a think tank affiliated with the Guangdong provincial government.\\nAccording to Peng, selecting Shenzhen as the Apec host city demonstrated China’s “resolve to uphold openness and continue guiding the direction of globalisation”.\\nFurthermore, a summit in Shenzhen would enable “the world, particularly major nations, to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the Greater Bay Area’s development progress and overall strength”.\\nShenzhen is one of nine cities in Guangdong that make up the Greater Bay Area, which also includes the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\\nIn recent years, Beijing has sought to transform the Greater Bay Area into a world-class economic and innovation hub.\\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the announcement about Shenzhen made him feel “motivated”, and the city would do its best to support the Apec meeting next year.\\n“We are thrilled … Shenzhen is our close neighbour. Our relationship is very close,” he said.\\n“The Hong Kong government is fully prepared and will be very excited to be able to support the organisation and success of the Apec conference.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeng said Hong Kong could be the first stop for some Apec leaders on their way to the summit, given that Hong Kong operated more international flight routes than Shenzhen.\\nHe said the provincial capital Guangzhou, which hosts a number of consulates, could also feature on leaders’ itineraries.\\nThe overall effects would be “positive and beneficial” but it was difficult now to “comprehensively assess the spillover effects” of the Apec summit on other cities in the Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, he said.\\nIn recent years, China has selected lesser-known cities to host multilateral diplomatic events, aiming to boost their international profile.\\nFor example, the northern port city of Tianjin hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit earlier this year while the coastal city of Qingdao was the backdrop for the bloc’s gathering in 2018.\\nOther cases include the 2016 G20 summit in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the 2017 Brics summit in the southeastern coastal city of Xiamen, and the 2023 China-Central Asia Summit in western city of Xian.\\nShenzhen will be the third Chinese city to host the Apec meeting – Shanghai hosted in 2001 and Beijing in 2014.\\nOn Friday, Xi called on world leaders to uphold multilateralism and ensure supply chain stability.\\nIn a separate address on Saturday, the Chinese leader warned of intensifying challenges such as climate change and energy security, calling on regional economies to deepen cooperation and “seize new opportunities”.\\nXi said countries should promote the “sound and orderly development of artificial intelligence while ensuring that it is beneficial, safe and fair”.\\nXi arrived in South Korea on Thursday and held talks with various world leaders on the sidelines of the forum.\\nThese included South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.\\nSeparately, Apec member states wrapped up the two-day summit with a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen economic cooperation to navigate the changing global conditions.\\nThe declaration warned that the Asia-Pacific region stood at a “pivotal juncture” and acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges”.\\n“We reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and remain committed to deepening economic cooperation to navigate the evolving global environment,” it said.\\n“We acknowledge the importance of a trade and investment environment that promotes resilience and benefits for all.”\\nThe declaration also called for efforts to ensure the resilience of supply chains, and urged cooperation in AI as well as coordination to respond to global challenges including in areas of energy and food security.\\nAdditional reporting by Willa Wu\\n",

            "title": "National Games are just the start, not finishing line, of sporting ambitions",
            "description": "The news that Hong Kong would co-host China’s National Games for the first time, a landmark for the city, was not accompanied by the fanfare that might have been expected when it was announced four years ago.\\nAt the time, the world was still in the grip of the pandemic. Hong Kong’s measures to combat Covid-19, including quarantine and strict social-distancing rules, hit the city’s sports sector hard.\\nIconic events such as the rugby sevens, the marathon and Oxfam Trailwalker were cancelled or scaled down. International competitions moved elsewhere. Sports venues, leagues and gyms closed.\\nThere was, for a time, even a requirement that masks be worn while exercising outdoors. Ever tried running in a mask? I wouldn’t recommend it. Some teams resorted to training sessions via Zoom.\\nThis was a desperate time for Hong Kong sport, with elite athletes and emerging talent deprived of much-needed opportunities to develop.\\nIt was difficult to imagine the city would, even by 2025, be simultaneously hosting multiple sports events watched by tens of thousands of cheering fans, anticipating a haul of medals.\\nThat is why the National Games are important. They are a defining moment in Hong Kong’s post-pandemic recovery.\\nToday’s torch relay through the city’s streets and across the harbour to the new Kai Tak Stadium is a prelude to next Sunday’s opening ceremony in Guangzhou.\\nBut the action is already under way, with beach volleyball at Victoria Park and men’s handball in the Kai Tak Arena.\\nThe show, so far, has been stolen by Nicholas Halliday, who won Hong Kong’s first gold medal last week in a sailing event in Shanwei.\\nIt is, hopefully, the first of many as the city seeks to continue an unexpected winning streak that has helped transform perceptions of sport in Hong Kong and elevate its status.\\nThe government is pumping more money into the sector and an increasing number of elite international competitions are being hosted. Success, it is hoped, will breed success.\\nMomentum started to build shortly before the 2021 announcement that Hong Kong would host the National Games, along with Guangdong and Macau. The city’s performance in the Tokyo summer Olympics that year exceeded expectations.\\nSix medals were won, including a gold for fencer Cheung Ka-long, only the second ever secured by Hong Kong. The surprise success came as a welcome distraction from the pandemic deprivations and political changes of the time.\\nThe medal-winning feats also highlighted what should have been obvious long ago, that sport in the city has great potential – a healthy pursuit, a source of pride and togetherness, a means of improving Hong Kong’s international ties and boosting its economy. It should be a priority.\\nTokyo, it turned out, was just the start. Cheung struck gold again in the Paris Olympics last summer, as did fellow fencer Vivian Kong Man-wai. Swimmer Siobhan Haughey also did the city proud, winning two bronze.\\nHong Kong collected a record haul of medals in the Asian Games in 2023, in sports ranging from cycling to rowing, wushu, athletics and golf. The team returned with eight golds.\\nThere have been more recent achievements, too. Fencer Ryan Choi Chun-yin became the city’s first world champion in July. Tennis player Coleman Wong Chak-lam also made history, reaching the third round of the New York Open in September. And the city’s men’s rugby team have qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time.\\nIt is encouraging that Hong Kong’s young athletes are also performing well. They wrapped up the Asian Youth Games last week with 36 medals, another record, with swimmers leading the way.\\nBut to establish itself as a leading centre for sport – it was ranked 50 in the world this year – the city needs more than good performances. The ability to regularly host elite international events is essential.\\nThe opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March, with its 50,000-seat stadium, has been described as a game changer, making it much easier to attract top teams and tournaments.\\nA “football festival” featuring famous clubs from England and Italy drew big crowds there in July. Similar high-profile visits are in the pipeline.\\nSnooker, fencing, tennis, golf and table-tennis are among the sports that have chosen Hong Kong for major competitions. The days of pandemic-era isolation are long gone.\\nBut the National Games will pose unprecedented challenges. Hong Kong has wanted to be a co-host ever since returning to China in 1997, first expressing an interest in the 2001 event.\\nThe competition, between teams from across China, will be fierce. There are more than 400 events in 34 sports to be held at 11 Greater Bay Area cities until November 21.\\nHong Kong is hosting eight sports at seven venues. Highlights will include rugby sevens at Kai Tak Stadium, fencing at Kai Tak Arena, and track cycling at the Velodrome, as well as the cross-border marathon and road cycling races.\\nThe city hosted equestrian events for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the East Asian Games the following year. But the stakes are even higher for the National Games, considered a source of national pride.\\nMore than 4,000 athletes, officials and media representatives from the mainland need to be suitably accommodated and 100,000 tourists are expected. The city cannot afford anything other than a flawless execution.\\nHong Kong has not always embraced sport so enthusiastically. Parents tend to see academic success as more important and a sports culture has been slow to develop. This needs to change.\\nThe government appears to have woken up to the benefits sport can bring. Beijing, meanwhile, has identified the sector as a key driver of the economy, hoping to double the size of it by 2030.\\nDevelopments in Hong Kong include a much-needed shake-up of the sports associations, some of which operate like private clubs or fiefdoms. Moves intended to bring better corporate governance, inject younger blood and improve areas such as team selection have been put in place. They must be vigorously pursued.\\nHong Kong will need better coaching, training and facilities, as well as stronger support for its emerging and elite athletes if it is to build on what has already been achieved. The city has big ambitions. There is even talk of it bidding to co-host the Olympics along with other Greater Bay Area cities.\\nThe National Games will, if successful both in terms of hosting and performance, mark a significant step forward. But the transformation of the city’s sports scene is a marathon and the finishing line remains a long way away.\\n",
