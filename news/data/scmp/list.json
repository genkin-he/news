            "title": "China’s factory activity contracts for 7th month amid trade war uncertainty",
            "description": "China’s manufacturing activity remained in contraction for a seventh consecutive month in October, official data shows, as the world’s second-largest economy continues to battle persistent external headwinds and soft domestic demand.\\nThe manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) stood at 49 in October, down from 49.8 the previous month, according to data released on Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics.\\nThe reading fell short of the 50 projected by economists polled by financial data provider Wind.\\nThe monthly index compiles survey data given by supply chain managers from a variety of sectors. A reading above 50 suggests economic expansion, while one below 50 indicates contraction.\\n“Affected by factors such as the early release of some demand before the National Day holiday and a more complex international environment, manufacturing activity in October slowed down compared to the previous month,” said Huo Lihui, chief statistician of the bureau’s Service Survey Centre, noting that both demand and supply have slowed.\\nThe new orders sub-index – a measure of manufacturing demand – came in at 48.8 in October, down from 49.7 a month earlier. Meanwhile, the production sub-index dropped to 49.7 from 51.9 in September.\\nZhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, noted that China’s economic momentum has weakened since the middle of the year.\\n“The property sector slowdown continues to put pressure on domestic demand. The fiscal policy stance has not changed significantly to offset such downward pressure,” he said.\\n“As the trade negotiation went successfully yesterday, I think the macro policy in China will stay unchanged for the rest of this year. I expect fiscal policy will become more proactive in Q1 next year.”\\nChina’s vast manufacturing sector remains a vital source of growth for the country’s economy, and is set to maintain its central role in Beijing’s 15th five-year plan, which outlines the Chinese leadership’s policy priorities for the rest of the decade.\\nBut China’s factories have been weighed down this year by weak domestic demand, vicious price wars and a prolonged trade war with the United States – though output has remained more resilient than many observers predicted.\\nChina’s exports have so far held firm in the face of American tariffs, with front-loading and strong growth in shipments to alternative markets helping to offset a decline in demand from the US.\\nDomestic demand has remained soft despite government efforts to boost consumption, with the eight-day “golden week” public holiday in early October only bringing a modest year-on-year uptick in consumer spending.\\nHowever, there are signs that Beijing’s campaign against price wars and industrial overcapacity is starting to ease pressure on manufacturers. Industrial profits grew 21.6 per cent in September, the fastest pace in nearly two years, the statistics bureau said in a separate release on Monday.\\nAnd a meeting between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday set a tone of de-escalation between the world’s two largest economies.\\nThe US announced that it would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, while China’s Ministry of Commerce stated that its tightened export controls on rare earths would be suspended for one year.\\nChina’s non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, rose to 50.1 in October from 50 last month, the bureau’s data showed.\\nChina’s official composite PMI – which tracks both the manufacturing and services sectors – was 50 in October, compared with 50.6 in September.\\nAdditional reporting by Kandy Wong\\n",

            "description": "The decision by Hong Kong banks to follow the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut will help the city’s economy by easing loan repayments for mortgage holders, the finance chief has said, while revealing that local economic growth was doing “okay”.\\n“I welcome the rate cut, as it could lower the pressure on residents and businesspeople paying their mortgages,” Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po told the Post in an interview in Riyadh.\\nHe was referring to the recent move by Hong Kong’s major banks that saw them reduce their prime lending rates in some cases to a historic low of 5 per cent.\\nChan spoke ahead of Friday afternoon’s announcement of the city’s gross domestic product figures for the third quarter.\\nIn the interview, the finance chief said authorities had been observing the Federal Reserve, noting that Hong Kong’s interest rates should align with the American rate cuts due to the linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong and US currencies.\\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut the base rate to 4.25 per cent on Thursday morning, hours after the Federal Reserve pared its target rate by the same margin to a range of 3.75 to 4 per cent during the seventh meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this year.\\nChan added that the Federal Reserve’s rate cut provided the city with the conditions to lower the rate.\\nBut he cautioned that the scope for local rate cuts depended on the size of the city’s own capital pool.\\n\\nHe cited a past example of the US previously changing its interest rates, with Hong Kong having ample liquidity to follow on a smaller scale.\\nSpeaking on the overall economic situation ahead of the third-quarter data release, he said that the “GDP is okay”, citing a positive signal from the buoyant initial public offering market.\\nBut he conceded that Hong Kong was undergoing an economic transition and noted the catering and construction sectors were facing “relatively severe” challenges.\\n“We are highly cautious about the unemployment rate, since the city’s jobless rate has recently risen to 3.9 per cent between July and September,” he said.\\nHe said the situation would improve once the residential property market stabilised, adding that authorities were providing training courses for affected workers in the catering industry.\\nPreliminary data released by the Census and Statistics Department earlier this month showed Hong Kong’s jobless rate rose to 3.9 per cent between July and September, a rise of 0.2 percentage points from the preceding three-month period.\\nThe figure marks the highest rate since the three-month period between July and September 2022, when it was 4 per cent.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong could issue Islamic bonds to fund the Northern Metropolis megaproject as long as they are a cost-effective option, given the city’s established legal and regulatory framework for such activities under the faith, the finance chief has said.\\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po made the remarks on Thursday as he wrapped up his trip to this year’s Future Investment Initiative forum in Riyadh, where his trade delegation also yielded five memorandums of understanding (MOUs).\\n“The legal and regulatory framework for issuing Islamic bonds is mature. We can proceed at any time [for the Northern Metropolis], provided the market reflects that issuing these instruments is cheaper and yields better results,” he said in an interview with the Post in Riyadh.\\nChan said that the government would review funding options for the scheme, which aims to turn 30,000 hectares (74,132 acres) of land into an engine for economic growth and a housing hub, and would select the most cost-effective method while expediting development.\\nIn the annual budget announced in February last year, Chan said authorities planned to issue HK$95 billion (US$12.2 billion) to HK$135 billion in bonds annually over the next five years to drive the development of the Northern Metropolis and other infrastructure projects.\\nChan stressed on Thursday that Islamic finance was “always a component” of the government’s financial planning.\\nHe also said that, building on the momentum established at last year’s conference, five MOUs had been signed during the trip, with most involving technology firms and Hong Kong’s Trade Development Council (TDC).\\n\\nMaphive Technology CEO John Chan, who is part of the delegation team, expressed positivity about the trip, which culminated in the successful signing of an MOU with a subsidiary of Olayan Saudi Holding Company, part of the hospitality and events sector.\\n“I was able to meet investors during the trip and build up solid connections with some of them,” he said, adding that this was his third visit to Riyadh.\\nThe TDC signed an MOU with the Digital Cooperation Organisation, a multilateral body that focuses on the digital economy. The deal aims to foster collaboration in e-commerce, innovation and inclusive economic growth.\\nThe cooperation would support the participation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in TDC trade fairs and business-matching events, the Hong Kong body said.\\nPaul Chan also said Saudi companies showed great interest in utilising Hong Kong as a platform to access the wider Asian market during the meeting with enterprises from the country.\\n“Hong Kong could act as a two-way platform for both Saudi firms and Hong Kong and mainland companies [to interchange and collaborate],” he said.\\nHe further stated that authorities were actively building an ecosystem to suit both parties, pointing to Hong Kong’s launch of Asia’s first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking Saudi Arabia’s Islamic government bonds earlier this year.\\nFollowing the ETF launch, market anticipation is high for the first firm from the Middle East to list in Hong Kong.\\nChan noted that the first company could be listed in a few months, citing Dubai-based diaper maker Softcare, which began assessing investor interest in its Hong Kong initial public offering after passing its listing hearing in late October.\\n“I expect that gradually we will see companies from Saudi Arabia come to Hong Kong to list, as the kingdom has a vast number of projects that require capital,” he said.\\nUnder the kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan, Saudi Arabia is aggressively modernising and diversifying its economy to reduce its reliance on oil.\\nSpeaking of forming close ties between Hong Kong and Gulf states, Chan said the authorities were actively progressing with plans to establish an Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Riyadh, with “significant progress expected in the next few months”.\\nThe government currently operates one ETO in the Middle East, located in Dubai.\\n",

            "title": "Indonesia still ‘considering’ buying Chinese J-10 fighter jets to modernise its military",
            "description": "Indonesia is still “considering” acquiring Chinese J-10 fighter jets, but no decision has been made yet, according to Jakarta’s Ministry of Defence, clarifying earlier reports that the country was set to buy up to 42 units to modernise its military.\\n“It’s still being analysed and reviewed. At the moment, we are considering all platforms that can fulfil our need to help guard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” ministry spokesman Brigadier General Frega Wenas Inkiriwang said.\\nOn October 16, local and newswire agencies quoted Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin as saying the J-10 “will be flying in Jakarta shortly” but gave no details.\\nThe following week, Sjamsoeddin said Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, would be the one to decide whether to buy the J-10s, according to local news outlet Tempo. Prabowo has not made a decision.\\nObservers say the J-10s would be cheaper than other fighters on the market but adding them to the Indonesian Air Force would complicate operations within its own military and with the armed forces of other countries.\\n\\nFirst developed by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation in the 1980s as China’s third-generation fighter jet, the J-10 series has in recent years been upgraded to the 4.5-generation J-10C and become one of Beijing’s major defence industry products.\\nDubbed the “Vigorous Dragon”, the fourth-generation fighter is equipped with active electronically scanned array radar and advanced air-to-air missiles like the PL-15.\\nIf Indonesia did go ahead and buy the aircraft, it would be China’s first sale of military hardware to the Southeast Asian giant.\\nIndonesia has 110 fighter planes in total, including American F-16s, Russian Su-27s and Su-30s, plus British BAE Hawk 100 and 200 series aircraft. Indonesia also ordered 42 French Rafales for US$8.1 billion in 2022, with the first six due for delivery next year.\\nIn addition, Jakarta has signed a contract to buy 48 Kaan fighter jets from Turkey and is scheduled to receive two new T-50i fighter jets from South Korea in November as part of a procurement deal for six T-50i Golden Eagle jets.\\nBut, for now, it has just 62 operational fighters in its ranks. Spare parts for Russian-made Sukhoi Su-27s and Su-30s have become scarce and US-made F-16s are showing their age, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a Canberra-based think tank.\\nASPI said the J-10 piqued Indonesian officials’ interest after Pakistan’s J-10s reportedly outperformed India’s French-made Rafale fighter jets during a clash in May.\\nHowever, Muhammad Fauzan Malufti, an Indonesian defence analyst, said Indonesian officials had not cited the India-Pakistan air skirmish as a factor. “Even if it played a role, I don’t think it is the main factor behind the decision,” Malufti said.\\nMalufti said the possible J-10 procurement served as a “political signal of neutrality and non-alignment” from Indonesia.\\n\\n\\nIan Storey, a senior fellow at the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said price was a major consideration for the Indonesian military.\\n“Cost is one important factor, as the J-10 is less than half the price of its Western analogues, America’s F-16 and France’s Rafale,” Storey said, adding that Indonesia “does not want to depend” on any single country for its military equipment.\\nDuring the 1990s, the administration of then US president Bill Clinton imposed sanctions on Indonesia’s armed forces, citing human rights abuses in East Timor. As a result, the Indonesian Air Force’s American-made planes were grounded for lack of spare parts.\\nIn addition, the Prabowo administration has sought to “pursue a balanced foreign policy between East and West”, Storey said.\\nBuying the Chinese jets would reflect that policy and increase the number of countries from whom Indonesia sourced aircraft, but it would also complicate interoperability within its existing fleet and during military exercises with other countries.\\nStorey said it would be “a very challenging task for the Indonesian Air Force to integrate the encrypted communication, sensor networks and datalinks of Western, Russian and Chinese aircraft”.\\n“The air force will have to maintain separate and costly training, maintenance and logistical streams for all these different warplanes,” he added.\\nStorey also said the J-10’s electronic, sensor and communication systems were incompatible with Western-made aircraft. He said Indonesia would try to integrate the different systems but achieving full interoperability would be technically complex and very expensive.\\n“At best, Indonesia may only achieve partial interoperability, and that will be suboptimal in combat situations,” Storey said.\\n\\nMalufti agreed, saying the various aircraft from different countries would mean different spare parts, software, manuals, weapons, training and supply chains.\\n“[This would] force the Indonesian Air Force to buy unique tools, weapons and spare parts as well as create different training programmes for each aircraft, resulting in higher maintenance and training costs,” he said.\\nThe addition of Chinese fighter jets to Indonesia’s fleet would carry implications for its joint military exercises with Western countries.\\nStorey said the US “won’t allow its own fighter jets to exercise with Indonesia’s Russian-made and Chinese-made aircraft”.\\nThis prospect could complicate Indonesia’s flagship joint military exercise, Super Garuda Shield, held annually since 2007 in collaboration with the US and 11 other countries including Singapore, Germany, Australia, France and Britain.\\nThis year’s exercise involved more than 6,000 troops and was designed to boost interoperability and strengthen collective readiness among the participating armed forces.\\nFor China, a J-10 sale would mark a breakthrough in its defence diplomacy in Southeast Asia. Indonesia would become the first Association of Southeast Asian Nations member state to acquire a wholly Chinese-made modern, multirole fighter jet, according to Storey. At present, Myanmar operates JF-17s – fighter jets jointly developed by China and Pakistan – and the Chinese FTC-2000, a light training jet.\\nBut even if Indonesia did invest in the Chinese military hardware, “very few other regional states are likely to follow suit”, Storey said.\\nHe said Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia would be holdouts “because they are rival claimants with China in the South China Sea”. Singapore would “stick with US-made fighters” and Thailand was “unlikely to buy Chinese fighter jets either, preferring Western aircraft”.\\n“Myanmar might, if China is prepared to extend a generous loan,” Storey said.\\nIf it went ahead, it would “mark a significant milestone in Jakarta-Beijing defence cooperation”, Malufti said. “China would definitely use the deal to showcase the J-10 as a credible alternative to Western fighters.”\\n",

            "title": "Developer China Vanke reports US$2.3 billion loss amid sales slowdown",
            "description": "Developer China Vanke reported a deeper third-quarter loss, highlighting mounting challenges as the prolonged property market downturn continues to weigh on its sales.\\nThe Shenzhen-based company posted a loss of 16.1 billion yuan (US$2.3 billion) in the three months ended September 30, roughly doubling its loss from a year earlier. That brings its combined losses for the first nine months of the year to 28 billion yuan, according to a statement to the Shenzhen exchange on Thursday.\\nPersistent weakness in China’s housing market is creating pressure on the developer’s bottom line, despite increased financial support from its largest state-owned shareholder, Shenzhen Metro Group. The company’s financial position remains vulnerable as it deals with a wall of onshore debt maturities.\\nThe country’s home sales deteriorated further in July, and new-home prices fell at an accelerated pace. The price slump is deterring homebuyers who are increasingly concerned about the viability of buying real estate as a store of wealth.\\nThe developer’s gross contracted sales will likely further decline over the next six to 12 months, Moody’s Ratings said in a note earlier this month.\\nVanke was once China’s largest developer but has become the latest flashpoint in the nation’s prolonged property crisis, underscoring the severity of the sector’s challenges.\\nThe country’s new home sales by area may decline about 15 per cent from their current level before the sector stabilises, Fitch Ratings analyst Lulu Shi said earlier this week.\\nThe builder still has 10.8 billion yuan of onshore debt maturing by the end of this year. Its biggest maturity wall will be next year, when about 24 billion yuan of onshore public bonds and loans come due.\\n\\n“Vanke could face a more than 100 billion yuan drop in sales proceeds, which would worsen its funding gap and raise the costs of a government rescue,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kristy Hung said in a note last week.\\nSeparately, Vanke said earlier in October that recently appointed Chairman Xin Jie resigned and that Huang Liping, general manager of Shenzhen Metro, would take over the role. Huang has served as a board member at Vanke since 2021.\\nInvestors grew concerned about future state support after the sudden resignation, leading to a mild decline in one of its dollar notes.\\nStill, Vanke said in the earnings release that Shenzhen Metro intended to provide another loan not exceeding 2.2 billion yuan. The funds are earmarked to help Vanke repay principal and interest on publicly issued bonds, the same purpose as the loans the shareholder provided earlier this year.\\nThe developer has secured sufficient funds to redeem a 2.5 billion yuan bond ahead of its maturity, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, a move that may help soothe market worries.\\n",

            "title": "How Hong Kong can capitalise on Trump’s attacks on US universities",
            "description": "Few moments in US history have tested academic freedom as much as the present, with US President Donald Trump’s administration releasing a 10-point Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. What started as bureaucratic proposals have hardened into a national doctrine tying federal funding to political conformity. It is changing the nature of US universities and reshaping international education options.\\nThe plan, initially sent to nine universities, proposed conformity with certain demands in return for securing preferential access to federal funds. They include removing race and gender factors from admissions and hiring, publishing detailed student applicant data, reinstating standardised testing, freezing tuition fees for five years and limiting the international undergraduate enrolment to 15 per cent.\\nUniversities with endowments exceeding US$2 million per student must offer free tuition for science degrees. Diversity and inclusion programmes are to be replaced by a “marketplace of ideas”. Institutions that sign the compact gain better access to federal research funding; those that refuse risk investigation or frozen grants.\\nThe backlash has been considerable. Most universities approached, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brown, have rejected the agreement, viewing it as an attack on academic independence.\\nPublic opinion reflects these concerns. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed most Americans view the plan as government overreach. While some support measures to reduce costs in higher education, many feel uncomfortable with Washington’s growing control over campus affairs. This discomfort has sparked widespread opposition and protests across the country. Although higher education needs reform, many believe political enforcement is the wrong method.\\nFor international students, the plan comes amid a wave of restrictions. The Department of Homeland Security wants to replace the flexible “duration of status” visa rule with fixed terms of no more than four years, requiring renewals for longer courses. Applicants now face extended background and social media checks, new fees and mandatory reporting by universities. Visa caps targeting certain nationalities, especially Chinese students in science and technology fields, have fuelled uncertainty.\\n\\n\\nThis uncertainty is especially evident in India, where generations of students have aspired to study in the United States. That ambition is being disrupted, with a reported 45 per cent decline in Indian student arrivals. Academic pathways that once represented opportunity are now fraught with bureaucratic barriers, undermining the essence of US higher education and its ability to attract global talent, reducing its influence on the world stage.\\nMeanwhile other places are relaxing their admission policies. Hong Kong raised the limit on non-local undergraduates in publicly funded programmes to 40 per cent in 2024, and this year’s policy address proposes raising it to 50 per cent next year, signalling the city’s ambition. Universities are working to expand scholarships, research collaborations and partnerships. They offer a blend of East-West access and academic independence that appeals to students and academics seeking opportunity and openness.\\nBut challenges remain. While Hong Kong’s policies are evolving to attract international students, their integration into local communities and university life still lags behind. Many mainland and non-local students struggle to form meaningful connections with local peers.\\nUniversities need to go beyond academic achievement and foster the soft skills that enrich students’ experiences and prepare them to succeed in a multicultural world. These skills are vital not only for academic or professional success but also to promote cultural exchange and build genuine connections.\\nBuilding these connections is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, respect and a sense of community. As a student in the US, I formed lifelong friendships with peers from around the world, gained deep cultural insights and learned to navigate differences – experiences that enriched my education.\\n\\nFor Hong Kong to become a global education hub, it must cultivate integration, welcoming students from all parts of the world and creating connections that inspire collaboration and innovation.\\nThis is not new for Hong Kong. In the 1960s and 1970s, many Southeast Asian youth of Chinese descent came here for education because their parents wanted them to learn Chinese and options at home were limited. When these students returned home, they became valuable business connections, carrying fond memories of Hong Kong’s people, food and culture. Trust, built through shared experience, laid the groundwork for future business.\\nThis highlights the importance of Hong Kong leveraging its role as an international education hub to cultivate lasting connections. International students, including from the mainland, should leave with more than an education; they should carry meaningful relationships with local and international peers. Relationships formed at university can foster trust, collaboration and long-term success.\\n",
