            "title": "Trump hails ‘lasting’ deal with Xi, dangles more possible tariff cuts",
            "description": "Just back from his whirlwind Asia tour, US President Donald Trump on Friday hailed a newly negotiated trade deal with China as a “long-lasting” victory even as he teased the possibility of more tariff concessions.\\nAboard Air Force One en route to his Palm Beach, Florida, resort, Trump painted the Busan, South Korea, summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday as a blockbuster for US agriculture, especially soybeans, and dangled the prospect of stronger trade ties.\\n“The deal with China is going to be wonderful. It’s going to be long lasting,” Trump said, crediting his personal rapport with Xi for the success. “I got along with President Xi very well … The meeting with China was incredible.”\\nDespite Trump’s chest-thumping, analysts said there are serious questions about the agreement that leave ample room for misunderstanding, misinterpretation and a slide into another downward spiral and do not address some of the most significant irritants in the US-China relationship.\\n“The rivalry’s structural fault lines remain intact,” said Han Lin, Shanghai-based China managing director with the Asia Group. “Unsurprisingly, both leaders are playing to their bases, not building lasting peace.”\\n\\n\\nThursday’s pact, building on a framework announced earlier in the week, averts a threatened escalation in the trade war and secures a pledge by China to buy at least 25 million tons (25.4 million metric tonnes) of US soybeans annually for the next three years, along with sorghum and other farm products.\\nTrump has boasted that the deals made in Asia are bringing in “over US$3 trillion really, in profit”, telling farmers to “go out and buy larger tractors and more land” in anticipation of the windfall.\\nAfter reaching a 15-month high on trade-deal optimism a day earlier, soybean futures slipped Wednesday as US farmers took profits from the previous session’s rally.\\nThe agreement also tackles Beijing’s rare earth export curbs, crucial for US tech and defence. China has agreed to pause these restrictions for a year, with Trump hinting on Thursday that the truce could be “very routinely extended”.\\nIn return, the US cut fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese imports from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, framing it as an incentive for Beijing to curb illicit opioid production.\\n“I’ve given China great incentives to hold down the fentanyl, get rid of it,” Trump said on Friday, noting its medical uses while blasting its illicit trade.\\n“I really believe that they have an incentive,” he added. “I’d love to get rid of the extra 10 per cent.”\\nThe president’s apparent willingness to make more concessions, at least for now, marks a pivot from his tariff-heavy strategy.\\nTrump insisted the deal’s strength lies in the personal rapport between top leaders – and his own intelligence.\\n\\n“I think for a long period of time, we have a smart president. We have a great relationship. If we don’t have a smart president – which is also a very strong possibility – then we won’t have a great relationship,” he said.\\nBut analysts outlined several areas of potential concern about the US-China deal, including the lack of any detailed written account of its terms.\\nWhile China has pledged to “work very hard” at stemming the flow of fentanyl ingredients, in Trump’s words, no specifics have been disclosed involving what China might do beyond what it has already.\\nThis is hugely consequential given that Beijing’s evident pledge on fentanyl is the basis for a 10 percentage point reduction in overall US tariffs on Chinese goods – to 47 per cent from 57 per cent.\\nThe deal also suspended US tariffs on Chinese imports set to hit November 1 for rare earth minerals and November 10 for “reciprocal” tariffs. Unclear, however, is how long the pause will last, whether it extends for 90 days as Trump has done repeatedly in the past, or has a longer tenure.\\nThe two sides also appeared to have a different take on what was agreed to regarding China’s rare earth export restrictions, essential for US hi-tech manufacturing of everything from food processors to military jets.\\n“Both sides are seeking to reduce their dependence on the other, and extend the other party’s dependence,” said Michael Hirson, practice head at 22V Research and a former financial attaché with the US embassy in Beijing. “This tussle is particularly intense in rare earths and semiconductors.”\\nWhile Trump said the “rare earth issue has been settled”, Beijing has focused on the pause’s one-year time frame, highlighting the continued leverage it holds over the US.\\n“It’s welcome news that Beijing agreed to hold off implementing its recently announced sweeping rare earth export restrictions, but we should expect Beijing to use this threat as a hammer over the US’ head,” said Wendy Cutler, senior vice-president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\\n“Trump has met his match with China, which has shown that two can play at this game,” added the former deputy US trade negotiator.\\nIndeed, both sides have kept their trade ammunition handy, underscoring the lack of trust and the highly delicate nature of the truce.\\nTrump could quickly raise tariffs again if he believes China is not complying with the terms of Thursday’s deal. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said hours after the agreement was announced that a Section 301 investigation into China’s compliance – with provisions for additional tariffs – remains in place.\\n\\nSomewhat surprising, some analysts said, was the lack of a deal in South Korea on an “ownership transfer” of the short video platform TikTok, which had been teed up as a likely deliverable, indicating there may be more problems hammering out terms than suggested.\\nElsewhere, Trump wrote on social media that China committed to buying energy products. Yet this was not mentioned in the Chinese readouts.\\nAlso unclear was whether Trump promised Beijing it would ease export restrictions on high-end US semiconductors, a move that many in US national security circles believe would cede a key US technological advantage to America’s primary rival.\\n“His potential willingness to allow Nvidia to sell the B30A – a chip designed for China’s market and substantially more advanced than the H20 chip that Beijing has disdained – aroused a sharp reaction … in US policy circles, especially among China hawks,” Hirson said.\\n",

            "title": "Cuts to US ‘fentanyl tariffs’ help Chinese exporters close the gap on competition",
            "description": "With the US cutting its tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 per cent – halving a duty initially imposed by Washington over allegations of complicity in the fentanyl trade – analysts said the reduction may further strengthen the competitiveness of Chinese exporters, particularly in mass-produced goods.\\nFollowing a meeting on Thursday between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in South Korea, the world’s two largest economies reached a consensus on the issue, with the US agreeing to remove half of its 20 per cent in fentanyl-related tariffs on China, effective immediately.\\nThe 90-day pause on tariff increases the two sides agreed to during trade talks in May, extended by another 90 days in August, was also lengthened after this week’s meeting, this time for one year.\\nThat brings overall US tariffs on Chinese goods to 47 per cent, down from the previous 57 per cent, Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the summit. Those figures include duties imposed before Trump’s second term.\\n“The 10 per cent tariff cut on top of generally higher tariffs on the rest of the world should help improve exporters’ competitiveness to varying extents moving forward,” said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist with Dutch financial services firm ING.\\n“Generally, China has the world’s most complete manufacturing infrastructure and benefits from economies of scale, allowing it to outcompete many other nations.”\\nDexter Roberts, a US-based senior fellow at the Global China Hub under the Atlantic Council think tank, said that Chinese exporters are already “hyper-competitive” compared with their Asian counterparts, due to the intensity of the domestic market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, with the US tariff cut, that advantage will become more evident, particularly for lower-margin products, Roberts said.\\n“Doing this on razor-thin margins is something often other countries find it hard to compete on,” he said.\\n“If they’re selling at a 10 per cent cost advantage, as soon as the fee is taken away, suddenly China becomes competitive again. For the traditional lower-value goods, the margins were extremely low,” Roberts said. “If you’re selling shoes or toys, 10 per cent is huge.”\\nThe additional duties the US imposed on China this year have been reduced to 20 per cent following the cut, narrowing or eliminating the tariff gap between China and other manufacturing hubs in Asia, including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan.\\nVietnam is currently subject to US tariffs of 20 per cent – which could be raised by an additional 40 per cent if it is found to be facilitating transshipments from China – while South Korea and Japan are each subject to 15 per cent import duties.\\nRenewed trade tensions between the US and China this year have prompted discussions among manufacturers about relocating parts of their production to Southeast Asia to mitigate the impact of trade barriers.\\nBut as the tariff landscape has changed, analysts said investors may reconsider their manufacturing arrangements, which could in turn bolster China’s exports.\\n“The commitment to postpone the pending reciprocal tariffs by one year should help improve market sentiment thanks to reduced near-term uncertainties, allowing corporates to recalibrate investment decisions and supply chain adjustments,” said Zhang Ning, senior China economist at UBS, in a research note on Friday.\\nZhang added that the tariff cut is “modestly positive for China’s export growth and global supply chain”.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, HSBC said in a Thursday research note that, if US tariffs are kept at current levels, this could help restore business confidence and investment.\\nThe bank estimated that China’s gross domestic product growth could be boosted by as much as 0.3 percentage points from the US tariff cut.\\nAs the world’s largest economy, the US remains China’s top single-country export destination, with an outbound shipment value of US$524.7 billion in 2024 according to Chinese customs data. This is more than three times the figure for Vietnam, the second-highest ranked country by export value.\\nHowever, Chinese exporters have been reducing their reliance on the US this year. In the first nine months of 2025, China’s exports to the US declined by 16.9 per cent year on year.\\n“The 10-percentage-point reduction is expected to have a significant positive impact on Chinese exporters and play an important role in stabilising exports to the US,” said Cui Fan, a professor of international trade at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics, in an article posted to social media on Thursday.\\nIn his piece, Cui argued cumulative US tariffs on China now stand at around 41 per cent, rather than the 47 per cent cited by the Trump administration.\\nHe based this rate on a broad average that includes the tariffs invoked under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, as well as sector-specific tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\\n",

            "description": "The latest addition to the cast of Paramount+ hit show Tulsa King, Bella Heathcote may be a familiar face to horror fans. The Australian actress, who plays Cleo Montague in the crime drama, made her big-screen debut in the 2008 horror film Acolytes and was in Tim Burton’s 2012 horror-comedy Dark Shadows and Netflix’s 2022 horror miniseries Pieces of Her alongside Toni Collette.\\n\\nThe mob drama – created by Taylor Sheridan, whose impressive résumé includes Yellowstone and Landman – follows Sylvester Stallone as Dwight “The General” Manfredi as he sets up his own empire in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after being exiled there by his mafia boss.\\nSince Cleo entered the scene, fans have seen a new side of her old flame, Manfredi’s trusted lieutenant Mitch Keller (Garrett Hedlund).\\n\\nHere’s everything you need to know about Bella Heathcote.\\nShe began acting after her mother died\\n\\nBorn in May 1987 in Melbourne, Isabella Heathcote started taking performance classes when she was 12 at her school, Korowa Anglican Girls’ School. Her mother had died and her father, a lawyer, thought they would keep her distracted.\\nHeathcote fell in love with singing, dancing and drama, but she hesitated at first at the idea of pursuing acting as a career. It was a nudge from her father that convinced her to study drama at university.\\n“By the time I got through my first year, I realised I could only pursue acting because everything else just made me miserable,” the actress told the Herald Sun in a 2016 interview.\\nShe has a varied résumé\\n\\nFollowing her film debut in Acolytes, Heathcote starred in the long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours. She played a Berlin-born filmmaker – even leveraging her schoolgirl German and working with a dialect coach – in the Amazon Prime Video dystopian alternate-history TV series The Man in the High Castle, based on the 1962 novel by Philip K. Dick. In 2017 she portrayed Christian Grey’s mentally ill and potentially dangerous ex-girlfriend Leila in Fifty Shades Darker, the second film in the Fifty Shades franchise starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.\\nShe collects skulls\\n\\nDuring a 2012 interview with Vogue Australia, when asked about boyfriend-worthy gift recommendations, the 38-year-old revealed that she collects skulls, adding, “I think that a beautiful skull is a really good gift for a guy”.\\nIs Bella Heathcote single?\\n\\nBad news for those crushing on the actress: Heathcote is married to architect Richard Stampton. The pair wed in 2019, according to her IMDB profile. Before Stampton, Heathcote was engaged to filmmaker Andrew Dominik, 20 years her senior. The two dated for seven years before the internet spotted Heathcote on Instagram, wearing a diamond on her ring finger to Lily Collins’ birthday party. The couple split up soon after.\\n",

            "title": "I put myself on the Shanghai marriage market. It wasn’t pretty",
            "description": "In a previous column, I outed my pre-pandemic dating life as a middle-aged newly single Chinese woman in the United Kingdom.\\nSix months into my spreadsheet approach to love (100 daily Tinder swipes, 50 culls and a literacy-and-basic-human-decency filter), however, I decamped to China – on sabbatical, to research xiaolongbao, and for the anthropological thrill of being a shengnu (leftover woman) on home turf (sort of).\\nChina greeted me with a shrug. On Tinder and Baihe in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai, a 40-something woman doing dozens of free swipes a day netted two to three matches a week. Hong Kong said hello, then ghosted. Shenzhen tried to sell me a pyramid scheme involving hair transplants and bee pollen for men and women of all ages.\\nShanghai, though, came with a wingwoman. G, a no-nonsense East German at the conservatory where I was on research leave, pushed me into Friday tango lessons on the ninth floor of an inner-city office building that had sprung parquet flooring and was all very earnestly renovated. The Shanghainese instructor, a severe taskmistress with a bloodhound’s nose for fakes, clocked my synthetic felt-bottomed heels (I swear I was conducting fieldwork for a dance anthropology project). Everyone else refused to swap partners. I left with a sprained ankle and a compendium of stern glares.\\nSo, on to the infamous weekend marriage market at People’s Square. G, a formidable matriarch fluent in love, duty and European bakeries in Shanghai, encouraged me with a mock-imperial flourish: “Go forth in the name of anthropology, discover and conquer.”\\nThe park is a prehistoric but ruthlessly efficient analogue of Tinder, run by parents with umbrellas. Elderly Chinese mothers and fathers tape their children’s vital stats to rain gear: gender, age, height, salary, square footage of the apartment already secured in a first-tier city, in that order.\\n\\nThe market has zones and sub-zones: by decade (1970s, 1980s, 1990s), by religion (there’s a Muslim area), by education level and province. To G’s delight, there’s also a special corner for divorced men stationed overseas, including London. “Now,” G instructed, “this is your moment. You will introduce yourself to these nice parents.”\\nAnd so I did.\\nMy first mistake was to have arrived without a marriage broker. A kindly couple in their 70s waved their son’s résumé at me – sadly, no photo for quality control – and apologised for his wretched divorced status. “They broke up because she was a shinu,” a stone woman who couldn’t have children, the mother explained, lowering her voice. “And whom might you be representing?”\\n“Er…myself.”\\nSilence. Full-body scan of my dumpling-filled and dumpling-shaped physique. “When were you born? 1980s? 1970s?”\\nMore silence. Then a sympathetic cough and a pat on the shoulder. “I’m afraid you’re a little too old. Such a waste, you do have qualifications. Since you also live in the West and are obviously Western-minded, attending this day by yourself.”\\n\\nWhat? No. I was chaperoned by my wingwoman, clearly. The mother mistook my puzzlement for heartbreak and added helpfully: “Maybe you can adopt?”\\nG began to huff, affronted and protective. As if on cue, this summoned an affable actual marriage broker who had been eavesdropping. He shrugged at my plight, then brightened at G. “Your friend, the blonde, if she’s up for it, I know a guy…not quite marriageable, but definitely interested …”\\nCue evil eye and baring of teeth. We retreated to the nearest scallion pancake stall for emergency – no, incensed – consumption. That marked the end of my Shanghai dating career.\\nWhat did I learn from representing myself in a public park in a country that is both ancestral land and study site?\\nThat pre-pandemic China could be brutally ageist, patriarchal and progeny-obsessed. That the parent-run market, for all its quaintness, is more efficient than modern apps: criteria stack neatly, expectations are blatant, and romance is an optional add-on you might install later, like an artificial intelligence-powered grammar check.\\nI learned something about my own limits. I was playing scientist with my love life: swipes, filters, variables. More data equals more dates equals more happiness, no?\\n\\nBack in London, this method reaped some results. In Shanghai, the model broke on cultural rock. Without a broker, without a photo, without the correct birth decade, without the right guanxi, I wasn’t just the wrong candidate; I was a category error.\\nFriends have since reported better weather. Post-pandemic, a few Chinese aunties I know navigated new-generation apps like Tantan, dodging love scams and finding their dream uncles. The landscape shifts; the code updates.\\nBut the auntie I was in pre-pandemic Shanghai decided to quit the lab. I would focus on myself. I would do morning yoga via internet tutorials (this yielded a slipped disc and a dislocated meniscus). I would eat fewer dumplings (I ate those dumplings). I would lose 7kg (I gained 10). I would climb Huangshan in Anhui without a cable car (I went to a panda reserve in Sichuan instead and made faces at those inconveniently cute creatures).\\nI waited out my time in East Asia, between Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I pressed pause on the spreadsheets. And then I returned to London to restart the experiment with a mixture of caution and mischief.\\n",

I like him a lot, but you know, what they did was wrong. He was very nice. He apologised for what they did with the commercial.”\\nEconomic data released by Statistics Canada on Friday showed the trade battle is taking a toll on the economy, with the numbers pointing to just 0.4 per cent annualised growth in the third quarter.\\nEarlier on Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the goal is for the US and Canada to return to the table after talks broke off last week, and for the countries to cooperate more closely on oil, gas and critical minerals.\\nThere has been friction in the talks between Canada and the US “for some good reasons”, Wright told reporters at the Group of Seven energy and environment ministers’ meeting in Toronto on Friday.\\n\\nTrump called off the negotiations last week after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that drew from a 1987 radio address by former US president Ronald Reagan. Trump also threatened an additional 10 per cent tariff on Canada.\\nBefore the breakdown, Carney said the two countries had been progressing on a deal on steel and aluminium sectoral tariffs, as well as energy. Carney had pitched Trump on reviving the Keystone XL pipeline project.\\n“Unfortunately we’ve had some bumps on the road,” Wright said.\\n“I would say the goal is to bring those back together and I think to see cooperation between the United States and Canada across critical minerals, across oil and gas.”\\nTrump has also said recently that he was satisfied with the current trade arrangement between the US and Canada, which includes US import taxes on cars, timber, steel and aluminium, along with a 35 per cent tariff on other goods not shipped under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump signed during his first term.\\n",

            "title": "US judges order Trump administration to continue Snap food aid despite shutdown",
            "description": "Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that US President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund Snap, the nation’s biggest food aid programme, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\\nThe rulings came a day before the US Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\\nThe programme serves about one in every eight Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net.\\nWord in October that it would be a November 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and Snap recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the programme going.\\nThe programme costs around US$8 billion per month nationally.\\n\\nDemocratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the programme, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.\\nThe administration said it was not allowed to use a contingency fund with about US$5 billion in it for the programme, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep Snap running.\\nThe Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, it must be. They also said a separate fund with around US$23 billion was available for the cause.\\nA federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from a bench that the programme must be funded using at least the contingency funds – and asked for an update on progress by Monday.\\nA Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds\\nIt was not immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.\\nThe rulings are likely to face appeals.\\nIn a hearing in Boston on Thursday on a legal challenge filed by the Democratic officials from 25 states, one federal judge seemed sceptical of the administration’s argument that Snap benefits could be halted.\\n\\nUS District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government could not afford to cover the cost, there was a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. “The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,” said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by former US president Barack Obama.\\nTalwani seemed to be leaning towards requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds towards Snap. That, she said, was her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency’s funding runs out.\\n“If you don’t have money, you tighten your belt,” she said in court. “You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game someplace.”\\nGovernment lawyers say a contingency fund containing some US$5 billion cannot legally be used to maintain Snap, a programme that costs about US$8 billion a month. The states say it must be used for that purpose and point to more money available in a second federal account with around US$23 billion.\\nTalwani said her ruling would apply nationwide, not just in the states that are part of the challenge. That could defy the intentions of the US Supreme Court, which has limited the use of nationwide injunctions, though it has not prohibited them.\\nMeanwhile, states, food banks and recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries.\\nMost states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the debit cards used in the programme.\\nAdvocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.\\n\\nAt a Washington news conference on Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs Snap, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of Snap for long.\\nSpeaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a “disgusting dereliction of duty” by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of healthcare funds.\\nA push this week to continue Snap funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.\\nTo qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four’s net income after certain expenses cannot exceed the federal poverty line, which is about US$31,000 per year.\\nLast year, Snap provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children, according to the lawsuit.\\n",

            "description": "Tanzania’s main opposition said hundreds had been killed in three days of election protests, with the country still under an internet blackout on Friday and the government denying any use of “excessive force”.\\nA security source and diplomat in Dar es Salaam both said that deaths were “in the hundreds” as protests continued on Friday.\\nPresident Samia Suluhu Hassan had sought to cement her position and silence critics in her party with an emphatic win in Wednesday’s election, in which her main challengers were either jailed or barred from standing.\\nBut the vote descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets of Dar es Salaam and other cities, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew.\\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said his government had “no figures” on any dead.\\n“Currently no excessive force has been used,” he said in an interview with Al-Jazeera. “There’s no number until now of any protesters killed.”\\n\\nBut the main opposition party, Chadema, said casualties were very high.\\n“As we speak the figure for deaths in Dar [es Salaam] is around 350 and for Mwanza it is 200-plus. Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,” Chadema spokesman John Kitoka said.\\n“The death toll could be much higher,” he warned, saying killings could be happening during the nighttime curfew.\\nThe security source said they were hearing reports of more than 500 dead, “maybe 700-800 in the whole country”.\\nWith foreign journalists largely banned from covering the election and a communications blackout entering its third day, information from the ground has been scarce.\\nThe first toll from an international body came early Friday when the United Nations said it had “credible reports” of 10 dead, while Amnesty International said it had information of at least 100 killed.\\nMultiple hospitals and health clinics were too afraid to talk directly to Agence France-Presse.\\nHassan had yet to comment on the unrest and local news sites have not been updated since Wednesday.\\nArmy chief Jacob Mkunda late Thursday called the protesters “criminals”.\\n\\nIn Zanzibar, a tourist hotspot with its own semi-autonomous government, Hassan’s Revolution Party (Chama Cha Mapinduzi: CCM) had already been declared winner of the local vote on Thursday.\\nThe opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, rejected the result, saying: “They have robbed the people of Zanzibar of their voice … The only solution to deliver justice is through a fresh election.”\\nA senior party official said that ballot boxes had been stuffed, people allowed to vote multiple times without ID and their election observers kicked out of counting rooms.\\nAt a meeting place for opposition supporters on Zanzibar, there was dismay and fear.\\n“There has never been a credible election since 1995,” said a 70-year-old man, referring to Tanzania’s first multiparty vote.\\nNone of those interviewed gave their names.\\n“We are afraid of speaking because they might come to our houses and pick us up,” said one.\\n\\nHassan has faced opposition from parts of the army and allies of her iron-fisted predecessor, John Magufuli, since she took over upon his death in 2021, analysts say.\\nThey said she wanted an emphatic victory to cement her position, and the authorities banned the main opposition party, Chadema, and put its leader on trial for treason.\\nIn the run-up to the vote, rights groups condemned a “wave of terror” in the east African nation, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.\\nMuch public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the crackdown.\\nACT-Wazalendo was allowed to contest the local election in Zanzibar, but its candidate was barred from competing against Hassan on the mainland.\\n",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump on Friday denied he was considering strikes inside Venezuela, appearing to contradict his own comments from last week and amid intensifying expectations that Washington may soon expand drug-trafficking-related operations.\\nThe US has built up a large military presence in the Caribbean in recent months, with fighter aircraft, warships and thousands of troops. That presence will significantly expand in the coming weeks with the arrival of the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier strike group.\\nOn Friday, when asked by reporters on Air Force One if media reports that he was considering strikes within Venezuela were true, Trump said: “No.”\\nIt was not immediately clear if Trump was ruling out future strikes inside Venezuela or simply saying no final decision had been made yet.\\nIn recent weeks, Trump has publicly said that his administration will carry out strikes against drug-related targets inside Venezuela. “The land is going to be next,” Trump told reporters last week.\\n\\nThe US campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific has already targeted at least 14 boats that Washington said were involved in the illegal drug trade, killing 61 people.\\nWhile the exact timing of any land strikes is unclear, officials close to Trump had suggested it could be soon.\\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican lawmaker, said on Sunday that Trump had told him the administration planned to brief lawmakers on military operations against Venezuela and Colombia when he returned from his trip to Asia.\\nTrump returned to Washington on Thursday.\\nA US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the military had provided a range of options, including strikes against military facilities inside Venezuela, such as runways. That is not a surprise given the nexus between Venezuela’s military and drug trafficking.\\nThe Venezuelan opposition, watchdog groups and some Latin American neighbours have long accused the Venezuelan government – especially the military – of having ties to the drug trade, particularly in the country’s west, along the border with Colombia. President Nicolas Maduro’s government has always denied any criminal connections.\\nMaduro has repeatedly alleged that the US is hoping to drive him from power.\\n",
