            "description": "Hong Kong’s exports surged by more than 30 per cent in the first month of 2026, thanks to a rebound from last year’s low base after US-China trade war fears eased.\nAccording to the Census and Statistics Department, the total value of Hong Kong’s export of goods rose in January by 33.8 per cent year on year to HK$520.6 billion (US$66.6 billion), while the value of imports surged by 38.1 per cent to HK$534.7 billion.\n“Exports to most markets and of most major commodities increased visibly,” a government spokesman said on Friday.\n“While the low base of comparison last year amid the early arrival of Chinese New Year contributed to the strong year-on-year rise, the underlying growth momentum remained robust.”\nHe added that on a seasonally adjusted basis, the value of merchandise exports in a three-month period ending January picked up by 9.4 per cent compared with the preceding three-month period.\nThe second trade war began after United States President Donald Trump took office in January last year and imposed a 10 per cent tariff on China in early February.\n\nThe two nations struck what the White House called a “historic” agreement in November. Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies subsequently appeared to de-escalate.\n“Looking ahead, Hong Kong’s merchandise trade performance will be underpinned by the sustained moderate expansion of the global economy and strong global demand for AI-related electronic products,” the spokesman said.\n“Meanwhile, the government will stay vigilant to the trade policy developments in the external environment.”\nThe latest figures also showed a trade deficit of HK$14.1 billion, equivalent to 2.6 per cent of the value of imports of goods, was recorded in January 2026.\nIn a statement last month, the department said that Hong Kong’s exports in 2025 rose by 15.4 per cent year on year to a “historical high”.\nIt added that authorities expected the city’s trade would continue to be supported by sustained global economic growth, improved ties with new markets and strong demand for artificial intelligence-enabled products.\n",

It was created by Taiwanese artist Will Chen Wei-hua.\nThe launch came two months after Pop Mart’s previous debut, Supertutu, and is part of the company’s efforts to speed up the roll-out of new intellectual properties (IPs) beyond its most successful character, Labubu. Like Supertutu, however, Merodi’s launch has so far drawn an underwhelming response.\nThe new IP was released online at 10pm on Thursday night and was still available on Friday, unlike many of the toymaker’s more popular characters, which often sold out shortly after debut, including Twinkle Twinkle. Last August, mini Labubus sold out in 60 seconds.\nInvestors, however, seem confident. On Friday, Pop Mart’s shares closed more than 2 per cent higher at HK$229.80.\n\n“We think the new IPs require a longer cycle to raise their profile among customers,” said Jeff Zhang, an equity analyst at Morningstar. “With fashion risks remaining high, it’s natural to see some IPs failing to reach critical mass eventually, and Pop Mart will adjust product roll-outs accordingly.\n“We think Pop Mart will keep launching new IPs to capture fans’ preferences, so the tepid response to one or two may not significantly impact its reputation.”\nRichard Lin, chief consumer analyst at investment bank SPDB International, said Labubu was not an overnight hit.\n“It wasn’t actually that popular before [K-pop girl group Blackpink member] Lisa helped popularise it,” Lin said. “It needs to gain traction on social media first.”\nAs Labubu’s meteoric rise cools, Pop Mart faces challenges in turning hype into stable IP.\nIn 2024, Labubu dolls began to gain global attention after Lisa posted photos of herself with the plush toys as well as keychain pendants on Instagram. Since then, celebrities such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and David Beckham have endorsed the “ugly cute” character.\nLabubu was at one point in 2025 priced at more than 20 times its retail value in secondary markets, becoming Pop Mart’s most successful line to date.\nPop Mart’s share price dropped from a peak of HK$339.80 in late August last year to HK$187.70 by the end of 2025 as prices of some of Labubu models in the secondary market fell, fuelling debate over whether the company’s success had become too reliant on short-lived hype.\nFor the full year, Labubu’s sales volume exceeded 100 million units, chairman Wang Ning said at an internal gala, according to mainland media.\nOn Friday morning, shoppers at the Pop Mart store in Causeway Bay were seen shaking Labubu or Twinkle Twinkle blind boxes, hoping to guess what is inside, while a queue formed at the checkout counter.\nAs for Merodi, a salesperson said: “It is cute.

            "description": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz visited China’s eastern tech hub of Hangzhou on Thursday and met leading figures including those from Alibaba Group Holding and Unitree Robotics, signalling growing international recognition of the country’s robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.\nMerz had lunch and took group photos with local entrepreneurs, including Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu Yongming and Unitree founder and CEO Wang Xingxing, according to a social media account run by Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television CCTV. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nHe met representatives from 10 companies in Hangzhou that specialise in AI, humanoid robots and electric vehicles (EVs). Other companies at the meeting included AI glasses start-up Rokid, brain-machine interface innovator BrainCo, and EV makers Geely and Leapmotor.\n\nThe stop in Hangzhou, the capital of eastern Zhejiang province, marked the conclusion of Merz’s first official trip to China, reflecting Germany’s attempt to work further with the engines of China’s digital and robotics economy. Analysts also expected it to strengthen Merz’s position when he meets US President Donald Trump in early March.\nA highlight of the visit was Merz’s tour of Unitree, a leader in humanoid robots. Unitree’s Wang showcased humanoids dancing, boxing and performing martial arts, according to a report by CCTV.\nWang said on Thursday on social media that it was an honour to meet Merz and that he looked forward to “collaborating with global enterprises for mutual success”.\n\nMerz tried on Rokid’s AI glasses and expressed “strong interest and appreciation for the product”, according to the Hangzhou-based company.\n“Through these glasses, we see a vast future for Sino-German cooperation,” said Misa Zhu, founder and CEO of Rokid, in a statement on Thursday. “Rokid is willing to combine China’s digital innovation with Germany’s precision craftsmanship to deepen cooperation in areas such as smart cockpits and industrial manufacturing, achieving mutual empowerment.”\nEarlier in Beijing, Merz met entrepreneurs including Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun, JD.com founder and chairman Richard Liu Qiangdong and William Li Bin, founder and CEO of EV maker Nio, according to CCTV.\nMerz also attended a Mercedes-Benz autonomous driving showcase where he experienced a system developed by Chinese start-up Momenta, which said the German chancellor highly praised the collaboration.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong employees are the least happy among eight Asia-Pacific economies, including Singapore, with only 47 per cent of local workers reporting that they felt happy at work, a leading job recruitment platform has found.\nOn Friday, Jobsdb released its survey of 1,020 local workers, which also found that 44 per cent of local respondents reported burnout at work and about 66 per cent were dissatisfied with their stress levels.\nHong Kong’s workplace happiness ranked the lowest among the eight markets surveyed, each covering about 1,000 respondents.\nWorkers in Indonesia and the Philippines were the happiest, with 82 per cent and 77 per cent reporting that they felt happy at work, respectively.\nThey were followed by Malaysia at 70 per cent, Thailand at 67 per cent, New Zealand at 65 per cent, Australia at 57 per cent, Singapore at 56 per cent and finally Hong Kong.\n“In the emerging markets, Indonesia and the Philippines, they generally have a more positive and sanguine view of life, so that explains part of the cultural differences between the gap,” said Bill Lee Chern-hsing, managing director of Jobsdb Hong Kong.\nLee said Hong Kong employers often viewed salary increases as the main factor in workers’ happiness, but noted there were other elements they could control that could affect employees’ happiness.\nJobsdb conducted a statistical analysis to rank the importance of workplace happiness drivers among Hong Kong respondents, finding that “purpose at work” was the most important driver, with salary only ranking fifth.\nLee suggested that employers find ways to connect their employees’ work with the wider mission and purpose of their companies.\n“It will help employees feel more involved, that there is a direct impact in what I’m doing every day on what the organisation is doing,” he said.\nResponding to the result of more than four in 10 workers experiencing burnout in Hong Kong, Lee suggested that the issue should be addressed “through open communication and a supportive culture”.\n“When employees feel both purposeful and supported, companies see the payoff. Happy workers are five times more motivated and far less likely to leave.”\n",

            "description": "Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), Hong Kong’s largest developer by market capitalisation, reported a 36.2 per cent year-on-year jump in first-half net profit to HK$10.25 billion (US$1.3 billion).\nRevenue rose 32 per cent to HK$52.7 billion for the six months ended December from a year earlier, while operating income increased 10.7 per cent to HK$13.4 billion, the developer said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday. Underlying profit, which discounts property revaluations, gained 17 per cent to HK$12.2 billion.\nThe revenue, however, missed analysts’ estimates of HK$53.4 billion, while operating income beat forecasts of HK$12.82 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\nHong Kong accounted for HK$46.4 billion of the company’s revenue, followed by the mainland with HK$6.25 billion and other locations with HK$1 million.\nSHKP’s results are typically viewed as a bellwether of the city’s property market, given its extensive project pipeline and the scale of developments slated for completion in the coming years.\nChairman and managing director Raymond Kwok Ping-luen highlighted rising uncertainties brought about by geopolitical risks as well as the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics, noting that they were likely to lead the “global economy into uncharted waters”.\n\n“Despite increasing volatility in the market, anticipated further interest-rate cuts in the US, easing Sino-US tensions and accelerated investment in technology should support moderate global economic growth in 2026,” he said in the statement.\nKwok said the group planned to launch several new residential projects in Hong Kong over the next 10 months, including the second phase of Cullinan Harbour in Kai Tak, a project near the Tsuen Wan West MTR station, a project at Sha Po South in Yuen Long, the first phase of a large-scale development next to the Kwu Tung MTR station, a project near the City One MTR station in Sha Tin and the first phase of the Tung Shing Lei project in Yuen Long.\nSo far this year, the developer has sold out six rounds of sales totalling about 1,400 flats at its Sierra Sea project, the city’s largest residential development since 1999. Sierra Sea, located in Shap Sze Heung, between Sai Kung and Ma On Shan, consists of 9,700 units.\nSHKP’s major projects to be completed in Hong Kong from 2025 up to the end of its 2027-28 financial year would span 1.65 million sq ft to 4.37 million sq ft a year, it said in an earlier filing. Additionally, 10.3 million sq ft would be completed by the end of the 2028-29 financial year and beyond.\nInvestors have turned increasingly optimistic on Hong Kong’s property sector, singling out SHKP as a key beneficiary due to its 19.7 million sq ft of developable land, much of it tied to the government’s Northern Metropolis project, according to a note by Citi on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, annual earnings at Hysan Development, the largest commercial landlord in Causeway Bay, rose 28.3 per cent to HK$2.5 billion in 2025, driven mainly by the fair value gain from the disposal of flats in its upscale Bamboo Grove project in Mid-Levels, according to its filing on Thursday.\nIts recurring underlying profit, however, dropped 1.9 per cent to HK$1.91 billion, with chairman Irene Lee Yun-lien saying that “2025 was a pivotal year of progress and transformation for Hysan”.\nHysan’s turnover rose 1.6 per cent to HK$3.46 billion, with revenue from residential sales jumping 5 per cent, retail rising 2.6 per cent and office reporting flat growth.\nLast year, the company handed over 54 units in Bamboo Grove to buyers, with sales amounting to about HK$1.82 billion. With the units’ carrying value at HK$1.22 billion, Hysan said the disposal resulted in a fair value gain of HK$592 million.\nLooking ahead, Lee said 2026 would “present its own set of challenges”, but added that the group would be “battle-proven and ready”.\nHysan’s Lee Garden Eight project, a 1 million sq ft commercial development, will be ready in the third quarter of the year and will expand the company’s Lee Gardens leasable portfolio by about 30 per cent.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s finance chief has assured the public that the city can manage its debt after proposing the issuance of more bonds to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis, expressing confidence in the long-term investment returns from the megaproject.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po sought to reassure the public during a radio programme on Friday after a university student voiced concerns that his generation might suffer if the city failed to repay the growing number of bonds issued by the current administration.\nIn his latest budget, Chan proposed raising the borrowing cap of two bond programmes from HK$700 billion to HK$900 billion (US$89.4 billion to US$115 billion), describing this as a “balanced” approach that could fast-track the development of the Northern Metropolis and other public works projects.\nHe explained on Friday that land revenue would no longer be sufficient to cover the government’s capital works expenditure, prompting the authorities to rely more on bond issuance to finance infrastructure investment.\nHowever, a caller, a university student surnamed Choi, told Chan he was concerned the government might struggle to repay the debt.\n“In like 10 or 20 years later, if your estimates are unfortunately found to be inaccurate and the economic returns are not as high as expected, then it is possible that Hong Kong would not be able to repay the bonds and it’s likely to burden my generation. I believe that no one wants this to happen,” he said.\n\nThe student questioned whether the government was confident that the economic returns on the investment would be sufficient to repay the HK$900 billion in bonds, and whether a future administration would resist issuing new bonds to pay off old ones.\nChan said the income from bond issuance would be used solely for infrastructure investment.\n“It won’t be applied to fund our operating expenditure. This is a physical discipline that we strictly adhere to,” he said.\nHe added that the government would expedite land formation and infrastructure development in the Northern Metropolis to attract business, technology and manufacturing enterprises.\n“When these companies set up their operation, they will contribute to my tax income, to our employment, to our GDP,” he said.\nChan reassured listeners that the city’s debt-to-GDP level — currently at 14.4 per cent — remained “very safe” by international standards, even though the budget projects it will rise to 19.9 per cent over the next five years.\n“We are very confident with the growing economy [and] with the investment, we will be able to service this debt,” he said.\nOn geopolitical uncertainties and ongoing tariff regimes from the United States, Chan said the city had built a “strong buffer” to withstand various volatilities.\n\n\n\n\nHe added that Hong Kong should seize the opportunities arising from current circumstances to position itself strategically, noting that a significant amount of capital continued to flow into the city, making it a safe haven amid global geopolitical tensions.\nDuring the radio show, another caller questioned the government’s decision to cut kindergarten funding, noting that Hong Kong already had one of the lowest birth rates in the world.\nThe education sector earlier warned that cancelling two kindergarten grants for the new school year would cost each subsidised preschool about HK$40,000 on average.\nChan said his latest budget also proposed increasing the existing child allowance and personal allowance, allowing a family with two children to enjoy additional disposable income from tax reductions of slightly more than HK$10,000.\n",

            "description": "A brand new light show to replace Hong Kong’s 22-year-old “A Symphony of Lights” will be launched in various sightseeing spots, such as The Peak, as early as the second half of this year, the city’s tourism minister has said.\nSecretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui also said on Friday that the new show would build on last year’s “Immersive Light Show in Central”, which featured dynamic 3D projections and adaptable themes.\nAccording to the latest budget unveiled on Wednesday, the city will bring down the curtain on A Symphony of Lights, a nightly laser-and-light display synchronised across dozens of buildings since 2004.\n“Over the past 20 years, A Symphony of Lights has been optimised and updated many times, but relying solely on laser performances from buildings has become somewhat insufficient,” Law said.\n“After gathering feedback over the past year, we have decided not to allocate resources for major modifications to it.”\nShe added that authorities would organise special farewell events to mark the end of the two-decade-old show.\nLaw described the transition as a move towards greater flexibility and engagement.\nShe noted that the light show held at the Hong Kong WinterFest last year, which projected 3D festive animations with music onto eight buildings in Central, had “received very good responses” and offered greater flexibility and changeable themes.\nThe Tourism Board was actively exploring light festival concepts at established tourist spots, with The Peak cited as a key site that could draw repeat visits, Law said.\n“The Peak is a place many tourists go to on their first trip to Hong Kong,” she noted.\n“If they come several times, they might not return, but if we introduce something like a light festival to create an atmosphere, it will greatly enhance the appeal of this traditional attraction at night.”\n\nLaw said the new events would align with festive periods, such as the Mid-Autumn Festival and Halloween, to maximise their impact.\nBut they would not be offered daily, so as to encourage return trips.\n“I’ve often said lately, [it’s about the] fear of missing out – if the light shows are only tied to festivals or special themes, you won’t see it if you don’t come to Hong Kong at that time,” Law said.\n“So you must come at a specific time to watch it. After seeing it once, you won’t say ‘I’ve seen it before, so no need to come again’, because the next time there’s another attractive theme, you might feel it’s worth coming back for that.”\nLaw said the government would reveal further details of the show, including its expected cost, later.\n“We have to be very responsive, so authorities will not wait five or 10 years to review – we have to make adjustments all the time to keep pace,” she said.\n",

            "description": "Semiconductor designer Hygon Information Technology and supercomputer maker Sugon, two stalwarts of China’s tech self-reliance efforts, reported surging revenue for 2025 amid strong domestic demand for home-grown computing systems.\nThe two Shanghai-listed companies’ latest financial results reflect a broader trend across China’s public and private sectors to increase engagement with domestic technology suppliers, as artificial intelligence development projects in the country intensified.\nHeadquartered in Beijing, Hygon posted revenue of 14.4 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) last year, a 56.9 per cent jump from 2024. Profit attributable to shareholders reached 2.54 billion yuan, up 32 per cent from a year earlier.\nHygon attributed the hefty sales growth to the “continued rise in demand for domestically produced high-end chips”. The company said its market share in high-end processors expanded amid cooperation with original equipment manufacturers and other partners in key industries and fields.\nThe firm expected even faster growth – between 62.9 per cent and 75.8 per cent – this first quarter, driven by increased investment in research and development due to “demand from the AI industry”.\n\nSugon, which makes high-performance computing systems and is the largest shareholder of Hygon, posted a 13.9 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue to 14.97 billion yuan last year. Its net profit rose 10.5 per cent to 2.11 billion yuan.\nThe strong performance of Hygon and Sugon also indicated the urgency in China to strengthen support for its domestic supply chain, as US tech restrictions and geopolitical tensions continue to affect the country’s technology sector.\nDespite major demand from Chinese AI companies, imports of Nvidia’s H200 graphics processing units into the country remain in limbo.\nChina, meanwhile, has continued to invest massive resources to build computing capacity amid a heated AI arms race with the US. In the five years to June 2025, the number of gigabit broadband users in the country grew 34-fold to 226 million, substantially lifting the country’s computing power demand.\nIn December, Hygon and Sugon called off plans for a mega-merger after months of talks, citing how “the market environment has changed significantly since the initial planning stages of this transaction”.\nThey said the factors affecting their respective stocks included “changes in the domestic and international environment, the overall trend of the mainland share market, changes in the artificial intelligence industry’s popularity and market expectations” .\nThe aborted merger dashed industry expectations that consolidating the assets of Sugon and Hygon would create a major domestic ecosystem covering advanced processors and high-performance servers.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings has vowed to pursue all possible legal action, both domestically and internationally, to protect its interests, calling Panama’s move to take over its two ports unlawful.\nThe conglomerate, led by the family of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, issued the warning in its second statement in a week after the Panama Maritime Authority acted on a presidential decree allowing it to take over and operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports at either end of the Panama Canal.\nThe move followed a Supreme Court ruling last month that declared unconstitutional the law approving the concession held by CK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company (PPC).\n“PPC has been advised that the ruling, the executive decree and corresponding actions taken by the Panama state relating to the operations of PPC’s terminals at the two ports are inconsistent with the relevant legal framework and the law that approved the concession contract,” the statement read.\n“The group continues to work with its legal counsel, has reserved all its rights, and intends to take all legal steps properly available to it to protect the group’s interests including recourse to additional national and international legal proceedings in the matter.”\nOn Tuesday, CK Hutchison had already condemned what it described as the uninvited takeover of its ports by Panamanian authorities, calling it “the culmination of a campaign” against PPC.\nIt said the government representatives had made direct physical entry into the two ports, telling PPC that the concession “no longer exists” and instructing its staff to follow their orders “under threat of criminal prosecution”.\n\n\n\n\nThe conglomerate warned that Panama would be responsible for “any harm and damage caused by the confiscatory actions it has taken”.\nSecretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau Ying-wah, earlier lodged a “strong protest” with Panama’s consul general in the city, expressing dissatisfaction with Panama’s actions and stressing that the government was firmly committed to safeguarding the rights of Hong Kong’s overseas enterprises.\nPanama’s takeover caps a year-long dispute over control of the two ports on the key shipping route, which has become a flashpoint in the geostrategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing.\nUS President Donald Trump had pledged to “take back” the canal from what he claimed was Chinese control.\nThe dispute also intersected with a separate attempt by CK Hutchison to sell more than 40 ports worldwide in a multibillion-dollar deal with a consortium led by US asset management giant BlackRock and shipping group MSC.\nThe deal drew the ire of Beijing, with Chinese regulators subsequently launching a comprehensive antitrust review in late March 2025, effectively halting the sale.\nReports indicated that Beijing sought a greater role for state-owned shipping giant Cosco in any arrangement involving the Panama terminals.\n",

            "title": "Nvidia reports record earnings quarter as China’s H200 sales freeze persists",
            "description": "Nvidia has yet to generate any revenue from its H200 chips in China and does not know if any sales will be allowed in the country, the company said, as the US chip giant reported record quarterly revenue on surging demand for data centre processors.\nWhile the Santa Clara-based tech giant remains the primary beneficiary of the global generative artificial intelligence boom, its ability to navigate the US-China tech war has become a challenge, with the pipeline for the H200 – Nvidia’s second-most powerful graphics processing unit to date – still dry in China.\nNo revenue had been booked from H200 chips and imports by China remained uncertain, despite small amounts being cleared by Washington for China-based customers, said Colette Kress, Nvidia’s executive vice-president and chief financial officer, during a post-earnings call on Thursday.\nThe remarks echoed those of US Commerce Department official David Peters, who said on Tuesday that Nvidia had yet to sell any H200 units in China.\nThe comments underscore regulatory uncertainty from Beijing regarding the imports of the GPU, which remains a key option for Chinese tech giants to train their AI models, after it was cleared by Washington in January on condition that the shipments do not exceed 50 per cent of the volume sold in the US.\nKress also flagged rising competition in China, where domestic chipmakers have rushed to initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent months to meet soaring demand and position themselves as alternatives to Nvidia.\n\n“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term,” said Kress, who added that the US must “engage every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China” to maintain its leadership in AI computing.\nNvidia’s revenue in China fell to US$19.7 billion for the financial year ended January 25, down from US$25 billion a year earlier, according to its latest earnings release.\nJensen Huang, president and CEO of Nvidia, struck an upbeat tone, highlighting the company’s deeper partnerships this quarter with leading frontier model makers including OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and xAI, which will use Nvidia’s Blackwell and coming Rubin processors for training and inference.\nThe optimism was reflected in the company’s quarterly earnings. It reported a revenue of US$68.1 billion for the quarter ended on January 25, up 73 per cent from a year earlier, beating the consensus estimate of US$65.8 billion. That was largely attributed to growth in its data centre revenue, which surged 75 per cent year on year to a record US$62.3 billion.\nFor the current financial quarter, it expected revenue to be around US$78 billion, compared with US$26 billion from the same period last year, also above forecasts.\nHuang said the company was able to move quickly because global demand for tokens had “gone completely exponential” as the industry went through an inflection point.\n“We know that the amount of computation necessary for the modern way of doing software is growing exponentially, and our strategy is to deliver an entire AI infrastructure every single year,” he said.\nThe earnings came amid concerns about AI’s economic impact, after a report by US research outfit Citrini forecast mass unemployment and recession by 2028 due to agentic AI models. The warning triggered a sell-off on Wall Street, as investors feared traditional business models could be cannibalised.\n“At a system level, we expect Nvidia to continue to be the leader across both training and reasoning-focused inference workloads,” Citi Research analysts said in a recent note. As rising capital expenditure levels among US hyperscalers raised concerns over an AI bubble, these investments would reaccelerate industry revenue and earnings growth, they added.\nNvidia shares initially jumped nearly 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the earnings beat before paring gains to trade flat.\n",

            "title": "On This Day|Legendary Hong Kong actor Ng Man-tat dies at 70 in 2021 – SCMP archive",
            "description": "This article was first published on February 27, 2021.\nBy Phila Siu\nLegendary Hong Kong actor Ng Man-tat, best known for co-starring alongside “king of comedy” Stephen Chow Sing-chi in many popular films, died on Saturday afternoon of liver cancer. He was 70.\nNg’s friend, Tenky Tin Kai-man, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, said the famous actor died peacefully at Tai Wai’s Union Hospital at 5.16pm, accompanied by his children and wife.\n“He left peacefully,” Tin said at the hospital. “He died in his sleep.”\n\nTin said earlier in the day Ng did not know his condition was so serious and had expected to recover.\nNg was born in Xiamen, in southeastern China, in 1951, and came to Hong Kong at the age of five. In the 1970s he attended acting classes organised by Television Broadcasts, and was a classmate of Chow Yun-fat, another renowned actor.\n\nHe started drawing public attention for his roles in the television programme called Chor Lau-heung, which was first broadcast in 1979.\nHis first film in 1981, Heroic Cops, was about illegal immigrants in Hong Kong.\nJust when Ng started rising to fame in the 1980s, he fell into a haze of drinking, gambling and womanising that left him with a debt of HK$300,000 (US$38,680). He sought help from his friend Chow Yun-fat, but was rejected.\n“I’d feel ashamed if I had to declare bankruptcy. I realised that I needed to figure a way out. I didn’t dare telling my family at the beginning and so I went to find [Chow Yun-fat],” Ng said in an interview in mainland China some years ago.\n“He did quite well in Hong Kong. He was popular and had made a lot of money. I asked him to lend me HK$300,000 in the 1980s, but he would not do so. I was upset. He wouldn’t lend me the money and wouldn’t say why.”\nHe realised that Chow would not give him money because that would not ultimately help him. He declared bankruptcy, worked hard, and worked his way up again. He was later thankful that Chow did not lend him the money.\nHe starred with Stephen Chow in the television dramas The Final Combat and The Justice of Life in the late 1980s and viewers fell in love with the pair’s chemistry.\n\nThereafter, he took part in many comedies with Stephen Chow, including All for the Winner in 1990 and Shaolin Soccer in 2001, which was the pair’s last film together.\nEarlier this month, Ng was asked in a mainland Chinese television programme if he would work with Stephen Chow again on a film.\nHe replied: “I’m not dead yet and he hasn’t retired. There’ll definitely be a chance.”\n\nNg was also a household name on the mainland. He starred in the mainland Chinese sci-fi blockbuster, The Wandering Earth, in 2017.\nThe news of his death has attracted more than 2.1 billion views on Weibo, China’s microblogging site.\n",

            "title": "Which Hong Kong government departments get budget boosts while others face cuts?",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s innovation and technology (I&amp;T), intellectual property and investment promotion departments will receive budget increases of at least 10 per cent in the coming financial year, even as the government moves to curb recurrent spending, while the environmental branch and public broadcaster face sharp cuts of 70 and 28 per cent, respectively.\nThe Home and Youth Affairs Bureau will expand its civil service workforce by 16 per cent in 2026-27 – the largest increase among all departments – even as the overall civil service headcount shrinks by 2 per cent.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced in his annual budget on Wednesday that the government’s recurrent expenditure would be cut by 2 per cent in 2026–27, even after the city’s coffers returned to surplus.\nHowever, the individual budgets of all bureaus and departments showed that nine would see rises of more than 10 per cent. These include the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Digital Policy Office, the Intellectual Property Department and InvestHK, with increases ranging from 11 to 27 per cent.\nThe new spending covers initiatives such as establishing the AI Research and Development Institute and expanding the use of artificial intelligence (AI), launching the IP Academy pilot programme, and pursuing measures to help mainland Chinese firms in “going global” and attract strategic industries and enterprises, as outlined in their budgets.\n\n\n\n\nThis year’s budget focused on I&amp;T development and pledged significant support and investment in key areas such as AI and intellectual property.\nThe Housing Bureau recorded the largest overall budget increase, rising from HK$1.96 billion (US$250 million) in 2025-26 to HK$5.34 billion this financial year.\nThe bulk of that amount – HK$4 billion – was earmarked for the long-term resettlement of Wang Fuk Court residents who lost their homes in the deadly fire in November.\nFunding for the Labour Department also rose by 33 per cent, due to higher cash flow needs for the subsidy scheme following the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) offsetting arrangement.\nHowever, 11 departments tightened their budgets significantly, cutting expenditure by more than 10 per cent.\nThe environmental branch under the Environment and Ecology Bureau had the largest reduction, with its budget slashed by 70 per cent. This stemmed from reduced cash flow requirements after the government extended the validity of unused relief balances under the electricity charges relief scheme.\n\nThe government had earlier announced that households yet to use up their distributed relief could do so before the end of this year.\nRTHK, the city’s public broadcaster, and the Information Services Department will have their budgets cut by 28 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, after wrapping up production and promotional efforts for last year’s National Games.\nThe financial services branch of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Legislative Council Commission, and the Government Logistics Department all received increases in their finalised 2025–26 budgets compared with the preliminary budget released last year.\nAnother of the government’s cost-control measures involved trimming the civil service establishment by 2 per cent in each of the next two financial years.\nThis will bring the number of government posts down from 192,416 to 187,429 by next March, a reduction of 2.6 per cent.\nSeveral bodies, however, will have their headcounts increased.\nThe Home and Youth Affairs Bureau will expand from 194 to 225 posts, a 16 per cent increase. Its salary expenditure will increase from HK$137 million in 2025–26 to HK$150 million in 2026–27.\nA spokesman for the bureau said the larger workforce was mainly due to the creation of time-limited posts to assist in the preparation and coordination of activities and celebration programmes for the 30th anniversary of the city’s handover next year.\nInvestHK and the city’s economic and trade offices will also expand by 5 per cent, excluding non-civil service staff.\nThe Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau faces the sharpest reduction, from 401 posts to 310 by next March, representing a 23 per cent decrease.\nA bureau spokesman said the posts cut were related to the National Games Coordination Office, which was not being retained following the Games.\nSecretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi-yan earlier stressed that the plan did not impose “zero growth” across every department, noting they could still create new posts based on operational needs, provided the need was fully justified.\n",

            "description": "Huawei Technologies is aiming for a major international comeback, with the overseas release of its latest flagship smartphone, the Mate 80 Pro, alongside a new smartwatch and the addition of a “wheelchair mode” to its wearable devices.\nPowered by the company’s self-designed, China-made Kirin 9030 Pro processor, the overseas version of its Mate 80 Pro handsets will run on the Android-based EMUI 15 operating system, Huawei announced at a launch event in Madrid, Spain, on Thursday.\nWhile the domestic version of the Mate 80 Pro runs on Huawei’s proprietary HarmonyOS, the overseas model, priced at 1,299 euros (US$1,533), shares the same in-house system-on-a-chip, which the company touted as its most advanced for handsets.\nThe overseas roll-out of the Mate 80 Pro, which was launched in China in November, marked the Shenzhen-based tech giant’s comeback with its bar-type Mate models in the international market, four years after its launch of the Mate 50 series in 2022.\nThe Madrid launch also showed Huawei’s renewed push into the global smartphone market, after it overcame crippling US tech sanctions to successfully return as a domestic leader in China, the world’s largest smartphone market.\nIn 2025, Huawei edged out Apple to reclaim the No 1 spot in mainland China’s smartphone market, capturing a 16.4 per cent share to narrowly beat the iPhone maker’s 16.2 per cent, according to data from research firm IDC in January.\n\nThat was the first time Huawei secured a full-year lead on the mainland since 2020, after the US tightened sanctions on the company and cut off its access to advanced chips.\nThe Madrid event also saw the debut of Huawei’s Watch GT Runner 2, a timepiece for professional and amateur runners, that the company developed with two-time Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge and his team as partners.\nBased on five years of research and development, the watch features an intelligent positioning algorithm designed to ensure precision despite signal interruptions, according to Huawei.\nHuawei also rolled out a wheelchair mode in its smartwatches to serve the estimated 80 million wheelchair-bound people around the world.\nThat mode will initially be supported on the new Watch GT 6 Series, the company said.\nHuawei skipped the global release of the past two standard Mate series until the international roll-out of the Nova 14 and the tri-fold Mate X7 model last year.\nThe company, however, faced an uphill battle overseas, as Apple and Samsung Electronics continue to dominate the global smartphone market.\nApple held a 24 per cent, while Samsung had an 18 per cent, respectively, in global smartphone shipments in 2025, IDC data showed.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong’s higher stamp duty will not stop luxury homebuyers from China",
            "description": "The increase in stamp duty on ultra-luxury homes above HK$100 million (US$12.8 million) is unlikely to change buying behaviour, analysts said, as the structural forces underpinning demand from mainland Chinese buyers could outweigh the impact of the rise in transaction costs.\nThe Hong Kong government, in the annual budget on Wednesday, increased the tax rate on residential transactions above HK$100 million to 6.5 per cent from 4.25 per cent amid a surge in demand for high-end property from mainland buyers.\nProperty agents said the 2.25 percentage-point rise in transaction costs would not significantly impact mainland Chinese demand. They added that the authorities were likely seeking to prevent overheating before momentum accelerates further in the trophy-home segment.\n“The government saw a sudden increase in large-ticket transactions this year, which signals returning confidence,” said Louis Ho Siu-tong, senior associate director at Centaline Property covering The Peak and the Southern district. “They do not want prices to rise too quickly.”\n\nThe move came as mainland Chinese purchasers accounted for about 80 per cent of HK$100 million-plus transactions in prime districts this year, according to Centaline. A total of 48 such deals worth HK$10.4 billion were completed year-to-date as of Wednesday, Centaline said. There were a total of 262 transactions worth HK$53.1 billion in 2025.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech that buyers with “greater financial means” should “contribute more”, expecting to raise about HK$1 billion annually from the higher stamp duty.\nThe broader housing market has also started to show signs of stabilisation. Lived-in home prices rose 3.66 per cent in 2025, ending three consecutive years of decline.\nPrices of larger homes measuring at least 1,076 sq ft gained 2.93 per cent last year, though they remain about 19 per cent below their October 2021 peak. In January, 26 such deals worth HK$5.3 billion were recorded, up 70 per cent in volume and 50 per cent in value from a month earlier, according to Centaline.\nThe stronger-than-expected property market momentum has prompted global investment banks to cluster around a more bullish view for 2026, with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs joining Morgan Stanley in projecting double-digit gains.\nJoseph Tsang, chairman of JLL in Hong Kong, said January’s spike partly reflected several ultra-large transactions, including Swire Properties’ HK$2.6 billion sale of two three-storey units at 6 Deep Water Bay Road to a buyer from the mainland.\n“The surge somewhat coincided with a few big-ticket deals,” Tsang said, cautioning against reading the figures as a straight-line trend.\nThe Hong Kong dollar’s relative weakness has made local assets appear cheaper for yuan-based buyers. Mortgage rates have also eased in recent months, reducing financing costs.\nMore fundamentally, Tsang said, wealthy mainland individuals increasingly viewed Hong Kong property as a means of allocating capital within an internationally connected financial system, where proceeds could be held and redeployed offshore with greater flexibility.\n“There is a clear desire to place their assets in a market with an internationally connected financial system,” he said.\nRecent transactions illustrate the strength of demand. Earthstone paid HK$323 million for a 4,566 sq ft flat at Mount Nicholson, about 3.5 per cent higher than its previous sale price in 2016. Company filings showed Fu Songyang, founder of Beijing-based luxury-car dealer FFF-Automobile, was a director of the purchasing company.\nIn another deal, Alphabase Investments acquired a four-bedroom unit at The Legacy in Mid-Levels West for HK$158 million. Land Registry records identified Yuan Yuwei, a director of the acquiring entity, as the buyer.\nGiven these drivers, property agents said the higher stamp duty might have a limited impact.\n“Mainlanders were buying luxury homes even when there was a 30 per cent tax,” said Centaline’s Ho, referring to the additional duties that were scrapped in 2024. “They will definitely buy now.”\n",

            "description": "A Hong Kong doctor and a clinic operator were arrested on Thursday in a joint operation by police and health authorities on a Causeway Bay medical facility suspected of performing high-risk hair transplant procedures without a valid licence.\nAuthorities raided the clinic located in the Cameron Commercial Centre on Hennessy Road after receiving a tip-off that it was offering Regenera Activa (RGA) – an autologous cell transplant treatment for hair loss – despite not having the required day procedure centre licence.\nDuring the operation, officers seized medical devices and instruments that could be used for RGA procedures along with patient records, and arrested a doctor and the person in charge of the clinic.\n“The doctor involved is suspected of performing high-risk medical procedures on premises without an appropriate licence, thereby failing to act in the best interests of patients,” a Department of Health spokesman said.\n\n“The investigation is ongoing, and prosecution will be considered based on the evidence collected,” he said, adding the case has been referred to the Medical Council.\nRGA is a hair regrowth treatment that uses a patient’s own cells to stimulate thinning hair. During the process, a doctor extracts small micrografts – tiny skin samples just a few millimetres wide – from a healthy part of the scalp.\nThese samples are then ground down into a liquid and injected back into thinning areas to revitalise inactive hair follicles.\nThe department noted that the transplant of any cells or tissues is classified as a scheduled medical procedure that must by law be carried out at a licensed day procedure centre to ensure patient safety.\nUnder the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance, anyone found operating a day procedure centre without a valid licence faces a maximum penalty of HK$100,000 (US$12,786) and up to three years in jail.\nThe department said it issued a letter to all doctors earlier this month, reminding them to verify that a facility holds the required licence before performing RGA or any other regulated medical procedures to ensure practitioners strictly adhere to the professional code of conduct.\n“The Department of Health reiterates its appeal to the public that, before receiving RGA or other scheduled medical procedures stipulated in the ordinance, they should confirm if the premises had obtained a day procedure centre licence,” the spokesman said.\nEarlier this month, the Consumer Council revealed it receives about 100 complaints annually regarding hair-related services, including transplants, growth treatments and scalp care.\nThese cases often involved disputes over exaggerated results, scalp inflammation and the detachment of artificial hair strands, with many consumers facing significant financial losses, it said.\nThe watchdog urged the public to proactively inquire whether a treatment involves regulated medical procedures and to verify that the service provider holds the necessary professional qualifications.\n",

            "title": "Baidu touts AI chips’ potential amid sluggish fourth quarter",
            "description": "Baidu founder, CEO and chairman Robin Li Yanhong touted the performance and potential of artificial intelligence chips developed by its Kunlunxin semiconductor design unit during the fourth-quarter earnings call, offering a rare bright spot in an otherwise lacklustre quarter.\n“We’re proud to see the market increasingly recognise [Kunlunxin chips’] value and proven performance,” Li said on Thursday.\nThe Kunlunxin chips are built on a proprietary architecture and deliver “stable, high-performance AI computing at scale with broad compatibility across different [AI] models”, Li said, citing strong inference efficiency that has driven broad enterprise adoption across sectors including finance, telecommunications and energy.\nLi’s remarks come as Baidu reported revenue of 32.74 billion yuan (US$4.8 billion) for the fourth quarter, slightly above analysts’ estimates of 32.66 billion yuan, but down 4 per cent from a year earlier, highlighting how growth in the AI-related business was not enough to offset sluggish advertising demand.\n\nRevenue from its AI-related business for the three months ended December, which includes AI cloud, AI applications and AI marketing services, came in at more than 11 billion yuan, up 48 per cent from a year earlier, according to its earnings statement.\nLi said “2025 marked a pivotal year as AI became the new core of Baidu”, adding that the company was confident in “creating lasting value in the AI era”, the statement said.\nRevenue for the full year fell 3 per cent to 129.1 billion yuan.\nBaidu’s fourth-quarter and full-year performance was in line with analysts’ expectations. Analysts from Everbright Securities and China Securities said in research notes that they expected the company’s advertising operations to be weighed down by sluggish demand, while also noting that recent restructuring and investments into AI weighed on short-term revenue.\nIn November, Baidu axed an undisclosed number of jobs that affected some of its major divisions, including the mobile ecosystem group, which houses the bread-and-butter search business.\nIt also reorganised its AI model development operations, creating two separate units for foundational models and application models. The new units are responsible for the Ernie series foundational AI models, reporting directly to Baidu founder Li.\nThe Ernie Assistant’s monthly active users reached 202 million in December, according to the company.\nBaidu has been making active adjustments and investments on the consumer AI applications front, including joining its peers in doling out billions of yuan to promote AI assistants. Chinese tech giants and AI specialist start-ups are competing to build their AI chatbot apps as a gateway to the AI era.\nLast month, Baidu said that Kunlunxin had confidentially filed to list the unit in Hong Kong, riding on the wave of China’s tech-sufficiency push. Investors expect the move to “unlock value” for Baidu.\nBaidu unveiled two new chips from Kunlunxin at its annual developer and client event in November, including the M100, which has been designed to enhance inference efficiency in models using the mixture-of-experts technique, and the M300, tailored for training super-large multimodal models with trillions of parameters.\nThe M100 is set for release this year and the M300 in 2027, according to the company. The chips would provide “powerful, low-cost and controllable AI computing power” to support China’s AI self-sufficiency push, said Shen Dou, Baidu’s executive vice-president and president of its cloud unit.\nBaidu’s Apollo Go autonomous-ride hailing service also delivered an aggregated 20 million rides to the public as of this month, as it expands its global presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\nBaidu’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to close at HK$123.40 on Thursday.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong records HK$2.9 billion consolidated surplus for 2025-26. Here’s how",
            "description": "A combination of a strong initial public offering (IPO) market and bond sales has helped put Hong Kong’s financial health back in the black sooner than expected, with analysts expecting a robust pipeline of listings to be key to sustaining the city’s surplus.\nIn his budget speech on Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the city was previously expected to record a HK$67 billion deficit for the 2025-26 financial year, which ends on March 31, but emerged with an estimated HK$2.9 billion consolidated surplus.\nSome economists on Thursday expressed optimism regarding the outlook for 2026-27, pointing to factors such as the stabilised property market and the transfer of billions of Hong Kong dollars between government funds or accounts.\nBilly Mak Sui-choi, an associate professor at Baptist University’s accountancy, economics and finance department, attributed the operating surplus in 2025-26 directly to the bustling stock market, noting that robust turnover and listing activities were the primary engines for government revenue.\n“The main reason is that in the past year … Hong Kong stock turnover was much larger, so government stamp duty [revenue] increased by a lot, by tens of billions,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nLee Shu-kam, head of Hong Kong Shue Yan University’s economics and finance department, expressed optimism that a compounding effect from new companies coming to Hong Kong, a booming stock market and a recovering property sector would mutually reinforce one another to sustain higher tax revenues.\n“The future situation is relatively optimistic. This year, [the city’s financial health] was mainly supported by corporate profits and returns from the stock market, but if we can attract more companies to Hong Kong in the future, the result will naturally be even better,” he said.\n“If we see more start-ups joining the market, profits benefiting, and the stock market becoming more buoyant – and if the property sector improves amid this – tax revenue will see a compounding increase. The overall picture is optimistic.”\nThe strong IPOs showing gave rise to an estimated stamp duty revenue of HK$99.5 billion in 2025-26, HK$31.9 billion higher than previously thought. Similarly, profits tax revenue beat forecasts by HK$16.8 billion, reaching HK$209 billion.\nThe success of the new listings and strong stock trading also prompted a record profit for the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing two years in a row, with its net profit jumping by 36 per cent to HK$17.75 billion last year.\nThe exchange earlier reported that as of the end of January 2026, more than 400 companies were in the listing pipeline, representing a diverse sector spanning healthcare, materials, technology-media-telecoms and industrials.\nHong Kong finished 2025 as the world’s top venue for IPO fundraising, raising US$37.4 billion across 119 listings.\nRiding on the momentum, the financial secretary has also tasked the bourse with reviewing listing requirements to facilitate the listing of aerospace enterprises.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, bond sales were also a significant contributor to the consolidated surplus.\nThe government issued HK$155 billion in sustainable and infrastructure bonds in 2025-26, which were booked as revenue in the Capital Works Reserve Fund. Repayments for government bonds amounted to about HK$51.69 billion.\nWithout them, the consolidated account would have recorded a deficit of more than HK$100 billion due to heavy capital expenditure.\n“If looking purely at the accounts … one might think it is ‘cooking the books’ [to count debt as revenue],” Lee said. “But following the government’s definition, it is a surplus.”\nMak agreed the surplus figure involved “accounting techniques” but defended the rationale.\n“If you take the thousands of billions needed for the Northern Metropolis and book it all as expenditure in one year, you will definitely have a deficit,” Mak said. “But borrowing money to invest is a financing method, just like taking a mortgage to buy a flat.”\nThe financial secretary explicitly said the bond issuance programme would be expanded to an annual target of HK$160 billion to HK$220 billion for the next five years.\nConsequently, the debt-to-GDP level is projected to rise from 14.4 per cent to 19.9 per cent by 2030-31.\nLee emphasised that the legitimacy of this strategy hinged on how the funds were deployed.\n“Issuing bonds is not for paying civil servants’ salaries or welfare … If it were, that would be a huge problem,” he said. “But if it is used for transport infrastructure … then this bond issuance is completely fine.”\n\n\n\n\nFrench investment bank Natixis described the persistent financial deficit, masked by bond proceeds, as the “new norm” for Hong Kong.\nLooking ahead to 2026-27, the government forecasts a consolidated surplus of HK$22.1 billion, which is heavily buttressed by aggressive fund transfers.\nFor example, the government plans to transfer HK$75 billion in investment income from the Exchange Fund to the Capital Works Reserve Fund and HK$37 billion from the accumulated surplus of the Bond Fund back into government accounts.\nChristopher Hui Ching-yu, secretary for financial services and the treasury, defended the use of Exchange Fund proceeds, saying the transfer involved “extra investment income” rather than the principal capital required to defend the currency peg.\nHe said the debt-to-GDP proportion remained controllable compared with the level of other advanced economies.\nThe Exchange Fund, Hong Kong’s de facto sovereign wealth fund, is used to defend the US dollar currency peg and finance infrastructure development.\n",
