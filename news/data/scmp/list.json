            "title": "Can ancient monastery in Mount Sinai, Egypt, cope with massive increase in tourism?",
            "description": "St Catherine’s Monastery, located at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt and known for its sacred peace, is now preparing to open up to the public.\\nThe Greek Orthodox monastery was founded in the 6th century and is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited Christian monasteries.\\nMoses is said to have received the 10 Commandments on Mount Sinai.\\nThis 1,500-year-old monastery was built where the valley ends and Mount Sinai begins.\\nKnown among the faithful for housing relics of St Catherine of Alexandria, its ancient library of rare manuscripts also draws many pilgrims.\\nGentle breezes blow across barren, reddish-brown rocks, causing rose bushes and olive trees to flutter.\\n\\nSpend a few days here, and what you mostly sense is silence.\\nChristians, Jews and Muslims revere this place, where faith, history and nature all come together in a powerful combination.\\nBut down in the valley, it is bustling with concrete, containers and construction vehicles as today’s Egypt prepares for tomorrow’s tourism.\\nHotels and villas are planned, offering upwards of 1,000 rooms plus a promenade with a bazaar, a Peace Plaza and a visitor centre. The sign is already in place.\\nThe government is celebrating the construction project, which is scheduled for completion in October 2026, as “Egypt’s gift to the whole world and all religions”.\\nA museum and theatre are planned, as well as conference rooms and restaurants. Motorways are being paved and a currently unused airport nearby is being expanded. It is set to cost US$220 million.\\nIt will be a “wonderful destination for all visitors”, whether they come for religious reasons, recreation or nature, says Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly.\\nAccording to state-affiliated media, the aim is to “harness the magic of the region” and transform it into a “must-visit destination”. A large German hotel chain is already on board.\\n\\nBut can a monastery that thrives on peace and seclusion cope with so many visitors? Will not a religious site with a few occasional tourists then become a tourist site with a few religious attractions?\\nA “delicate balance” is needed, says Father Justin, one of 22 monks living in St Catherine’s Monastery. “Open and accessible to a certain extent, but also preserving quiet times and solitude.”\\nThe monks begin their day at 4am and live in line with a “complex schedule that has been in place for centuries”, Father Justin says. The monastery opens to visitors for three hours a day at present. But change is coming. The project represents “the greatest possible contrast to what the area stands for”, according to World Heritage Watch, an organisation dedicated to protecting Unesco World Heritage sites. The area received this status in 2002.\\nUnesco has called on the government in Cairo to present a protection plan, halt the construction work and let observers into the country, but so far, nothing has come of this.\\nThe Bedouin have long been faced with a new reality. Members of the Jabaliya tribe, said to be descended from Byzantine soldiers sent in the 6th century to guard the monastery, are believed to be the oldest tribe in the area. The name “Jabaliya” comes from the Arabic word for “mountain”.\\nThey made the construction and operation of the monastery possible in the first place, acting as protectors, mountain guides and camel drivers. Now, their houses have been demolished during the construction work, and an old cemetery has been destroyed. With their bare hands, they dug up the remains of their relatives to bury them further away. Where the cemetery used to be is now a car park.\\n“They ignore everyone,” says one of the Bedouin of the government’s activities.\\nSt Catherine’s Monastery is in danger of becoming like Sharm el-Sheikh, further south – a place with “five-star hotels and tourists who only stay in their hotels”.\\n\\nAfter being forced into the hinterland in Sharm, many Bedouin make their living from waste recycling.\\nOn Mount Sinai, everything appears to be the same as ever. For some, after a laborious climb, all the energy of St Catherine is released.\\nA Korean tour group is singing Christian songs, and a woman sobs loudly as she says a prayer at the summit. Another sits quietly crying on a rock, watching the sunset.\\nDown in the monastery, the singing of the monks can be heard coming from a loudspeaker in the small shop, and the smell of burning wax from the votive candles fills the air.\\nA few rooms above, the library houses more than 3,300 ancient manuscripts.\\n“You have to protect the people who come here to feel something inside themselves,” says a monk. “Something in their hearts. If you don’t protect it, it becomes a tourist attraction,” he says, placing both hands on his chest.\\n",

            "title": "For Hong Kong’s fiscal health, commercial land sales should resume",
            "description": "The sluggish property market has made government land sales more difficult. With the economy still volatile and public confidence fragile, developers and homebuyers are understandably cautious when making investment decisions. Officials should monitor market sentiment closely and adjust relevant policies accordingly in a prudent and timely manner. If the latest residential property prices are any reference, the market has apparently bottomed out.\\nData from the Rating and Valuation Department shows that lived-in home prices rose 1.3 per cent in September, logging the biggest gains so far this year and reaching the highest in more than a year. The increase marks the sixth consecutive month in which the official index has either remained stable or edged higher. Similarly, the Land Registry recorded 78 first-hand residential sales priced between HK$30 million (US$3.86 million) and HK$49.99 million in the first 20 days of October, a 10-month high in transactions involving upmarket deals.\\nConsidering residential prices had fallen 28.4 per cent as of March this year, from their peak in September 2021, the rebound came as a much-needed boost in confidence. The upturn was mainly attributed to a favourable view of easing in interest rates and a resurgence in the recent performance of the local stock market. But whether the optimism is spilling over to the commercial market and the wider economy remains to be seen.\\nSecretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho said it was likely that commercial land sales would be suspended for the second year because of a lack of market demand. This followed a moratorium early this year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply. The minister said supply remained abundant, adding that the government would not earn any land premium if tenders failed amid a lukewarm market response.\\nThat may be true, but the government cannot sit back until the property market has fully recovered. With so many massive development projects in the pipeline, the government must stay ahead of the market and adjust its policies so as to facilitate timely business decisions. This is not only in the interest of the market but also for the sake of land revenues and public fiscal health.\\n",

            "description": "Leading artificial intelligence models from the United States and China are “highly sycophantic”, and their excessive flattery may make users less likely to repair interpersonal conflicts, a new study has found.\\nThe study by researchers at Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University published earlier this month tested how 11 large language models (LLMs) responded to user queries seeking advice on personal matters, including cases involving manipulation and deception.\\nIn AI circles, sycophancy is the phenomenon of chatbots excessively agreeing with users. DeepSeek’s V3, released in December 2024, was found to be one of the most sycophantic models, affirming users’ actions 55 per cent more than humans, compared with an average of 47 per cent more for all models.\\nTo establish the human baseline, one of the techniques the researchers used was based on posts from a Reddit community called “Am I The A**hole”, where users post about their interpersonal dilemmas to ask for the community’s opinion about which party is at fault.\\n\\nThe researchers used posts where community members judged the author of the post to be in the wrong to test whether the LLMs, when given the same scenarios, would align with this predominantly English-speaking online group of humans.\\nOn this test, Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, released in January, was found to be the most sycophantic model, contradicting the community verdict – siding with the poster – 79 per cent of the time. The second highest was DeepSeek-V3, which did so in 76 per cent of cases.\\nIn comparison, the least sycophantic model, Google DeepMind’s Gemini-1.5, contradicted the community verdict in 18 per cent of cases. The research has not been peer-reviewed.\\nAlibaba Cloud is the AI and cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post.\\nThe Qwen and DeepSeek models were the two Chinese models tested, with the others being developed by US firms OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind and Meta Platforms, and French company Mistral.\\nThe issue of AI sycophancy gained widespread attention in April when OpenAI’s update to ChatGPT made the chatbot noticeably more obsequious. The company said at the time that the behaviour raised legitimate concerns surrounding users’ mental health and pledged to improve pre-deployment evaluations of sycophancy for future releases.\\nIn the latest study, published as a preprint, the US researchers also tested the impact of sycophancy on users and found that sycophantic responses reduced their inclination to resolve conflicts amicably. Users rated sycophantic responses as higher quality and trusted the sycophantic models more.\\n“These preferences create perverse incentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and for AI model training to favour sycophancy,” the researchers wrote.\\nAI sycophancy has implications for businesses too, according to Jack Jiang, an innovation and information management professor at the University of Hong Kong’s business school and director of its AI Evaluation Lab.\\n“It’s not safe if a model constantly agrees with a business analyst’s conclusion, for instance,” he said.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong could host a clash between Australian rugby league giants South Sydney Rabbitohs and English side St Helens in 2027, if officials from both clubs have their way.\\nSt Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who played rugby union for Hong Kong, has thrown his considerable influence behind the idea, which would form part of a groundbreaking global round of matches being considered by the NRL in Australia.\\nAnd McManus has reportedly been backed by Blake Solly, CEO of the Rabbitohs, who are sponsored by MG Motor, which is owned by the Chinese car company SAIC Motor.\\nWhile officials in Hong Kong said they had yet to be approached by anyone about the plan, which would see Kai Tak Stadium host one of several games to be played worldwide to start the 2027 season, there was considerable enthusiasm for it among those running sport in the city.\\nAs there has been from McManus, who told Australian newspaper The Age that he had “been pushing Hong Kong for 25 years”.\\n\\n“In the first instance I was pushing it as a venue for the World Cup Challenge,” said McManus, who lived in the city for 20 years. “It just seemed like the natural place to go … and now they’ve got a fantastic new stadium. It’s always been a venue that is open to international sporting events. Obviously, they have the Hong Kong Sevens. The NFL have even played there historically.\\n“The relevant government bodies of the Hong Kong tourist association, trade and commerce, they have historically contributed significant sums to such events. We don’t want to create a circus, but what we should be having is strategic locations and select clubs and select games to hold during the course of the year without undermining our bread and butter: Super League and NRL seasons.”\\nThe global round is an ambitious plan to launch the 2027 season with nine matches in different cities around the world, including London, Dubai and Hong Kong.\\nDriven by Peter V’landys, the Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, one of the options is the potential of almost 24 hours of non-stop rugby league action from around the world, with games in France, Hawaii and Las Vegas, where the Rabbitohs played the Manly Sea Eagles last year, being mooted as part of the plan.\\n“There’s still a lot of work to be done, and we don’t have a huge amount of detail, but we’re very interested in Hong Kong,” Solly told The Age.\\n“Eamonn [McManus] has great contacts and understanding of Hong Kong from his time there. If there was an opportunity to work with St Helens on that game, we’d be very happy to work with Eamonn, Mike Rush [CEO] and the team at St Helens.”\\n",

            "description": "Relations between the world’s two biggest economies urgently need to be stabilised. Not for the first time has it taken a face-to-face meeting between leaders to try to keep them on track. Thursday’s summit in South Korea between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reins in a sustained escalation of trade and political tensions. They made breakthroughs on some thorny bilateral issues.\\n“We have a deal,” Trump proclaimed afterwards. The world will be relieved if the deal clears the way for a more stable, predictable geopolitical environment. It has to be welcomed as a significant breakthrough, considering how fraught relations have become under the Trump administration’s escalation of the trade war with tariffs and tech export curbs.\\nOverall, the summit is a positive result for China that meets realistic expectations, given the deep and structural bilateral issues. Trump has backed down again from his threat of 100 per cent additional tariffs on China over curbs on rare earth exports, which removes a big source of uncertainty and potential risk for markets.\\nA tariff intended to combat fentanyl trafficking to the United States will be reduced from 20 to 10 per cent; this includes Hong Kong and Macau. On other issues, such as shipping and port restrictions, they agreed to suspend the measures for a year – a truce that could help cooler heads prevail. The language on US chip exports and Chinese rare earth exports is vague – it is not surprising that such complex issues cannot be quickly resolved.\\nTrump finalised his proposed visit to Beijing in April. This is very important. He probably will want to wait until then to reveal more deals – if the two sides can reach them. Hopefully, it means that until April there will be political will on both sides to keep things stable.\\nTaiwan was not mentioned, at least in public. That is good for Beijing, which is under no illusion that the US and Western countries will support it over Taiwan. The best it can hope for is that they will largely leave the Taiwan issue to Beijing, to be treated as China’s own affair. In the past, the US president mentioned Taiwan partly as a political gesture and partly as an example for other Western countries. Now, if Trump drops the topic – at least in public – it will make it harder for other Western countries to raise it with Beijing. That is a plus for China.\\nGiven Trump’s style and capacity for backflipping, it may not be plain sailing ahead for bilateral relations. Ultimately, both sides stand to win by keeping ties cordial. Xi echoed this sentiment, according to Xinhua, with his remark to Trump that China and the US should focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, not get “caught in a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation”.\\n",

            "description": "A federal judge in Boston signalled she may rule that the Trump administration is likely to have violated US law in suspending food-aid benefits to millions of low-income US households during the government shutdown, and she criticised the “political game” being played with American lives.\\nAt a court hearing on Thursday, US District Judge Indira Talwani heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by more than two dozen Democratic-led states seeking to keep federal dollars flowing to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme, or Snap.\\nThe judge said she would issue a ruling later in the day.\\nThe US Department of Agriculture previously announced it would halt the programme starting in November until Congress approves a new spending deal. Earlier this month, officials had directed states to stop taking steps to administer the programme ahead of November 1.\\nTalwani bristled at claims by the federal government that it could not tap available emergency funds and that even providing partial payments would be “devastating” and too difficult for states to carry out.\\nThe judge said Congress was trying “to protect the American people,” at a Thursday hearing weighing a request by a coalition of states to force the government to use the emergency funds.\\n“What Congress was trying to do is, if you don’t have enough money, we’ll tighten our belt,” the judge said, not jeopardise people’s well-being because of a “political game”.\\n\\nThe Agriculture Department, which manages the Snap programme, sees those funds as legally unavailable during the shutdown. The US Justice Department lawyer representing the agency went further in court, telling the judge that the agency would probably not access the emergency reserves even if it were legally able to do so.\\n“The agency’s conclusion would likely be that the partial reimbursement would be so disastrous,” said Jason Altabet of DOJ’s civil division, raising concerns that decades-old computer systems could freeze if recalculations are ordered.\\n“They’d conclude the partial reimbursement would be so devastating as to not exercise discretion to do so.”\\nThe court pressed the parties on whether it has the power to issue a nationwide order, noting the Supreme Court’s recent limitations on nationwide injunctions. As such, the lawsuit only sought Snap funds for people in the 25 states and the District of Columbia that filed the legal action.\\nTalwani said she “can’t consider this in terms of only half the nation”.\\nCiting federal law and regulations that appear to anticipate reductions of benefits in some situations, Talwani asked why the government has taken the position that a partial payment with limited emergency funds is “simply too complicated”.\\nA suspension of benefits will exacerbate food insecurity across the country, on top of the strain already facing the millions of federal workers who have not received pay cheques since the shutdown began on October 1.\\nMore than 42 million people in 22 million households nationwide receive Snap benefits, according to government data.\\n\\nThe federal government sends Snap funds to states to administer to eligible residents, who receive the money each month via a benefits card they can use to pay for groceries, similar to a bank debit card.\\nThe lawsuit centres on Snap contingency funds that Congress approved long before the shutdown started on October 1. According to government court filings, there is US$5.25 billion in that reserve fund.\\nCongress also designated money for child nutrition programme,es from the proceeds of import tariffs that the states say also could be used. The administration recently transferred US$300 million from that fund to keep the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programme running during the shutdown.\\nThe Agriculture Department has maintained that it can only use the contingency money to “supplement” existing funds that Congress approved to pay for Snap benefits in a specific financial year.\\nThe reserve money is not available now that there are no longer funds left from the previous financial year, the government argues.\\nThe Democratic officials contend the government must exhaust available funding sources before halting payments for a programme that Congress deemed mandatory.\\nThey said the government’s stance conflicts with guidance that the department published before the shutdown stating that the reserve funds would be available to keep the programme running.\\nSeparate from the Boston case, a coalition of non-profit organisations and city officials from across the country filed a new lawsuit in federal court on Thursday contesting the Snap suspension in Providence, Rhode Island. They also asked a judge to immediately enter a temporary restraining order that restores the benefits for November.\\nAlthough Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they need support from several Democrats to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate and pass a new spending bill. Most Senate Democrats have been united in pressing for a budget deal to include a renewal of expiring health insurance subsidies.\\n",

            "title": "How Hong Kong schools are taking a holistic approach to student assessment",
            "description": "You’ve visited campuses, spoken to teachers, reviewed the curriculum and extracurriculars, and are happy with the academic results. You feel good about the community and have finally chosen the right school for your young child. Congratulations! The hardest part is over.\\nNow for the next step: understanding the admissions assessment. Sometimes this is straightforward, but it can just as easily be an impenetrable fog. Phrases like “social-emotional development skills”, “numeracy, cognitive skills, interpersonal abilities”, “non-verbal and quantitative reasoning”, and “an ability to engage” don’t seem as clear-cut as grades or GPAs.\\nThis shift from purely academic metrics to a more holistic evaluation is intentional. Schools aren’t trying to be obscure. They are trying to get a more complete picture of your child. So how can you navigate this process without getting lost in the jargon?\\nWhy holistic assessments?\\n\\nAccording to Joanne Stanley, director of admissions at French International School, parents shouldn’t get bogged down in defining every term. “These are ways of describing observable learning behaviours, rather than just focusing on test scores,” she says.\\nWhile each school has its own methods, few international schools in Hong Kong rely solely on academics. Non-exam formats are now preferred because they allow educators to evaluate a child’s broader potential, including cognitive abilities like problem-solving and social-emotional skills like cooperation.\\n“This ensures that we’re not just looking at isolated data points, but rather understanding the child as a whole learner and community member,” explains Emily Pong, director of admissions at Canadian International School Hong Kong (CDNIS).\\n\\nThis approach isn’t just for young children. For older students, these same skills are woven into interviews and conversations.\\n“We observe social-emotional and cognitive abilities through structured dialogue and problem solving,” explains Carol Wong, director of admissions and marketing at American School Hong Kong (ASHK). “For instance, we might present a student with a complex, open-ended question or a hypothetical scenario. During the conversation, we observe not just what they answer, but how they think. We look for their ability to articulate a logical thought process, consider different perspectives, adapt their thinking based on new information and demonstrate intellectual curiosity by asking insightful questions.”\\nCommon misconceptions\\n\\nMisconceptions around assessments abound. According to Maria Gebrial, head of prep at Malvern College Hong Kong, the biggest mistake is thinking that the process is purely an academic competition. She cautions against parents coaching their child for assessments, emphasising that, “We are building a community, not just selecting pupils with the highest test scores.”\\n“I always encourage parents to take a step back and see the admissions process as a conversation,” she continues. “We are not judging their child; we are exploring whether our school can be the best fit for their unique talents and interests. Every child has something special to offer, and our job is to see that potential.”\\nThis spirit of cooperation is vital. Charlie Beard, director of learning at International College Hong Kong, notes that honesty about expectations from both sides “enhances the likelihood of finding a suitable environment that supports a child’s growth and success”.\\nEnsuring fairness and objectivity\\n\\nWith terms like “engagement” and “interpersonal abilities”, it’s natural to worry about subjectivity. After all, such terms are not as concrete as a maths problem’s single correct answer. They are complex, multifaceted concepts with no universally agreed-on definition, making it hard to create a test that reliably measures them. So how can schools ensure fairness without a single right answer?\\nEducators stress that holistic analysis is just one part of a multilayered process. Gebrial describes Malvern’s style of assessment as “like putting together a puzzle” – one where non-verbal and quantitative reasoning are just some of the pieces.\\nDuring the conversation, we observe not just what they answer, but how they think\\nCarol Wong, American School Hong Kong\\nSimilarly, Pong says CDNIS relies on “multiple data sources, including teacher recommendations and school reports, to ensure our decisions are balanced and fair”. Meanwhile, Wong explains that at ASHK, “To mitigate unconscious bias, we have standardised rubrics for scoring specific, observable competencies rather than subjective personality traits.”\\nFor globetrotting families – a majority of those considering an international school in Hong Kong – cultural fairness is also a key consideration. Unsurprisingly, the city’s international educators are well aware of this potential issue.\\n“Professional development for educators is key to maintaining cultural fairness in assessments,” says Beard. “Engaging in training focused on cultural competence and inclusive pedagogy enables our educators to recognise their own biases and understand how these might impact assessment design.”\\nWhatever your worries as a parent, Pong’s advice is to help your child feel relaxed and allow them to be themselves at the assessment.\\n“Children perform best when they feel safe and supported, so we encourage families to avoid over-preparing or rehearsing responses,” she says. “A genuine interaction tells us far more than a scripted one.”\\n",
