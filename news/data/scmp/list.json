            "description": "Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has won a landslide election victory, official results showed on Saturday, after key candidates were jailed or barred from a vote that has triggered days of violent protests.\\nThe final result showed Hassan won 97.66 per cent of the vote, dominating every constituency, the electoral commission announced on state television.\\nA quick swearing-in ceremony would take place on Saturday, state TV said.\\nAt stake for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party was its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hoped to lead the country towards political change.\\nStill, a landslide victory is unheard of in the region. Only President Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide.\\n\\nThe main opposition party, Chadema, says hundreds of people have been killed by security forces since protests broke out on election day on Wednesday.\\nHassan was elevated from vice-president on the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, in 2021. She has faced opposition from parts of the army and Magufuli’s allies, and sought to cement her position with an emphatic win, analysts say.\\nRights groups say she oversaw a “wave of terror” in the east African nation ahead of the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.\\nChadema was barred from taking part in the election and its leader put on trial for treason.\\nDespite a heavy security presence, election day descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets across the country, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew.\\nA Chadema spokesman said on Friday that “around 700” people had been killed, based on figures gathered from a network checking hospitals and health clinics.\\nA security source and diplomat in Dar es Salaam both said that deaths were “in the hundreds”.\\n\\nHassan has not made any public statement since the unrest began.\\nHer government denies using “excessive force” but has blocked the internet and imposed a tight lockdown and curfew nationwide, making it hard to get any information.\\nNews websites have not been updated since early Wednesday and journalists are not allowed to operate freely in the country.\\nUN chief Antonio Guterres was “deeply concerned” about the situation in Tanzania, “including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations”, his spokesman said in a statement on Friday.\\nMuch public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the crackdown.\\nThere have been unconfirmed reports of the army siding with protesters in some places, but army chief Jacob Mkunda came out strongly on Hassan’s side on Thursday, calling the protesters “criminals”.\\nForeign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said on Friday that his government had “no figures” on any dead.\\n“Currently, no excessive force has been used,” he said in an interview with Al Jazeera. “There’s no number until now of any protesters killed.”\\nThe political manoeuvring by Tanzanian authorities is remarkable even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multiparty politics in 1992.\\nGovernment critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\\nBut Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\\nA version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since its independence from Britain in 1961, a streak that Hassan extends with her victory.\\nCCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or 10 years.\\nHassan’s orderly transition after Magufuli’s death not long after the start of his second term sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support across the country, especially among rural voters.\\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\\n",

Its shoreline and fish farms have been unaffected.\\nThe Singapore Food Agency is working closely with fish farms in the East Johor Strait to take the necessary preventive measures, while the National Parks Board has not seen any impact on biodiversity-rich sites at Pulau Ubin, Coney Island, Pasir Ris Park and Changi Beach Park.\\nPUB is closely monitoring water quality at Singapore’s coastal reservoirs near the East Johor Strait, and there have so far been no sightings of palm oil near the country’s tidal gates.\\n“We do not expect any impact to operations at our desalination plants, which are located in the southern part of Singapore,” PUB said.\\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore patrol craft that are equipped with absorbent materials and oil recovery equipment are on standby to be activated, if required.\\nUnder the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore can draw up to 250 million gallons (950 million litres) of water a day from the Johor River, and Singapore is obliged to provide Malaysia with treated water up to 2 per cent of the water imported.\\nThe Linggiu Reservoir is located upstream of the Johor River Waterworks and releases water into the Johor River to supplement its flow.\\nWater demand in Singapore is currently about 440 million gallons (1.7 billion litres) a day.\\nAccording to Bernama news agency, Malaysia’s Department of Environment confirmed that damage to a “bund silt pond” was believed to have been caused by sand dredging activities along the Johor River.\\nIt was reported that residents and fishermen in Kota Tinggi had found hundreds of dead fish due to the muddy water in the river.\\nJohor’s water regulatory body, Badan Kawalselia Air Johor, has ordered the sand dredging operation to be stopped immediately.\\nRanhill SAJ, a water company in Johor, said water treatment plants along Johor River had to cease operations due to the contamination, Bernama reported.\\nThis article was first published by CNA\\n",

            "title": "How China’s retired teachers are helping bridge the urban-rural education divide",
            "description": "In 2021, when most of his peers were settling into retirement, 64-year-old Li Ming chose a different path. The law professor – already retired from a leading Beijing university – boarded a six-hour flight from the bustling capital to Tumxuk, a small city deep in western Xinjiang.\\nLi has remained there since, teaching multiple courses to hundreds of students at a local university as part of China’s Silver Age Teaching Programme – a sweeping state policy that mobilises a growing pool of retired urban educators to improve standards in underdeveloped regions.\\nThis year alone, Beijing plans to re-employ 7,000 retired teachers aged 65 and under to work in county towns and rural schools nationwide, according to a recent notice by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance.\\n“One of the biggest differences between urban education and rural education is the quality of the teachers,” said Scott Rozelle, the co-director of the Stanford Centre on China’s Economy and Institutions and its Rural Education Action Program.\\nAs China transitions into a high-income economy, narrowing educational disparities has become an urgent priority, he added, since human capital is an increasing driver of growth and social stability.\\n“When one looks at the share of the labour force that has been to high school, one worries that China’s human capital is not enough to keep it growing on a rapid path for the next several decades,” Rozelle said.\\nOnly about 35 per cent of China’s population had attended high school or higher in 2023, according to the country’s most recent statistical yearbook – a demographic reality underscored by the fact that one-third of its population remains rural.\\nIn contrast, OECD countries average 80 per cent, with half of that figure reaching tertiary education.\\nThese teachers already have pensions. This relieves county governments from financial strains\\nLiang Yan, Willamette University.\\nThe Silver Age Teaching Programme draws on the expertise of retired urban teachers to raise rural education standards. They assist school management by serving as vice-principals, teaching classes and mentoring local staff.\\nLi, for instance, has trained six teaching assistants in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region over the past four years. All have been promoted to lecturers and now form a crucial part of the university staff.\\n“We senior teachers will eventually leave, but we must leave behind a team that will never leave,” he said in an interview with China Youth Daily earlier this year.\\nBut while the programme supplements the existing workforce – with tenures starting at one academic year and extensions available for strong performers – there are concerns that some localities could become too dependent on retired teachers, potentially delaying or limiting permanent recruitment, said Liang Yan, an economist at Willamette University.\\nSome schools have used the programme to fill teaching gaps caused by fluctuating enrolments. This avoids the risk of long-term permanent hires as student numbers dwindle due to demographic changes, according to a report by Xiong Bingqi, director of the Beijing-based 21st Century Education Research Institute.\\nThis has fuelled anxiety among young people, particularly recent university graduates, in an already challenging job market.\\nYouth unemployment in China has remained at worrying levels in recent years. In August, 18.9 per cent of those aged 16 to 24 – excluding students – were jobless, after a record summer graduation season.\\nThere is a clear financial incentive for localities and schools to hire older teachers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“These teachers already have pensions,” Liang said. “This relieves county governments from financial strains.”\\nInstead of a regular salary, the programme provides an annual average stipend of 20,000 yuan for lecturers at the compulsory education level, split between the central and local governments. County governments are also responsible for providing accommodation.\\nBy contrast, hiring younger workers requires significant employer contributions to social insurance – covering pensions, housing loans and medical insurance – raising costs, especially as Beijing has started to clamp down on businesses that avoid these obligations.\\nYoung college graduates are also often reluctant to relocate to rural areas to teach, Rozelle said. While sending experienced urban teachers to rural schools helps, it only provides a temporary fix since the high turnover rate means localities must continually recruit temporary staff, he added.\\nRozelle argued that a better solution would be to encourage rural households to move to cities and enrol their children in better-resourced urban schools – something that has been very difficult to do until recently.\\n“Many third- and fourth- and fifth-tier cities are now encouraging rural people from their county to come rent or buy an apartment inside the city and send their kids to urban schools,” he said.\\nRecent urbanisation reforms have supported this by relaxing pathways for rural migrants to gain hukou – the residency permit that unlocks access to crucial public services.\\nAnyone moving to cities with fewer than 3 million residents can now qualify for local hukou after just six months of living and working there.\\n",

            "description": "A man in Turkey has agreed to pay his ex-wife 10,000 liras (US$240) every quarter in “cat support”.\\nHis move sets a new precedent for divorces in the pet economy era, which is booming with Turkey’s pet population reaching 20.9 million in 2023.\\nAccording to Turkish media outlet Yenisafak, a couple in Istanbul decided to divorce after two years of marriage due to serious relationship issues.\\nThe man, identified as Bugra, and his former partner, Ezgi, had jointly cared for two cats.\\n\\nIn the divorce settlement, Ezgi was granted custody of the cats, and Bugra agreed to pay her 10,000 liras every three months for the next 10 years to cover their care, including food, vaccinations and other expenses.\\nThe payments, based on a cat’s average 15-year lifespan, will be adjusted annually for inflation and will cease once the pets die.\\nBugra will also pay Ezgi 550,000 liras (US$13,000) in financial compensation.\\nTurkish lawyer Aylin Esra Eren said that pet owners in Turkey typically microchip their pets, making the registered person the pet’s legal guardian.\\nEven if the owners separate, the animals’ health, care and emotional needs must still be met.\\n\\nTurkey’s animal protection law treats pets as “living beings” rather than “property”, meaning abandoning a pet is considered both animal abuse and a legal violation.\\n“Pets that are not properly cared for will become strays, and abandoning microchipped pets on the streets is illegal,” said Eren.\\nPeople who abandon pets in Turkey can be fined up to 60,000 liras (US$1,400).\\nThe lawyer also said that the case has significant implications for divorce trends in the country.\\nShe explained that caring for cats requires attention to their food, mood and health, much like raising a child.\\nThe case is the first to legally define pet care responsibilities, offering legal protection for pets as family members.\\n\\nHowever, Eren said that Bugra’s payments cannot be considered alimony, as under local laws, that can only be requested by a spouse or children.\\nIn Turkey, alimony may be paid to a financially needy spouse after divorce, based on factors like income, marriage length and living standards.\\nThe story has caused a buzz on social media.\\nOne online observer said: “It is great to see growing respect for the status of pets.

            "title": "What Syria’s post-war pivot to China tells us about the new world order",
            "description": "Early this month, Syria’s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani is expected in Beijing for what both sides have billed as a “reset” in relations. The move reflects a wider trend across the Middle East, where governments wary of Western conditionality are increasingly seeking what they view as less encumbered partnerships with China.\\nThe winds of realpolitik are sweeping from the Middle East to Central and South Asia, bringing “hard resets” across entire regions. India’s quiet pivot towards the Taliban and Russia’s renewed rapprochement in Syria and Afghanistan signal a world in flux.\\nWhen Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa took the podium at the 80th United Nations General Assembly in September, it was more than a diplomatic debut; it was the first speech by a Syrian head of state in nearly 60 years.\\nSharaa’s message was direct: Syria wants recognition, investment and the end of sanctions. But his overtures extended beyond the West.\\nForeign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani has made clear that Syria views China as indispensable to its reconstruction\\n\\nIn recent months, Damascus has been looking towards Beijing, dispatching envoys and indicating a broader reorientation of its foreign policy towards the East. China’s strategy of “balanced vagueness” towards Syria suggests that engagement with the new leadership, dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once labelled a terrorist organisation, will be slow and driven by a careful weighing of risks and opportunities.\\nFrom a Syrian standpoint, Shaibani’s priorities in Beijing are straightforward: economic and counterterrorism cooperation. He has made clear that Syria views China as indispensable to its reconstruction, an effort the World Bank estimates will cost US$216 billion.\\nNeighbouring nations are already taking a leading role in Syria’s reconstruction. Saudi Arabia has pledged US$6.4 billion in investments focusing on infrastructure, real estate and information technology. Turkey is spearheading efforts to rebuild power plants, roads and ports, and Qatar has signed a US$7 billion energy deal. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates has moved swiftly with a US$800 million agreement to manage the strategic port of Tartus.\\nEven under former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, Damascus held high hopes for large-scale Chinese investment following reconstruction and trade summits in 2018. At the time, Chinese state-owned enterprises pledged around US$2 billion and bilateral trade reached US$1.3 billion in 2019. However, despite China’s provision of medical supplies during the Covid-19 pandemic, its overall economic engagement fell short of Syrian expectations. A similar pattern may be emerging now.\\n\\nBeijing’s own demands are on the table since Shi Hongwei, China’s ambassador in Damascus, met Sharaa. Syria may rank low on Beijing’s list of Middle Eastern priorities, but the uncertainty radiating from Damascus carries risks that cannot be ignored.\\nThe spectre of terrorist networks exploiting the chaos and the possibility of that threat spilling from the Middle East into Central Asia, China’s near abroad, is stirring unease in Beijing.\\nAt the heart of China’s anxiety lies the presence of Uygur foreign fighters embedded within Syria’s defence apparatus. The newly formed Division 84 is reportedly designed to absorb foreign combatants into the Syrian army and eventually Syrian society – families included. Among them are an estimated 3,500 battle-hardened Uygur fighters from the Turkestan Islamic Party.\\nWhile these forces may not pose an immediate threat to China or Central Asia, their continued presence, and Sharaa’s declared support for a group that spilled blood to assure his victory on the battlefield, have Beijing on edge. It was no coincidence that Chinese envoy Fu Cong recently warned the UN Security Council that foreign terrorist fighters remained active in Syria and urged Damascus to meet its counterterrorism obligations.\\nStill, this month’s diplomatic mission itself marks an important step forward for Syria’s new government, in a moment where symbolism may matter as substance. For Sharaa’s administration, engagement with China offers a pathway to legitimacy and leverage, and a means of signalling that Syria is not entirely beholden to Turkey.\\n\\nFor Beijing, deepening ties with Damascus fits neatly with its long-term strategy to broaden its footprint in the Middle East. At the same time, Chinese diplomats are watching Ankara closely. Turkey has emerged as the new regional kingmaker, wielding growing influence through its early backing of Sharaa, its military presence along Syria’s northern border, and its pledge to train and arm the new Syrian army.\\nAmid simmering tensions between Israel and Iran, a renewed outbreak of violence is a possibility that cannot be ignored. In this volatile context, stability and sustainable development in Syria have become essential, not only to prevent sectarian flare-ups against the country’s minorities but also to contain potential ripple effects that could spread across Iraq and other regions central to China’s energy security.\\nWhether this emerging partnership will lead to meaningful reconstruction remains uncertain. Yet even a fragile regional balance could reopen the door for China’s return, allowing Beijing to move beyond symbolic diplomacy and deploy its preferred foreign policy instrument: investment.\\nOne thing is clear, however. As the old order in the Middle East continues to fracture, Syria’s eastward gaze reflects more than a tactical pivot; it embodies a shifting global balance of power and a quiet acknowledgement that the path back to relevance no longer runs only through Western support.\\nDr Alessandro Arduino is an affiliate lecturer at the Lau China Institute, King’s College London, specialising in the convergence of technological innovation and national security.\\n",
