            "description": "A video showing a one-year-old baby screaming in distress while his parents appeared to tattoo his arm, allegedly to win a free flat worth five million roubles (US$63,000), has sparked global outrage.\\nThe incident stemmed from a challenge launched by 26-year-old Russian influencer Andrey Burim, known online as Mellstroy, who boasts more than 7.6 million followers across social media platforms.\\n\\nstranger to controversy.\\nIn 2020, he sparked public outrage after crossing legal boundaries by physically assaulting a young model during a live-stream.\\nTo promote his online casino business, he launched a challenge inviting anyone online to take part.\\n\\nParticipants can post any type of video content as long as they include a link to his casino.\\nMellstroy and his team would review the videos everyday and select their favourite entry to award a luxury flat worth five million roubles.\\n\\nThe challenge ran from October 17 to November 17, during which 30 flats were given away.\\nTo win the grand prize, some participants have taken the challenge to dangerous extremes.\\n\\nSome people have torn up their passports, shaved their heads, or even tattooed the words “Mellstroy Game” directly onto their faces.\\nShockingly, a 17-year-old girl even set herself on fire.\\n\\nIn one of the most disturbing cases, a woman is seen in a video picking up a tattoo machine, with the help of her husband, and tattooing a long string of letters, “Mellstroy Game” across the arm of a one-year-old toddler.\\nThe woman said: “We decided to join this competition. We have been living in a rental property for three years and simply cannot afford to buy a flat. We are drowning in debt and desperately want to win.”\\n\\n“We did not know how to surprise you, Mellstroy, so we decided to tattoo our one-year-old child,” she added.\\nThe child cried throughout the entire process.\\n\\nThe video triggered public outrage, with netizens condemning their cruelty and demanding a police investigation.\\nAs the backlash intensified, the couple admitted the next day that the act had been staged.\\n\\nAccording to Izvestia, a daily broadsheet newspaper in Russia, the mother clarified that the “tattoo” had actually been drawn with a pen.\\n“We did not tattoo the child.

            "title": "US senators call on Trump to raise Jimmy Lai concerns with Xi in key meeting",
            "description": "A bipartisan group of 38 US senators is urging President Donald Trump to use his expected summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea next week to secure the release of former Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, the latest in the US Congress’s efforts to get human rights on the agenda of the high-stakes meeting.\\nIn a letter released on Friday, the lawmakers described Lai as a political prisoner and said the case for his release was “more dire than ever” due to his worsening health.\\n“At 78 years old, he is in poor and deteriorating health. He is a diabetic and suffers from numerous physical ailments that are compounded by his continuing incarceration,” they wrote.\\n“Mr Lai’s representatives have assured us that if he is released, he will leave Hong Kong and never return. He would have no desire to remain in public life. Should he die in prison, on the other hand, he would become a martyr; a powerful and enduring symbol of opposition.”\\nThe letter sent to Trump, dated October 23, was led by two Republicans, Rick Scott of Florida, and James Risch, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\\nLai is currently awaiting a verdict after a marathon national security trial in Hong Kong that concluded earlier this year.\\n\\nThe businessman-turned-opposition activist, who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily tabloid, is the most prominent figure yet to be prosecuted under the Beijing-decreed national security law.\\nUS and other Western politicians have repeatedly condemned his prosecution as an attack on press freedom and demanded his release.\\nHong Kong authorities have dismissed such accusations as attempts to undermine the city’s rule of law.\\nResponding to the letter on Friday, the Chinese embassy in Washington reiterated this.\\n“Hong Kong upholds the rule of law. To abide by the law and bring lawbreakers to justice is a basic principle,” said spokesperson Liu Pengyu.\\n“Jimmy Lai is the principal mastermind and perpetrator behind the series of riots that shook Hong Kong. He is an agent and henchman of those hostile to China.”\\nTrump earlier this year said he would seek to do what he could to “save” Lai, echoing a pledge from the presidential campaign trail last year.\\nThe US president is expected to meet Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea next Thursday local time, as part of a stabilising effort after a recent escalation in tensions.\\n\\n\\nRelations between the US and China hit new lows in recent weeks, after Beijing announced on October 9 that it would roll out further export restrictions on rare earth elements, key raw materials used in hi-tech manufacturing, in what many saw as a response to the expansion of a US trade blacklist.\\nTrump responded to Beijing’s announcement by threatening to impose an additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods – which he later conceded was “not sustainable” – and introduce export controls on all “critical software”.\\nMore complications arose when two countries began implementing new port fee structures on each other’s ships, and Trump warned he was considering a halt to purchases of Chinese cooking oil.\\nPressure on China ahead of major events has sometimes yielded results. In 2000, post-arrest publicity helped to release Dickinson College librarian Song Yongyi, then a US permanent resident, when Beijing needed US Congressional approval to join the World Trade Organisation.\\nAlso this week, a similar letter was sent to the US president by a group of Republican lawmakers asking him to press Xi for the release of Americans imprisoned or under exit bans in China.\\nTrump said earlier this week that he was seeking a deal with Xi on “everything”.\\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong has set course to join the ‘yacht club of Asia’, can it find way?",
            "description": "On a recent weekend, the members-only Lantau Yacht Club in Hong Kong hosted a high-profile boat show, with Rolls-Royce limousines, luxury Jacob &amp; Co timepieces, drones and live music all part of the package to tempt well-heeled guests.\\nThe privately owned yacht club, in Lantau’s Island’s resort-like Discovery Bay neighbourhood, was a pioneer in reconfiguring operations to target high-end superyachts in 2020 and has 148 wet berths and associated facilities.\\nFranklin Mak, executive vice-president of hospitality at HKR International, the developer behind the club, estimated that one large visiting yacht could generate a daily six-figure sum in economic activity through spending by guests and crew on shore.\\n“Actually, for one [large] boat, there is an average of tens of thousands of dollars, over HK$100,000, in business effect per day,” Mak said. “The numbers are impressive.”\\nIt is not just private operators that are eyeing the financial benefits of the yacht economy – potentially worth billions of dollars annually – the government is also aiming to go full steam ahead with an ambitious plan to catapult Hong Kong into the “yacht club of Asia”.\\nBut challenges remain in public access, facilities, skilled workforce shortages and bureaucratic coordination. With industry players calling for a fundamental policy shift to fully unlock Hong Kong’s yacht tourism potential and create a seamless experience that rivals established Asian hubs, how can the city set a course for success?\\nCity leader John Lee Ka-chiu made waves recently by unveiling some yacht tourism measures during his latest policy blueprint to capitalise on Hong Kong’s natural assets of 1,180km (733.2 miles) of coastline and 263 islands.\\nThe Post has learned that more initiatives are on the way to fast track development following the government’s plan to create 1,100 berths, including 500 at the airport that can accommodate 80-metre superyachts.\\nIn his annual policy address last month, the chief executive pledged to ease the requirements for visiting yachts, allowing them to anchor in designated government waters, and to mandate mainland Chinese organisations to conduct exams for local yacht masters to help visiting crew and captains obtain qualifications for sailing in Hong Kong.\\nThe measures aim to allow cross-border yachting in what Lee called an “individual travel scheme” for yachts, both northbound or southbound. These measures would ultimately be extended to visiting yachts from overseas, Lee promised.\\nTransport minister Mable Chan recently underlined the importance of the initiative: “I do agree that the yacht economy will bring a lot of economic benefits to Hong Kong. We have rich marine resources. We have a magnificent base in Hong Kong. The current-term government is goal-oriented. Different policy bureaus will work together for synergy.”\\n\\nHow big is the market?\\nThe Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA), a political party, estimated in a recent report that a successful yacht industry could inject HK$4.5 billion into the city’s economy annually – HK$3 billion from services such as maintenance, berthing and chartering, and HK$1.5 billion from boat sales.\\nThe city already boasts a large local fleet, with around 12,000 Class IV vessels – or pleasure boats – registered as of the end of October 2024, with the number having grown steadily by about 300 per year.\\nAccording to a government reply to a lawmaker’s question last November, 58 non-locally registered vessels visited Hong Kong for leisure last year as of October, 27.5 per cent lower than in 2023. The number of overseas vessels and passengers visiting the city between 2021 and 2023 grew continuously, the statistics showed.\\nThe Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club pointed to intense pressure on facilities in the city, adding that mooring capacity was “entirely saturated, with waiting lists demonstrating years of pent-up local demand”.\\nIt also highlighted the massive economic potential being missed, estimating that a fully developed sector could contribute “hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the local economy”.\\nA thriving yacht sector also creates a “halo effect”, driving demand in adjacent luxury industries such as high-end retail, hospitality, wellness and fine dining, and catering to an affluent clientele seeking exclusive experiences, according to trend forecasting firm WGSN.\\nHong Kong’s US$27 billion wellness economy provides fertile ground for positioning yachting within this lucrative market.\\nOlivier Besson, founder and chief executive of yacht dealer and brokerage firm Asia Yachting, said the primary economic potential spanned the entire ownership cycle.\\n“The real value of the ‘yacht economy’ lies not only in new yacht sales but across the entire ownership cycle – berthing, operations, aftersales and management,” Besson said.\\nOther components of the industry chain include insurance, legal and professional services, repair and maintenance, and the hospitality sector.\\nFor example, a visiting yacht is required to possess a valid third-party risks insurance policy of not less than HK$5 million coverage for operating a vessel within Hong Kong waters. Third-party risks and other yacht-related insurance products that comply with the law are available in the market.\\n\\nPlain sailing elsewhere?\\nSome industry leaders and sailors said the policy address laid down the groundwork, but more had to be done to materialise its ambitions. A lack of public access and facilities had created a polarised market, they said.\\nCanadian-Hong Kong writer and yachtsman Cameron Dueck, 51, described the local scene as “very club-based”, limiting its appeal compared with places such as Japan with well-run public marinas.\\nDueck, who left the city in October 2023 and has since sailed extensively in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea on his 42-foot yacht, contrasted Hong Kong’s exclusivity with the accessibility he found elsewhere.\\n“We’re in Japan at the moment, and it has a great network of marinas, some of which are club based, but many are run as public facilities,” Dueck said.\\n“They are not as fancy or prestigious as a private club may be, but they’re simple, well-run facilities that make boating more accessible to the general public.”\\nHe said Japan had also taken the innovative step of opening its fishing ports to yachts for short stays, a move that “greatly enhanced its appeal as a cruising destination”.\\nThis pragmatic approach, Dueck said, offered a model Hong Kong could emulate by better utilising its existing typhoon shelters, rather than focusing solely on building new high-end facilities.\\nFor yacht owners such as himself, the costs and hassles in Hong Kong were significant, he said.\\nDueck said a rule of thumb was that annual maintenance costs were roughly 10 per cent of a yacht’s value, on top of Hong Kong’s high mooring fees.\\nTo ensure they have supporting facilities, most yacht owners are attached to private clubs such as the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, the Aberdeen Marina Club, the Aberdeen Boat Club, the Gold Coast Yacht and Country Club and others.\\nJack Wong, chairman of the Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, pointed to the economic benefit of sports development, noting his club supported “competitive sailing by hosting prestigious international regattas”.\\nHe said these events, like a recent championship for more than 200 junior sailors, generated “considerable spending on accommodation, dining, transport and leisure”, positively affecting the local tourism sector.\\nWhile the government plans new berths, industry leaders consistently pointed to a dearth of convenient landing spots, reliable water and power supplies, and proper waste disposal facilities as the critical “missing link” preventing growth.\\nLawrence Chow, chairman of the Hong Kong Boating Industry Association, said that five newly proposed free-anchorage zones – including in Stanley Bay and Tai Tam Bay – were a great start and initiative. But they would be of limited use without basic amenities like floating pontoons nearby.\\n“Visitors still need a way to get off their boat to go ashore,” Chow said, adding that without nearby landing points, the new anchorage zones would be very difficult for visitors to use”.\\nHe suggested that the immediate priority should be “developing pontoons at various locations to allow people with yachts and dinghies to temporarily berth alongside and go ashore”.\\nIf visiting vessels must return to the same anchorage points when cruising, then there should be more designated anchorage points; otherwise, cruising for visiting yachts would still be quite restrictive, Chow added.\\nBill Lau, founder of yacht services platform Holimood, pointed to poor user experience at many public piers compared with private yacht clubs, noting issues with safety, accessibility and a lack of facilities including power on shore.\\n\\nHe contrasted this with Sanya on Hainan Island and Phuket in Thailand, where dedicated tourist centres and proper infrastructure supported the yacht charter industry.\\n“[Tourists] gather at a visitor centre to board, perhaps with [food and drinks], watersports equipment and other add-on services – the whole experience is very different,” Lau said.\\nBut in Hong Kong, “waiting to board at Central or Tsim Sha Tsui piers in the hot weather – you can see during peak hours you might wait for an hour because too many boats are coming and going”, he said.\\n“How can the experience be good in the heat? But these basic things haven’t been done – that’s the infrastructure side.”\\nHe argued that Hong Kong’s real, immediate potential lay in packaging its existing charter fleet and accessible cruising grounds into attractive short-term tourism products, a segment currently underdeveloped and poorly marketed.\\nNew blood needed\\nMultiple industry insiders, including Mak, Besson and Andrew Chan, director of sales and marketing from parts supplier Ronsil Development, highlighted a severe shortage of skilled marine engineers and technicians, especially certified marine electricians, compounded by an ageing workforce.\\n“Current mechanics may not have enough or updated knowledge to catch up with the new technology and requirement,” said Chan, who is also deputy chairman of the Hong Kong Boating Industry Association, adding that specialised knowledge was required for marine systems and modern electronic engines.\\nSimon Chan, boss of brokerage Wah Hing (China) Marine, put it bluntly: “Which mother would let her son go and work on boats?” Even those without academic qualifications preferred not to do such hard work, he added.\\nBesson said this deficit in maintenance, repair and overhaul services directly affected Hong Kong’s superyacht ambitions.\\nWhile the Marine Department said local shipyards could service vessels over 100 metres, industry players disagreed on the quality and availability.\\nMak noted long waiting lists for repairs, sometimes up to three months.\\n\\nChan said many Hong Kong superyachts were sailed to the Philippines or Thailand for major work.\\nHe said Zhuhai’s Jinwan district, with its lower costs and growing shipyard capacity, was poised to capture the lucrative market as cross-border travel eases.\\nHoward Chen, chief executive of Zhuhai-based Selene Yachts, said Jinwan aimed to offer world-class maintenance, repairs and overhaul services at labour costs less than half of Hong Kong’s.\\n“In terms of speed, one side [Hong Kong] needs three or four months; over here [in Jinwan], we can fix it in three or four days, three or four weeks,” Chen said. “In terms of price, wages are cheaper by half … you save at least 30 per cent or more.”\\nWhile a Hong Kong government task force is working with Guangdong counterparts to ease cross-border procedures for yachts, the reality remains difficult.\\nWilson Lam, sales manager of Wah Hing (China) Marine, said the application process for taking a boat across the border could take one to two months, compared with days for vehicle permits, killing any spontaneity.\\nAt present, visiting pleasure vessels including those from the mainland entering Hong Kong waters are required to complete port formalities with the Marine Department, the Immigration Department, the Department of Health and the Customs and Excise Department.\\nIf a vessel intends to cruise into Hong Kong waters for leisure purposes, conduct repairs, participate in a racing event or change its berthing location, it must file an application to the Marine Office for permission.\\n\\nDueck said true cruising freedom required the ability to explore multiple ports after a single entry clearance, which was currently impossible in the Greater Bay Area.\\n“Currently, it is too much hassle for most individual Hong Kong yachts to even sail to Macau for the weekend, unless they are taking part in an organised event,” Dueck said.\\nResolving these interconnected challenges required a fundamental shift in governance and specific policy reforms, critics and industry players said.\\nPaul Zimmerman, honorary president of the association and an urban planning advocate, said a single government body with the budget, authority and mandate to manage the entire marine recreation ecosystem was needed, breaking the current fragmented approach where responsibility was split ineffectively between the Marine Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Development Bureau and others.\\nBPA legislator Benson Luk Hon-man, an advocate for the yacht industry, urged the government to establish a high-level task force, potentially led by a deputy secretary in the government, to cut across bureaucratic silos and drive the multifaceted initiative forward.\\n“The yacht economy encompasses multiple policy areas, so the government needs to consider coordination comprehensively,” Luk said.\\n“To this end, I propose establishing a high-level task force led by deputy secretaries of departments to coordinate and drive the relevant policy bureaus, accelerating the implementation of measures to develop the yacht economy.”\\nSuch a body, proponents argued, was essential given the policy spanned the remits of transport, tourism, development, marine and immigration authorities.\\nTangible changes were needed to make Hong Kong more competitive and user-friendly, industry players said.\\nA top priority, Besson said, was to align local regulations – covering yacht registration, licensing and navigation rights – with international standards. This was crucial to making it easier for foreign-flagged yachts to visit or base themselves in the city, he added.\\nFranklin Mak of the Lantau Yacht Club strongly advocated for streamlining immigration and customs procedures through digital systems, drawing parallels with Hong Kong’s efficient airport clearance, and suggested exploring licence reciprocity to simplify crew requirements.\\nThe Marine Department highlighted its planned upgrades to the electronic business system for one-stop clearance and the authorisation of mainland bodies to conduct local licence exams.\\nIndustry players said the scale of the task was immense, requiring coordination across borders and departments, significant investment in both hardware and software, and a long-term commitment to nurturing talent and protecting the environment.\\nParadoxically, the path to a high-end yacht economy could lie in providing support for growing the grass roots who enjoyed boating and watersports, Zimmerman argued.\\n“So if you want to attract the big boats, you should focus on the economy of the small boats … make sure that that economy works, so that you have a large group of people who know the water.”\\n",

            "description": "The daughter of prominent Hong Kong businessman Peter Law Kin-sang has bought a luxury flat in Mid-Levels West following his sale of a Peak mansion in the city’s most expensive property transaction this year.\\nWinnie Law Wing-yin acquired a 4,710 sq ft (438 square metres) flat in tower two, phase one of The Legacy for HK$355 million (US$45.7 million), according to Land Registry records. The transaction was completed on Tuesday.\\nThe luxury project at 8 Castle Road was jointly developed by Henderson Land Development and New World Development and opened for sales in September.\\nIt features 172 flats, including a three-storey penthouse spanning over 12,000 sq ft – the largest new flat on offer in Hong Kong since 2013.

            "title": "Was Russian jet fly-past a bid to intimidate Japan into cooling ties with US?",
            "description": "A near-incursion of Russian fighter jets into Japanese airspace last week was a bid by Moscow to intimidate Tokyo amid strengthening ties with Washington, observers warned.\\nAnd unless there was a breakthrough in US-Russia relations, it was unlikely that ties between Moscow and Tokyo would thaw even under new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, they said.\\nJapan said it scrambled jets last Friday to monitor Russian warplanes, including strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, which had flown along the edge of Japanese airspace up its coast.\\nRussia’s Defence Ministry, in a statement reported by state-owned RIA news agency, confirmed its Tu-95 bombers had been escorted by jets from another country during what it described as a routine patrol flight over neutral waters.\\nThe incident was said to have taken place hours before Takaichi pledged to accelerate Japan’s defence build-up. In her first speech to parliament since taking office, she said Russia’s military activities, along with those of China and North Korea, were posing a “serious concern”.\\n\\nJapan’s Ministry of Defence released a map showing the flight path of the Russian planes off Japan’s west coast over the Sea of Japan. It said the bombers were accompanied by two Su-35 fighters and had initially flown towards Japan’s Sado Island before turning northwards.\\n“Russia conducts daily military operations around our country while invading Ukraine – this is the reality,” new Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi wrote in a social media post.\\nYoichiro Sato, a professor of Asia-Pacific studies at Japan’s Ritsumeikan Asia-Pacific University, said while Moscow had previously flown bombers around Japan’s airspace, the timing of last week’s manoeuvre was notable, coming just after Takaichi took office and before she was due to meet US President Donald Trump.\\nRussia is trying to intimidate Japan against enhancing its alliance with the US\\nYoichiro Sato, a professor of Asia-Pacific studies\\n“[This] suggests Russia is trying to intimidate Japan against enhancing its alliance with the US,” Sato said. “This is likely counterproductive, as the domestic public opinion will support stronger defence that Takaichi pursues.”\\nDuring Takaichi’s first summit with Trump on Tuesday, both sides agreed to strengthen the bilateral alliance’s deterrence and response capabilities.\\nTokyo also made clear it would take the initiative in shoring up defence spending.\\nPublic support for increased defence spending in Japan has grown in recent years. A Yomiuri Shimbun poll in April found that 53 per cent of respondents supported the government’s military budget increase.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Koizumi told his visiting US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that Japan would raise its defence budget to 2 per cent of its gross domestic product by the end of this financial year, two years ahead of its previous commitment.\\nColder than Abe?\\nAlthough Takaichi was a protege to late Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, Sato said she was unlikely to continue with her mentor’s “flirtation” with Russia.\\n“The hardline [position] against Russia, which resulted in Japan’s joining of the western sanctions against Russia during the Fumio Kishida administration, is likely to be maintained by Takaichi,” Sato said.\\nAbe and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met more than two dozen times over the course of the former’s second term as prime minister, from 2012 to 2020.\\nApart from inviting Putin to his hometown of Nagato and attending the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 amid western leaders’ boycott, Abe also boosted economic ties with Moscow, especially in the Russian Far East.\\n\\n\\nAbe also continued negotiations with Moscow on the disputed islands known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kurils in Russia.\\nArtyom Lukin, a professor at Russia’s Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, said Takaichi’s leadership was unlikely to significantly alter Russia-Japan ties.\\n“Political relations between Japan and Russia have already been virtually frozen under the previous prime ministers … Neither Japan nor Russia see each other as foreign policy priorities. It will not change under Takaichi,” Lukin said.\\nTokyo’s behaviour towards Moscow would also depend on the state of relations between the US and Russia, he added. “If Trump makes a deal with Putin, Japan-Russia relations are likely to improve as well. If US-Russia relations deteriorate, Tokyo will follow suit.”\\nTies between Washington and Moscow remain largely adversarial, driven by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, with the US implementing a new round of sanctions targeting Russian oil on October 22.\\nFollowing a phone call with Putin on October 16, Trump announced his intention to meet the Russian leader in Budapest within two weeks to discuss ending the war. But days later, on October 22, Trump called off the planned summit, stating that he did not want a “wasted meeting” or a “waste of time”.\\n\\nLukin said that an important thing to watch was whether the Takaichi government would drastically reduce, or even stop, purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas from Sakhalin.\\n“If it happens, then, the last major economic link between Russia and Japan will be severed. It is not likely to happen in the short term, though,” Lukin predicted.\\nWashington has been urging Tokyo to end Russian energy imports to reinforce sanctions on Moscow over its war against Ukraine that began in 2022.\\nOn Tuesday, Takaichi told Trump that Japan intended to keep importing Russian gas for the time being, warning of the risk of domestic power shortages if imports were stopped, the Japanese media reported, citing government sources.\\nLast year, Russia accounted for 8.6 per cent of Japan’s total imports of liquefied natural gas, which is mainly used for thermal power generation and city gas.\\nThe gas comes from the Sakhalin 2 in the Russian Far East. Two Japanese firms continue to hold stakes in the energy project even after British oil giant Shell withdrew following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nIndia, “intimidated” by Trump’s tariff, was expected to stop new Russian oil purchases and turn to alternative supplies from the Middle East, Sato said. “Japan is not off the hook either.”\\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\\n",

I’ve had some really good regattas and also some not-so-good ones so, next season, I want to be a bit more consistent up there, consistency is really important in sailing.”\\n\\nFirst though, the 26-year-old said he planned to take a break before heading to Greece for a training camp in the middle of November.\\n“I haven’t even thought about where I’m going to go,” he said. “But it’ll probably be really spontaneous and go somewhere outside [of Hong Kong].”\\nThe city’s first medal of any colour at the 2025 Games brought with it a HK$750,000 (US$96,500) bonus as part of the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s incentive scheme for athletes.\\nAsked what he might do with the money, Halliday said he was “not sure”, but maybe fans would “see me at the racecourse next Wednesday, betting on a horse”.\\n“So, let’s see what happens,” he said. “Put it all on red, you know, then maybe I can buy a big boat.”\\nHalliday had not really considered the possibility he might win gold until teammate Peter Jessop said it was sure to happen, and the two-time Asian Games athlete thanked his compatriot for “having a lot of faith in me”.\\n“I wasn’t 100 per cent confident but I knew that if I had a bad race I could catch up, and I think that’s what got me the gold medal in the end,” Halliday said. “I was waiting for them to make the mistakes, and I was just consistently up there.\\n“And eventually some of them did make a big mistake, and I took the win from there.”\\nSenior officials at the Sailing Federation of Hong Kong, China said Halliday’s dedication had been key to his success and believed the confidence he would take from winning would only help him going forwards.\\nPeter Backe, the federation’s vice-president, said Halliday needed to take that confidence as “one of the better sailors in the world now” and turn it into “becoming the absolute top sailor”.\\n“It shouldn’t be a surprise to him to rank in the top three at any of the events around the world now,” Backe said. “Sailing is a very unpredictable sport because there’s so many factors. I don’t want to say too many things about the results but he should easily be fighting for a medal at the Asian Games.”\\n",

            "title": "Washington Halloween displays show scariest thing for Democrats is Trump",
            "description": "In some neighbourhoods of heavily Democratic Washington, Halloween displays with a decidedly political tone have long been a tradition.\\nNine months into Republican US President Donald Trump’s second term, some residents are staging anti-Trump yard displays prompted in part by his administration’s budget cuts, job lay-offs and norm-breaking policies.\\nThis Halloween also coincides with one of the longest government shutdowns in US history.\\nIn a front yard close to the US Capitol, Donna Breslin, 79, has installed an entire graveyard with 16 headstones to mark policy moves Trump has made since he took office in January that she says are killing off American democracy.\\nThere are headstones – bought on Amazon and hand-painted by Breslin – for “USAID” and “research for health and science”, among others.\\n\\nThe headstones are references to Trump administration cuts to the US Agency for International Development and health research, both part of his broader effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.\\nReuters journalists visited two neighbourhoods in Washington – Georgetown and Capitol Hill, known for their politically themed displays – over two days and did not find any pro-Trump or anti-Democratic Halloween decorations.\\nThe Washington metropolitan area has borne the brunt of Trump’s cuts. Civil servants have been furloughed because of the shutdown with each party blaming the other.\\nIn the city proper, around 90 per cent of voters are registered Democrats.\\nTrump defends the cuts as necessary to reduce a bloated and inefficient workforce. He rejects the notion that his actions test the limits of the presidency and undermine democracy, saying he is simply delivering on his campaign agenda.\\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Democrats were engaged in “pointless virtue signalling” with their anti-Trump Halloween displays.\\n\\nThe White House is also using Halloween to mock its opponents, posting images on social media of costumes depicting Democratic leaders – and a separate one of Trump himself with the message, “Not included – crown.”\\nThis would appear to be a White House effort to make light of the “No Kings” protests by tens of thousands of Americans this month to oppose what they view as authoritarian tendencies in Trump’s leadership.\\nOne focus of this year’s Halloween displays is Trump’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jnr, who has cut staff at the Department of Health and Human Services and promoted debunked claims that routine childhood vaccines cause harm.\\nIn the wealthy, liberal Northwest Washington neighbourhood of Georgetown, where Kennedy lives, there are multiple skeletons on display in front yards alongside vaccine-related messages.\\nA block from Kennedy’s house stands a giant three-metre-tall (10-foot -tall) skeleton next to a sign that reads, “Hi, I’m Wally! Vaccines save lives – believe me I know!”\\n\\nKennedy has restricted access to Covid-19 shots, boosted support for state vaccine exemptions, dismantled the vaccine review process, and expanded a national advisory board with like-minded critics of Covid shots.\\nAn HHS spokesman said in a statement, “Let’s be clear: Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine – he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability. His long-standing advocacy has focused on ensuring that vaccines and all medical interventions meet the highest standards of safety and are backed by gold standard science.”\\nIn another Georgetown front yard, a skeleton dangles over a fence with a stethoscope around its neck, next to a sign reading, “Secretary of Sick”.\\nClose to Kennedy’s house, Christine Payne, 66, has placed a child-sized skeleton in her front window with the message, “Wish I had taken my vaccine!”\\nPayne said while she didn’t agree with his policies, Kennedy was a good neighbour.\\n“I think we all need to speak out with what’s going on in this nation at the moment, especially in Washington,” Payne said. “We’re very political here.”\\n",

            "title": "European private equity firm Ardian eyes fresh growth at new office in Hong Kong’s Two IFC",
            "description": "Paris-based private equity (PE) firm Ardian has opened a 4,000 sq ft office in Hong Kong’s main business district, with an eye on growing its US$3 billion investment out of the company’s total US$200 billion in assets under management (AUM).\\nThe new office at the Two International Finance Centre in Central marked the company’s fifth location in Asia and would initially have eight permanent staff, according to Jason Yao, the group’s head of Greater China.\\n“The reason we have an office here is to be close to our investors,” Yao said in an interview with the Post on Thursday. “We have very important insurance companies that have already committed to our various products. To be close to clients is one thing we want to develop in Hong Kong.”\\n“Private wealth is also a big topic in our industry as a source of capital. Investment-wise it is very important for the secondary business,” Yao added. “So we have a lot of sellers here and we have most of the intermediaries, the investment bank side, also here. It’s also very critical for us to further expand our secondary business in the region.”\\nArdian, one of the largest European-headquartered PE firms, is considered one of the leading investors in the secondary private market, which involves the buying and selling of existing investments from other investors.\\nIt has about 50 long-standing clients in the Greater China region. Its investors include insurance firms, sovereign wealth funds, private wealth investors and endowments.\\nThe company’s expansion reflected robust growth in Hong Kong’s private banking and wealth management sectors, as well as an evolving office property market that is contending with slower demand amid plenty of new completed prime office buildings.\\nMajor private banks’ AUM in Hong Kong rose 14 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the end of December, while they hired more than 400 wealth management experts in the past two years, an increase of 12 per cent, according to Eddie Yue Wai-man, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Some of these banks also expanded their office space.\\n\\nMeanwhile, 17.1 per cent of the city’s prime offices were empty as of the third quarter, according to data compiled by consultancy CBRE. The number of empty offices is likely to hit a record 19 per cent by the end of the year.\\nThat development comes as the banking and finance sector further reduced its office footprint in Hong Kong by 70,000 sq ft of net floor area between 2022 and 2025, following a significant 680,000 sq ft contraction in the preceding three years, CBRE said.\\nFirms from the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa reduced their total footprint by 1.3 million sq ft from 2022 to 2025, which was a smaller decline than the 2.7 million sq ft drop seen from 2019 to 2022, the consultancy added.\\nOn a positive development, the Hong Kong stock market has topped the global rankings for initial public offerings, as 66 companies raised US$23.27 billion on the main board in the first nine months of this year.\\nIn addition, the government has remained aggressive in attracting affluent investors in the city via its cash-for-residency scheme.\\nBefore the opening of Ardian’s new office in Central, Yao said the company would serve Hong Kong-based clients from its Beijing office.\\n“It makes more sense to be based here instead of flying in and out of Hong Kong every week,” he said, adding that Ardian planned to hire seven new recruits by next year.\\nIt also helped that office rental prices in Hong Kong have fallen as the group committed to a long-term lease for its space in Central.\\n“The rent is much better than we expected,” he said. “We’re very lucky as we signed last November and I consider that timing to probably be the bottom of the market.”\\nThere was a lot of potential for Ardian to grow investments from Hong Kong-based clients, even doubling them by next year, he said.\\nArdian considered establishing an office in Hong Kong even before the Covid-19 pandemic, but had to defer the plan owing to social distancing measures and the search for a suitable space.\\n“Hong Kong’s Central is unparalleled,” he said. “Nowhere else can you find in such a small [central business] area, where you have all your peers, all the investment banks, all the lawyers, all very concentrated in one super efficient location.”\\n“We also like the (Victoria Harbour) view.”\\nAs for some companies, either downsizing operations in Hong Kong or leaving the city, Yao said these cases typically made a lot of noise. Ardian, however, viewed them as a “natural transition”, he added.\\n“You always have people coming and going,” he said. “As a European firm, we always watch out for opportunities in Hong Kong. We are committed and we want to be here in the next 20 to 30 years.”\\n",

            "title": "Can ancient monastery in Mount Sinai, Egypt, cope with massive increase in tourism?",
            "description": "St Catherine’s Monastery, located at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt and known for its sacred peace, is now preparing to open up to the public.\\nThe Greek Orthodox monastery was founded in the 6th century and is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited Christian monasteries.\\nMoses is said to have received the 10 Commandments on Mount Sinai.\\nThis 1,500-year-old monastery was built where the valley ends and Mount Sinai begins.\\nKnown among the faithful for housing relics of St Catherine of Alexandria, its ancient library of rare manuscripts also draws many pilgrims.\\nGentle breezes blow across barren, reddish-brown rocks, causing rose bushes and olive trees to flutter.\\n\\nSpend a few days here, and what you mostly sense is silence.\\nChristians, Jews and Muslims revere this place, where faith, history and nature all come together in a powerful combination.\\nBut down in the valley, it is bustling with concrete, containers and construction vehicles as today’s Egypt prepares for tomorrow’s tourism.\\nHotels and villas are planned, offering upwards of 1,000 rooms plus a promenade with a bazaar, a Peace Plaza and a visitor centre. The sign is already in place.\\nThe government is celebrating the construction project, which is scheduled for completion in October 2026, as “Egypt’s gift to the whole world and all religions”.\\nA museum and theatre are planned, as well as conference rooms and restaurants. Motorways are being paved and a currently unused airport nearby is being expanded. It is set to cost US$220 million.\\nIt will be a “wonderful destination for all visitors”, whether they come for religious reasons, recreation or nature, says Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly.\\nAccording to state-affiliated media, the aim is to “harness the magic of the region” and transform it into a “must-visit destination”. A large German hotel chain is already on board.\\n\\nBut can a monastery that thrives on peace and seclusion cope with so many visitors? Will not a religious site with a few occasional tourists then become a tourist site with a few religious attractions?\\nA “delicate balance” is needed, says Father Justin, one of 22 monks living in St Catherine’s Monastery. “Open and accessible to a certain extent, but also preserving quiet times and solitude.”\\nThe monks begin their day at 4am and live in line with a “complex schedule that has been in place for centuries”, Father Justin says. The monastery opens to visitors for three hours a day at present. But change is coming. The project represents “the greatest possible contrast to what the area stands for”, according to World Heritage Watch, an organisation dedicated to protecting Unesco World Heritage sites. The area received this status in 2002.\\nUnesco has called on the government in Cairo to present a protection plan, halt the construction work and let observers into the country, but so far, nothing has come of this.\\nThe Bedouin have long been faced with a new reality. Members of the Jabaliya tribe, said to be descended from Byzantine soldiers sent in the 6th century to guard the monastery, are believed to be the oldest tribe in the area. The name “Jabaliya” comes from the Arabic word for “mountain”.\\nThey made the construction and operation of the monastery possible in the first place, acting as protectors, mountain guides and camel drivers. Now, their houses have been demolished during the construction work, and an old cemetery has been destroyed. With their bare hands, they dug up the remains of their relatives to bury them further away. Where the cemetery used to be is now a car park.\\n“They ignore everyone,” says one of the Bedouin of the government’s activities.\\nSt Catherine’s Monastery is in danger of becoming like Sharm el-Sheikh, further south – a place with “five-star hotels and tourists who only stay in their hotels”.\\n\\nAfter being forced into the hinterland in Sharm, many Bedouin make their living from waste recycling.\\nOn Mount Sinai, everything appears to be the same as ever. For some, after a laborious climb, all the energy of St Catherine is released.\\nA Korean tour group is singing Christian songs, and a woman sobs loudly as she says a prayer at the summit. Another sits quietly crying on a rock, watching the sunset.\\nDown in the monastery, the singing of the monks can be heard coming from a loudspeaker in the small shop, and the smell of burning wax from the votive candles fills the air.\\nA few rooms above, the library houses more than 3,300 ancient manuscripts.\\n“You have to protect the people who come here to feel something inside themselves,” says a monk. “Something in their hearts. If you don’t protect it, it becomes a tourist attraction,” he says, placing both hands on his chest.\\n",

            "title": "For Hong Kong’s fiscal health, commercial land sales should resume",
            "description": "The sluggish property market has made government land sales more difficult. With the economy still volatile and public confidence fragile, developers and homebuyers are understandably cautious when making investment decisions. Officials should monitor market sentiment closely and adjust relevant policies accordingly in a prudent and timely manner. If the latest residential property prices are any reference, the market has apparently bottomed out.\\nData from the Rating and Valuation Department shows that lived-in home prices rose 1.3 per cent in September, logging the biggest gains so far this year and reaching the highest in more than a year. The increase marks the sixth consecutive month in which the official index has either remained stable or edged higher. Similarly, the Land Registry recorded 78 first-hand residential sales priced between HK$30 million (US$3.86 million) and HK$49.99 million in the first 20 days of October, a 10-month high in transactions involving upmarket deals.\\nConsidering residential prices had fallen 28.4 per cent as of March this year, from their peak in September 2021, the rebound came as a much-needed boost in confidence. The upturn was mainly attributed to a favourable view of easing in interest rates and a resurgence in the recent performance of the local stock market. But whether the optimism is spilling over to the commercial market and the wider economy remains to be seen.\\nSecretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho said it was likely that commercial land sales would be suspended for the second year because of a lack of market demand. This followed a moratorium early this year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply. The minister said supply remained abundant, adding that the government would not earn any land premium if tenders failed amid a lukewarm market response.\\nThat may be true, but the government cannot sit back until the property market has fully recovered. With so many massive development projects in the pipeline, the government must stay ahead of the market and adjust its policies so as to facilitate timely business decisions. This is not only in the interest of the market but also for the sake of land revenues and public fiscal health.\\n",
