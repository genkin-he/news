            "description": "Brazil’s soybean producers are downplaying concerns over a freshly minted US-China trade agreement that will see Beijing resume large-scale purchases of American soybeans, insisting the 12 million tonnes (13.23 million tons) pledged represents routine seasonal trade rather than a market upheaval.\\nMauricio Buffon, president of Brazil’s Soybean Producers Association (Aprosoja), said the volume announced by Washington and Beijing on Wednesday should not alarm Brazilian exporters, framing it as part of normal supply cycles.\\n“It is a movement that happens every year,” Buffon said in an interview to CNN Money Brazil.\\n“The United States has soybeans available now because they have just harvested. Brazil, on the other hand, is planting the new crop and has low stocks.”\\nThe accord, unveiled after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in South Korea marks a potential turning point for American farmers battered by months of suspended Chinese orders.\\n\\n\\nUnder the deal, China would immediately resume agricultural purchases whilst also reducing certain trade barriers and import tariffs.\\nTrump hailed the agreement as a win for US farmers and global market stability.\\nBut for Brazil, which sends roughly three-quarters of its soybean exports to China, worth nearly $44 billion last year, the rapprochement has sparked both wariness and calculation.\\nStill, Buffon suggested stronger US sales could actually lift prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, indirectly helping Brazilian growers.\\n“The market will oscillate a lot over the next 60 days,” he said. “Producers need to stay alert and take advantage of good commercial opportunities.”\\nYet he warned of serious domestic headwinds. Buffon characterised the 2025-26 planting season as “a crop without money”, citing delayed federal credit and stalled government farm support. As of mid-October, more than half the funding for Brazil’s main agricultural credit programme hadn’t reached producers.\\n“Without investment in fertilisers and soil correction, we risk an average crop,” Buffon said, adding that tight credit and dry weather could crimp output in major producing states like Mato Grosso and Parana.\\nWeaker production would strain Brazil’s trade balance and potentially drive up domestic food prices, he said, pointing to recent spikes in rice and bean costs.\\nAnalysts across South America are weighing the deal’s ramifications. In Argentina, grain analyst Eugenio Irazuegui of brokerage Zeni told La Nacion that whilst soybean futures continued climbing globally, premiums for South American cargoes had begun easing slightly.\\n“Until now China had been securing shipments from Brazil and Argentina for November and December,” Irazuegui said. “The immediate impact of the agreement is likely to be bearish for South American prices.”\\nIn recent months, China ramped up South American purchases during its trade stand-off with Washington. Between September and October, Chinese importers bought about 12 million tonnes from Brazil and Argentina, roughly half their demand for that period, according to research group Safras &amp; Mercado.\\nDespite the US-China thaw, Brazil remains China’s dominant soybean supplier, a Brazilian official told the Post. The South American giant has steadily expanded its grip on the Chinese market, capturing nearly 78 per cent in value terms this year.\\nAccording to the same source, this “dominance won’t erode quickly”, especially as China pursues long-term sustainability partnerships and continues diversifying its agricultural sourcing.\\n",

We came to unify the ultra-Orthodox community, that only wants to honour God.”\\n\\nCrackdown\\nThe mass demonstration follows a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox draft dodgers, with thousands of call-up notices ignored in recent months and several deserters imprisoned.\\nUnder a ruling established at the time of Israel’s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a very small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass from army service.\\nThis exemption has come under mounting pressure since the start of the war in Gaza, as the military struggles to fill its ranks.\\nWhether the exemption should be scrapped has been a long-running point of contention in Israeli society, with Netanyahu pledging that his government would pass a law enshrining the waiver.\\nBut he has so far failed to deliver.\\nResponding to the call of two ultra-Orthodox parties – one of which forms a key part of the ruling coalition – men travelled from all over Israel to join Thursday’s rally.\\nThe police announced the mobilisation of 2,000 officers in Jerusalem.\\nIn June 2024, the supreme court ruled that the state must draft ultra-Orthodox men, declaring their exemption had expired.\\nA parliamentary committee is now discussing a bill expected to end the exemptions and encourage young ultra-Orthodox men who are not studying full-time to enlist.\\n\\nVital support for coalition\\nThe issue has placed Netanyahu’s coalition – one of the most right-wing in the country’s history – under severe strain.\\nIn July, ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party resigned from the cabinet over the issue, though the party has not formally left the coalition.\\nThe other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, has already quit both the government and the coalition.\\nThe Sephardic Shas, which holds 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset, has warned that unless military service exemptions are anchored in law, it would withdraw its support – a move that could topple Netanyahu’s fragile coalition, now down to 60 seats.\\n\\nSome ultra-Orthodox rabbis fear that conscription will make young people less religious, but others accept that those who do not study holy texts full-time can enlist.\\nUltra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 per cent of Israel’s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption.\\nAccording to an army report presented to parliament in September, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews enlisting despite opposition from their leaders, but the numbers still remain low, at a few hundred over the past two years.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong health authorities have ordered a review of the city’s Medical Council after it terminated an inquiry into a paediatrician due to a prolonged procedural delay of 8½ years, as the regulatory body promised to respond within eight weeks.\\nThe move by the government came on Thursday, a day after the Patients’ Rights Association argued that the Medical Council’s ruling – the first involving a suspected medical blunder – could allow doctors to evade responsibility in future cases.\\nThe government said it was highly concerned about the handling of the case, as Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau wrote to council chairwoman Grace Tang Wai-king and required an account of the mechanism in handling complaint investigations and disciplinary inquiries.\\n“[He requested the council] to carry out a holistic review and introduce improvement recommendations in the light of the complaint case,” the statement read.\\nIt added that the council should respond to the expectations of the public and society concerning the standards and ethical conduct of healthcare professionals.\\n“The council must uphold its mission of ensuring justice, maintaining professionalism and protecting the public,” it said.\\nThe government stressed that all regulatory bodies on healthcare professions were responsible for handling complaints against practitioners through a fair, impartial, transparent and efficient investigation and disciplinary mechanism.\\nIt added that regulatory bodies must be accountable to the public for safeguarding the overall interest of society as they discharge their duties.\\n\\nThe council’s Tang on Thursday told the Post that the council would reply to the Health Bureau within eight weeks.\\nThe review stemmed from the case against Dr Sit Sou-chi, a paediatrician, who was accused of a medical blunder in Baptist Hospital on December 22, 2009.\\nSit was charged with allegedly failing to perform necessary and immediate examinations or applying treatment – a delay of 3½ hours following a newborn patient’s epileptic seizure – which later resulted in cerebral palsy and quadriplegia, leaving the child unable to care for himself for life.\\nThe baby’s parents filed a complaint with the council in 2010. The inquiry was originally scheduled to begin in 2016, but was postponed at the request of Sit to review new evidence.\\nThe case was only rescheduled for this month, after the couple said the council’s secretariat failed to set a new date and sent a legal letter to the council last year.\\nBut the council’s inquiry panel on Tuesday ordered a stay of proceedings, which the association deemed a “bad and unjust” precedent that could allow doctors suspected of negligence and malpractice to escape accountability.\\nThe association also threatened to launch a judicial review and appeal to Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu over what it called “injustice”, if the council failed to overturn its decision in two weeks.\\nAssociation spokesman Tim Pang Hung-cheong told the Post it was a “rare move” for the government to publicly place pressure on the council.\\nBut he noted that the Department of Health was also suspected of neglecting its duty, as it provided services for the council’s secretariat, and that the director of health was also a council member.\\nHe added that he hoped the inquiry panel could review its ruling to meet public expectations.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s first and only tokenised gold trading company is in talks with Beijing to obtain its endorsement for its products, which it believes can help China promote its economy to other Asian countries, the Post has learned.\\nNewly founded Esperanza Fintech, which plans to offer gold and security tokens for live entertainment shows and other projects such as shopping centres, hotels and residential projects, was upbeat on receiving Beijing’s blessing for its operations, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\\n“The firm is in discussions with Beijing authorities. It has confidence in getting its endorsement,” the insider said.\\nBeijing recently released its 15th five-year plan for China’s development, vowing in the blueprint to “fully stimulate” the vitality of all types of business entities and encourage the joint development of various forms of ownership.\\nSpelling out Esperanza’s vision, CEO Dan Ronald Leung Wai-tsun, 37, said a gold-backed tokenised economy offered an alternative capital solution to get around Western fiscal dominance for driving regional economic development amid geopolitical issues.\\nLeung added his firm aspired to reconnect Asian economies and integrate with their respective central bank digital currencies to build autonomy against reliance on Western settlement systems and interest rate policies.\\n“Tokenised gold could be integrated with central bank-led digital renminbi in the future to contribute to the internationalisation of the yuan,” he said.\\nTokenised gold refers to physical bullion whose ownership rights are stored digitally on a blockchain.\\n\\nLeung said he believed tokenised gold could serve as a settlement currency for Asian countries and boost China’s global trade bargaining power.\\n“What I see is how tokenised gold can assist China to promote its economy elsewhere in Asia,” he said.\\n“Can we use tokenised gold as a settlement currency for all the Asian countries? So this will help China have more of a bargaining chip in international trade discussions.\\n“For example, we can export our services and goods to other Asian countries … as a middleman through tokenisation to assist our country. So we expect the tokenised economy will assist Hong Kong and mainland China in achieving better economic growth.”\\nIn his policy address last month, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged to support the development of new investment products such as tokenised gold in Hong Kong as part of the government’s efforts to turn the city into an international gold settlement centre while expediting the development of the digital economy.\\nThe firm, which offers trading of gold tokens for redemption of 999.9 1kg gold bars in Hong Kong, has obtained three key licences and registrations from different government departments, including a gold dealer registration, a trusts service licence for holding tokens for clients and an asset management licence for trading of tokens.\\nLeung revealed that the firm had a meeting with the Chief Executive’s Policy Unit, which he said was positive about its operations, expecting to open its tokenised gold offerings to the Hong Kong public after addressing the concerns of the city’s regulatory bodies with a clear regulatory framework being fully implemented in the city.\\nHe noted that the government was turning its attention to developing the tokenised economy as Lee’s policy address did not mention the development of virtual assets such as stablecoins.\\n“We firmly believe that Esperanza, armed with first-mover advantages in technology and its business model … will be able to transform tokenised gold into a powerful engine in driving economic autonomy in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "What does the Xi-Trump summit’s silence on Taiwan mean for the contentious issue?",
            "description": "In a stark departure from past China-US summits, Taiwan did not rate a mention on Thursday, prompting speculation that Xi Jinping and Donald Trump had arrived at a tacit and pragmatic understanding to deprioritise the contentious issue.\\nTaiwan – regarded by Beijing as a core interest and “the first red line that cannot be crossed” in bilateral relations – has in recent years occupied a few lines in official readouts following face-to-face meetings between the countries’ leaders, but not in Busan, South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\\nAfter he met Xi, Trump told reporters “Taiwan never came up”, despite the in-person discussion being their first since the US leader returned to the White House in January.\\nThe Chinese readout, released by state news agency Xinhua, also made no mention of Taiwan. That is unusual, given that Beijing has previously used such occasions to restate its position at length and warn Washington against supporting “Taiwan independence” or arming the island.\\n\\n\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-ruled island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\nZhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s school of international studies, said the Taiwan issue had “declined” in importance in recent Sino-US diplomacy.\\n“Taiwan is not a priority for US security or foreign policy,” Zhu said. “It is clear that Trump has significantly lowered the emphasis on the Taiwan issue.”\\nThat view was echoed by Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University’s Institute of International Studies, who described Trump as “primarily interested in economic and trade matters rather than Taiwan”.\\nWu cited “a new round” of bilateral trade tensions earlier in the month as a major reason Taiwan was not broached this time. “As a result, both sides devoted most of their attention to managing trade disputes,” he said.\\nSince returning to office, Trump has vacillated on Taiwan while seeking to strike a trade deal with Beijing.\\nThursday’s 100-minute meeting appeared to focus heavily on economic issues, such as fentanyl and trade. Sensitive topics such as the South China Sea and human rights were also absent from the Chinese readout.\\nThe shift stands out because during the three in-person meetings between Xi and former US president Joe Biden held from 2022 to 2024, Taiwan was mentioned each time. The issue also came up routinely during their phone calls.\\nAnd in his phone call with Trump in January, Xi urged the American leader to “handle the Taiwan issue with utmost caution”. However, the two omitted it from their most recent call in September, instead focusing on trade.\\nIn public, Trump has appeared reluctant to throw his weight behind Taipei the same way his predecessors did.\\n\\nIn September, he declined to approve more than US$400 million in military aid meant for Taiwan. He also reportedly turned down a request this summer by Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te to transit the US.\\nMeanwhile, scepticism in Taiwan has risen about America’s defence commitment under Trump and has been exacerbated by his administration’s push for the island to invest more of its semiconductor production in the US.\\nIn light of these circumstances, Zhu said, it was “unlikely” Beijing would raise the Taiwan issue at the next meeting between the Chinese and US leaders. He added that Beijing was “not actively seeking to use force against Taiwan at this stage, and I believe the US understands this”.\\nThe Taiwan issue’s demotion as an agenda item in the Washington-Beijing dialogue stems from Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy, according to Cui Hongjian, director of the European studies department at Beijing Foreign Studies University.\\nCui said the way Taiwan was de-emphasised “even increased the possibility of reaching a certain tacit understanding” of the issue in the future. Yet he cautioned that Trump could bring up Taiwan if he saw a need to do so.\\nBefore the summit, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration would not abandon America’s long-standing support for Taiwan in its talks with Beijing.\\nAnalysts said Trump’s muted approach to the issue could affect US allies, signalling that Washington may no longer back them in “playing the Taiwan card” when dealing with Beijing.\\nCui said that if politicians or parties failed to adjust to how the US was de-prioritising Taiwan, they might find their attempts to use “the Taiwan card” less effective. Beijing’s confidence in countering such moves would thus “likely grow”, he said.\\n“Beijing will take a firmer stance when dealing with European or other countries that use the Taiwan issue to pressure China,” Cui added.\\n\\n\\nLast week, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul’s planned visit to China was postponed following an interview in which he stated that Berlin’s one-China policy “remains unchanged” but that his government would decide on its “design”.\\nBeijing subsequently urged Germany to take a clear stance against “Taiwan independence”.\\nJohn Lim Chuan-tiong, a research fellow at the University of Tokyo’s Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia, said Beijing’s silence on Taiwan might have been a deliberate negotiating tactic to prevent Trump from playing the “Taiwan card” to gain concessions.\\nLim said Beijing may have narrowed the scope of Thursday’s talks so that both sides could “focus on the most pressing issues and limit the US’ choices of response”.\\nAt the same time, Washington, which considers trade issues a top priority in China-US relations, “doesn’t mind excluding the Taiwan issue too”, he added.\\nHowever, the absence of Taiwan from the talks did not necessarily signal a shift in Beijing’s policy.\\nIn its latest five-year policy plan released this week, Beijing reiterated it would “resolutely fight against separatist forces seeking ‘Taiwan independence’ and oppose external interference”.\\nXie Maosong, a senior researcher at Tsinghua University’s National Institute of Strategic Studies, said a clear geopolitical trend was “emerging” in that Beijing had showcased its improved military strength and signalled a “staunch political will” to advance the cause of national reunification, while the Trump administration had offered little pushback.\\n",

Our focus has always been on managing China’s own affairs well,” he told Trump, according to the official Xinhua news agency.\\nEmphasising that China’s economic development continued to have “good momentum” despite mounting socio-economic pressures, Xi added, “We have the confidence and capability to navigate all kinds of risks and challenges.”\\n\\n\\nSourabh Gupta, a senior policy specialist with the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington, said Beijing might be content to leave Busan “with nothing but a rekindled bilateral relationship that is back on the rails and Trump adequately satiated”.\\nNoting the low expectations surrounding the summit, Gupta said its primary aim was to stabilise the bilateral trade relationship, which “in turn requires a modus vivendi on their technology competition – best exemplified by the recent truce in Kuala Lumpur on export controls, following the latest round of tit-for-tat measures”.\\n“The primary purpose of the [meeting] in China’s mind is to once again construct an amicable and personality-rooted relationship with a new American president – who happens to be a familiar old American president with a weakness for Xi,” he said.\\nHe added that Beijing also hoped that the message would “telepathically” get across to Trump that “if he wants a mouthwatering market access-related trade deal on the lines of the ‘phase one’ agreement of January 2020 when he visits China next year, then he must learn to rein in his Commerce Department from imposing ever-harsher export controls on China’s AI and semiconductor sectors”.\\nYun Sun, director of the China programme and co-director of the East Asia programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, described the outcomes as “positive”.\\n“There has not been a meeting between a Chinese president and his American counterpart that crashed and burned, ever. Groundwork has been laid for this to be a productive and positive meeting,” she said, pointing to the framework agreement on trade reached in Kuala Lumpur over the weekend.\\n“Both sides will get something but not everything. That means leverages, and more negotiations down the road.”\\nWhile the summit represented a shared willingness to re-engage after years of tit-for-tat escalation, Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based professor of international affairs, noted its modest outcomes were largely in line with public expectations.\\n“Both sides made concessions and achieved some results. I don’t believe either side truly emerged as a winner,” he said. “US-China relations are currently in a new cold war, marked by deep mutual distrust and hostility. At best, this was a ‘no-loss’ outcome for both.”\\nThe meeting followed months of escalating tariff tensions since April, with Trump threatening to impose additional 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods alongside tighter restrictions on semiconductor technologies, while Beijing responded with curbs on rare earth exports.\\nBoth sides would face serious consequences if the tariff war escalated and China continued its rare earth export controls, according to Shen.\\n“The key issue now is whether the outcomes can be implemented and whether both sides will honour the agreement,” he said, noting that some in the US believed China had a track record of not fulfilling its commitments.\\n“So the enforcement of this deal remains to be seen.”\\nBut he questioned Trump’s claim that Xi had agreed to cooperate more on seeking an end to the war in Ukraine.\\nChina insists it is a neutral party in the conflict. But Beijing has never denounced Russia’s invasion and has edged closer to Moscow amid an intensifying feud with Washington.\\n“China’s position has not changed. China has previously stated that it cannot afford a Russian defeat, while the US cannot accept a Ukrainian defeat. Therefore, the notion of ‘cooperation’ is likely more of a symbolic gesture than a substantive shift,” he said.\\nShi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, also said Trump’s statement was “almost certainly exaggerated”.\\nHe noted that, according to a Reuters report from a week ago, several major Chinese state-owned oil companies had temporarily suspended purchases of seaborne Russian crude oil in the lead-up to the Busan summit.\\n“So cooperation is possible, but it doesn’t mean it will be lasting,” he said. “In other words, China could be willing to make temporary sacrifices with Russia to create the appearance of a thaw in US-China relations.”\\nShi said that while Trump’s mention of “G2” – an idea dating back to the Obama era – was notable, its significance should not be overstated.\\n“That’s Trump. Despite his bluster, his strategic thinking is clear: he leans on America’s overwhelming military power, the dominance of the US dollar, and the reality that every country needs access to the American market,” he said.\\nHe added that no US leader had ever defined what G2 actually meant.\\n“Does it imply China and the US are equals? If so, they would have embraced Xi’s long-standing proposal that the Pacific is wide enough for two major powers. But in reality, they’ve never accepted that idea,” he said.\\nShen echoed this scepticism, saying China had previously rejected the G2 concept and was likely to do so again.\\n“China seeks leadership status equal to the US, but is unwilling to shoulder the same global responsibilities. It may also see Trump’s G2 rhetoric as a way to leverage China’s influence to boost America’s global standing.”\\nLooking ahead, Shen predicted both sides would accelerate efforts towards self-reliance and reduce strategic dependence on each other.\\n“If existing mechanisms can keep US-China relations stable for a few months, that would already be a success,” he said.\\nGupta highlighted the absence of renewed dialogue mechanisms, particularly military-to-military exchanges.\\n“Now that a rough-and-ready stabilisation of the trade and tech relationship seems to be taking hold, the leaders-level meeting is the ideal jumping off point to start building out a number of dialogue mechanisms, like the diplomatic and security dialogue, the comprehensive economic dialogue, the law enforcement and cybersecurity dialogue and the social and people-to-people dialogue during Trump 1.0,” he said.\\n“A building out of dialogue mechanisms would in fact be a marker by which to judge the success or importance of this Busan meeting.”\\n",
