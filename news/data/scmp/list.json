            "title": "The quiet US-China tech contest for the future",
            "description": "Power shifts begin in places most people never see – on assembly lines making batteries and robots, along transmission lines feeding data centre clusters, in local offices selling land and in labs training artificial intelligence models. The United States and China are using these quiet levers to construct different futures.\\nThe contest will be decided not by slogans but by who builds the most productive, trusted and durable infrastructure. Those choices will shape billions of lives.\\nThe global supply chain for clean technologies shows why. China dominates solar manufacturing, from raw materials to finished panels. Its share at every stage of the process exceeds 80 per cent. Years of credit, industrial policy and scale have pushed costs so low that solar expansion elsewhere pretty much depends on Chinese exports.\\nElectric vehicles show a similar pattern: China sells most of them. EVs make up a much larger share of its car market than in the US. These strengths give China leverage in pricing, innovation and standards.\\nThis is amplified by automation. In 2024, nearly three-quarters of all industrial robots were installed in Asia. China installed more than the rest of the world combined. Robots help offset a workforce shortage. China is also turning manufacturing muscle into scientific momentum: its researchers produce as many artificial intelligence (AI) papers as the US, Britain and European Union combined, capture a large share of global citation attention and file far more AI-related patents.\\nYet, the US still dominates the frontier: its private investment in AI dwarfs China’s. American companies also produce most of the top-performing models. Scale on one side and cutting-edge innovation on the other define this competition.\\n\\n\\nChina is weaving AI into daily life. Cities such as Shenzhen are testing electric vertical take-off and landing drones to carry passengers. More sites and similar projects are either under way or being planned in other cities across China. These initiatives tie AI and robotics to real infrastructure, signalling technological leadership at home and abroad.\\nWhile China links AI to physical systems, the US leads at the cutting edge but struggles on the ground. US growth, in the first half of this year, would have been negligible without spending on data centres and information-processing equipment. Those categories account for a small slice of gross domestic product but most of the growth. Companies are pouring hundreds of billions into AI, hoping it will unlock productivity gains.\\nThat bet carries heavy environmental costs. Data centres consume more than 4 per cent of US electricity and demand is only expected to grow by the end of the decade. In Virginia, for example, clusters of server farms draw more than a quarter of the state’s power.\\nMany facilities draw as much power as small cities. The largest will require a lot of energy. They also consume vast amounts of water for cooling. Every extra terawatt-hour matters because much of the electricity feeding server farms still comes from gas, so emissions will rise as workloads grow. These pressures fall first on local communities.\\n\\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, regulators recently approved a huge new power load for a supercomputer project. Residents worry about more pollution and grid strain. Similar battles are playing out across several states as utilities scramble to build new gas plants even as renewable projects languish for want of transmission.\\nGeopolitics shapes these domestic choices. Washington has tightened export controls on advanced chips and imposed tariffs on Chinese clean tech. Europe, wary of dependency on both superpowers, is charting its own course. The European Commission recently unveiled a €1 billion (US$1.1 billion) programme to inject AI across healthcare, energy, mobility and manufacturing.\\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants the future of AI developed in Europe, and the programme includes testing centres, agentic AI development and matching funds. Europe aims to reduce its reliance on foreign technologies and set its own safety and trust standards. The contest is no longer only between Washington and Beijing; smaller actors are asserting independence too.\\nBoth powers face structural headwinds. China’s population is shrinking and local governments depend on land sales, which have slowed. The property sector is overleveraged, foreign investment has weakened and capital is flowing out. Robots and EVs can offset labour shortages, but household consumption still lags.\\n\\nThe US has abundant land and capital, but often lacks the will or coordination to build. Hundreds of manufacturing projects have been announced, promising hundreds of thousands of jobs, yet industrial construction has slowed. Transmission bottlenecks, training shortfalls and tight immigration policies stand in the way.\\nHistory shows that power rests in working systems. British coal and steam defined the 19th century; American oil, highways and mass manufacturing defined the 20th. The 21st century will be determined by whoever builds the most trusted, efficient and adaptive technological systems. China’s strength lies in the scale and integration of its near-monopolies in solar, batteries, EVs and armies of robots, as well as a broad AI research ecosystem.\\nThe US’ strength lies in frontier innovation, deep capital markets and the ability to attract global talent.\\nThe best outcome will be competitive stability, where systems are tested in the real world and other countries can make meaningful choices. That requires honest accounting, community benefits and tough decisions in permitting, property and equity. Hi-tech investment must be paired with policies that protect workers and communities. The quiet contest has begun; its measures are unforgiving.\\n",

A bullet remains in her chest.\\n“I thought I had died. I thought I was either on my way to heaven or in heaven,” Zwerner testified.\\n“But then it all got black.

            "title": "Brazil shrugs off US-China soybean deal as seasonal trade",
            "description": "Brazil’s soybean producers are downplaying concerns over a freshly minted US-China trade agreement that will see Beijing resume large-scale purchases of American soybeans, insisting the 12 million tonnes (13.23 million tons) pledged represents routine seasonal trade rather than a market upheaval.\\nMauricio Buffon, president of Brazil’s Soybean Producers Association (Aprosoja), said the volume announced by Washington and Beijing on Wednesday should not alarm Brazilian exporters, framing it as part of normal supply cycles.\\n“It is a movement that happens every year,” Buffon said in an interview to CNN Money Brazil.\\n“The United States has soybeans available now because they have just harvested. Brazil, on the other hand, is planting the new crop and has low stocks.”\\nThe accord, unveiled after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in South Korea marks a potential turning point for American farmers battered by months of suspended Chinese orders.\\n\\n\\nUnder the deal, China would immediately resume agricultural purchases whilst also reducing certain trade barriers and import tariffs.\\nTrump hailed the agreement as a win for US farmers and global market stability.\\nBut for Brazil, which sends roughly three-quarters of its soybean exports to China, worth nearly $44 billion last year, the rapprochement has sparked both wariness and calculation.\\nStill, Buffon suggested stronger US sales could actually lift prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, indirectly helping Brazilian growers.\\n“The market will oscillate a lot over the next 60 days,” he said. “Producers need to stay alert and take advantage of good commercial opportunities.”\\nYet he warned of serious domestic headwinds. Buffon characterised the 2025-26 planting season as “a crop without money”, citing delayed federal credit and stalled government farm support. As of mid-October, more than half the funding for Brazil’s main agricultural credit programme hadn’t reached producers.\\n“Without investment in fertilisers and soil correction, we risk an average crop,” Buffon said, adding that tight credit and dry weather could crimp output in major producing states like Mato Grosso and Parana.\\nWeaker production would strain Brazil’s trade balance and potentially drive up domestic food prices, he said, pointing to recent spikes in rice and bean costs.\\nAnalysts across South America are weighing the deal’s ramifications. In Argentina, grain analyst Eugenio Irazuegui of brokerage Zeni told La Nacion that whilst soybean futures continued climbing globally, premiums for South American cargoes had begun easing slightly.\\n“Until now China had been securing shipments from Brazil and Argentina for November and December,” Irazuegui said. “The immediate impact of the agreement is likely to be bearish for South American prices.”\\nIn recent months, China ramped up South American purchases during its trade stand-off with Washington. Between September and October, Chinese importers bought about 12 million tonnes from Brazil and Argentina, roughly half their demand for that period, according to research group Safras &amp; Mercado.\\nDespite the US-China thaw, Brazil remains China’s dominant soybean supplier, a Brazilian official told the Post. The South American giant has steadily expanded its grip on the Chinese market, capturing nearly 78 per cent in value terms this year.\\nAccording to the same source, this “dominance won’t erode quickly”, especially as China pursues long-term sustainability partnerships and continues diversifying its agricultural sourcing.\\n",

We came to unify the ultra-Orthodox community, that only wants to honour God.”\\n\\nCrackdown\\nThe mass demonstration follows a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox draft dodgers, with thousands of call-up notices ignored in recent months and several deserters imprisoned.\\nUnder a ruling established at the time of Israel’s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a very small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass from army service.\\nThis exemption has come under mounting pressure since the start of the war in Gaza, as the military struggles to fill its ranks.\\nWhether the exemption should be scrapped has been a long-running point of contention in Israeli society, with Netanyahu pledging that his government would pass a law enshrining the waiver.\\nBut he has so far failed to deliver.\\nResponding to the call of two ultra-Orthodox parties – one of which forms a key part of the ruling coalition – men travelled from all over Israel to join Thursday’s rally.\\nThe police announced the mobilisation of 2,000 officers in Jerusalem.\\nIn June 2024, the supreme court ruled that the state must draft ultra-Orthodox men, declaring their exemption had expired.\\nA parliamentary committee is now discussing a bill expected to end the exemptions and encourage young ultra-Orthodox men who are not studying full-time to enlist.\\n\\nVital support for coalition\\nThe issue has placed Netanyahu’s coalition – one of the most right-wing in the country’s history – under severe strain.\\nIn July, ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party resigned from the cabinet over the issue, though the party has not formally left the coalition.\\nThe other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, has already quit both the government and the coalition.\\nThe Sephardic Shas, which holds 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset, has warned that unless military service exemptions are anchored in law, it would withdraw its support – a move that could topple Netanyahu’s fragile coalition, now down to 60 seats.\\n\\nSome ultra-Orthodox rabbis fear that conscription will make young people less religious, but others accept that those who do not study holy texts full-time can enlist.\\nUltra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 per cent of Israel’s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption.\\nAccording to an army report presented to parliament in September, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews enlisting despite opposition from their leaders, but the numbers still remain low, at a few hundred over the past two years.\\n",

The inquiry was originally scheduled to begin in 2016, but was postponed at the request of Sit to review new evidence.\\nThe case was only rescheduled for this month, after the couple said the council’s secretariat failed to set a new date and sent a legal letter to the council last year.\\nBut the council’s inquiry panel on Tuesday ordered a stay of proceedings, which the association deemed a “bad and unjust” precedent that could allow doctors suspected of negligence and malpractice to escape accountability.\\nThe association also threatened to launch a judicial review and appeal to Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu over what it called “injustice”, if the council failed to overturn its decision in two weeks.\\nAssociation spokesman Tim Pang Hung-cheong told the Post it was a “rare move” for the government to publicly place pressure on the council.\\nBut he noted that the Department of Health was also suspected of neglecting its duty, as it provided services for the council’s secretariat, and that the director of health was also a council member.\\nHe added that he hoped the inquiry panel could review its ruling to meet public expectations.\\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s first and only tokenised gold trading company is in talks with Beijing to obtain its endorsement for its products, which it believes can help China promote its economy to other Asian countries, the Post has learned.\\nNewly founded Esperanza Fintech, which plans to offer gold and security tokens for live entertainment shows and other projects such as shopping centres, hotels and residential projects, was upbeat on receiving Beijing’s blessing for its operations, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\\n“The firm is in discussions with Beijing authorities. It has confidence in getting its endorsement,” the insider said.\\nBeijing recently released its 15th five-year plan for China’s development, vowing in the blueprint to “fully stimulate” the vitality of all types of business entities and encourage the joint development of various forms of ownership.\\nSpelling out Esperanza’s vision, CEO Dan Ronald Leung Wai-tsun, 37, said a gold-backed tokenised economy offered an alternative capital solution to get around Western fiscal dominance for driving regional economic development amid geopolitical issues.\\nLeung added his firm aspired to reconnect Asian economies and integrate with their respective central bank digital currencies to build autonomy against reliance on Western settlement systems and interest rate policies.\\n“Tokenised gold could be integrated with central bank-led digital renminbi in the future to contribute to the internationalisation of the yuan,” he said.\\nTokenised gold refers to physical bullion whose ownership rights are stored digitally on a blockchain.\\n\\nLeung said he believed tokenised gold could serve as a settlement currency for Asian countries and boost China’s global trade bargaining power.\\n“What I see is how tokenised gold can assist China to promote its economy elsewhere in Asia,” he said.\\n“Can we use tokenised gold as a settlement currency for all the Asian countries? So this will help China have more of a bargaining chip in international trade discussions.\\n“For example, we can export our services and goods to other Asian countries … as a middleman through tokenisation to assist our country. So we expect the tokenised economy will assist Hong Kong and mainland China in achieving better economic growth.”\\nIn his policy address last month, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged to support the development of new investment products such as tokenised gold in Hong Kong as part of the government’s efforts to turn the city into an international gold settlement centre while expediting the development of the digital economy.\\nThe firm, which offers trading of gold tokens for redemption of 999.9 1kg gold bars in Hong Kong, has obtained three key licences and registrations from different government departments, including a gold dealer registration, a trusts service licence for holding tokens for clients and an asset management licence for trading of tokens.\\nLeung revealed that the firm had a meeting with the Chief Executive’s Policy Unit, which he said was positive about its operations, expecting to open its tokenised gold offerings to the Hong Kong public after addressing the concerns of the city’s regulatory bodies with a clear regulatory framework being fully implemented in the city.\\nHe noted that the government was turning its attention to developing the tokenised economy as Lee’s policy address did not mention the development of virtual assets such as stablecoins.\\n“We firmly believe that Esperanza, armed with first-mover advantages in technology and its business model … will be able to transform tokenised gold into a powerful engine in driving economic autonomy in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.\\n",
