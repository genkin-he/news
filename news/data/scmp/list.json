            "description": "The ex-girlfriend of a fugitive Hong Kong activist has pleaded guilty to sedition under the domestic national security law for promoting a self-styled parliament-in-exile in Canada seeking to overthrow the city government.\\nBettie Lan Fei, 19, on Friday admitted breaching the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance for helping produce two promotional videos for the “Hong Kong Parliament” and rallying support for the organisation in private messages to a friend between March and May this year.\\nWest Kowloon Court heard how the jobless defendant accepted a C$200 reward to appear in videos encouraging Hongkongers to vote in the group’s election, after being convinced by her then partner, Tony Lam, that her actions would not violate the law.\\nThe self-proclaimed parliament aims to achieve Hong Kong independence, eliminate the Communist Party of China and promote the international recognition of the party as a transnational criminal organisation, according to a prosecution case summary.\\nNational security police have issued HK$200,000 bounties for 15 overseas Hongkongers for their involvement in the group, including 36-year-old Lam, who ran in the poll and was sworn in as a so-called parliament member.\\nIn two promotional videos dated April and May 2025, Lan, who was portrayed as a “new-generation Hongkonger”, described the group as fighting for residents’ rights and helping their jailed “comrades”. She also called on the audience to cast a vote via a mobile app.\\nUpon her arrest in July this year, police discovered Instagram messages on her mobile phone in which she encouraged a friend to join the vote.\\n\\nLan told police that she had filmed the videos abroad at her ex-boyfriend’s instructions, but denied ever voting at the election or joining the group in any capacity.\\nShe said Victor Ho Leung-mau, a co-founder of the group’s now-dissolved electoral committee, provided her with the scripts and paid her C$100 for each video appearance.\\nThe defendant pleaded guilty to a count of “doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention”, which is punishable by up to seven years in jail.\\nAny Hong Kong resident committing sedition outside the city can be held liable for the crime under the ordinance, which was enacted as a requirement of Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.\\nIn court, Chief Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak questioned the degree of Lan’s involvement and noted a social media message that appeared to suggest she was originally slated to work for the group as a “councillor assistant”.\\nDefence counsel Luke McGuinniety said the text was written without his client’s knowledge and stressed she had no intention to join the parliament or take part in its future elections.\\nMcGuinniety described the defendant as a young and naive woman who toed the line and followed her then boyfriend’s ill-gotten advice.\\nHe said Lan had become dependent on Lam after moving to Canada due to her inability to communicate in English and her difficulties adjusting to the new environment.\\nAfter the couple broke up, the 19-year-old thought that she could wipe her slate clean by returning to Hong Kong, the lawyer continued.\\n“It’s an indication of her naivety and total lack of understanding of the significance of her actions, the criminality of her involvement … She came back to Hong Kong completely unaware of the stupidity of her actions,” McGuinniety said.\\n“The obsession for likes, fanfare and approval may very well be what trapped this woman.”\\nThe court adjourned sentencing until November 13, pending a background assessment of the defendant.\\nLan, who has been detained since her prosecution in August, remains in custody.\\n",

            "description": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said military ties with India have “never been stronger” following a meeting with his counterpart Rajnath Singh, signalling that trade tensions have not affected broader strategic cooperation.\\nDuring the Friday meeting, the two renewed a 10-year defence framework, with Hegseth calling the India-US partnership “one of the most consequential” in the world. This was their first in-person meeting and took place on the sidelines of a gathering of defence chiefs from Asean in Kuala Lumpur.\\n“This new 10-year defence framework we signed is ambitious,” Hegseth added. “It’s a significant step for our two militaries, a road map for deeper and even more meaningful collaboration ahead.”\\nSingh said that the framework will “open new doors” to bilateral ties.\\nRelations between New Delhi and Washington have deteriorated sharply in recent months, following the Trump administration’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports – partly as punishment for purchases of Russian oil. Still, despite the tensions, the two sides have maintained defence ties and continued joint military exercises.\\n\\n\\nWashington has long positioned India as a strategic counterweight to an increasingly assertive China in the Indo-Pacific, a role likely to remain intact even amid trade-related hostilities.\\nEarlier in the day, Hegseth voiced serious concerns in talks with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun about Beijing’s naval activity around Taiwan and the South China Sea, citing its impact on US security partners in the region.\\nWhile signs of a thaw have emerged in trade relations between India and the US, Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped the Asean summit to avoid a meeting with President Donald Trump.\\n",

            "title": "Lemongrass recipe: how to make Vietnamese rice noodles with lemongrass chicken",
            "description": "Lemongrass is a useful plant. It is used as an insect repellent and also yields citronella oil, which is said to soothe the stomach, ease depression and stimulate the mind.\\nOf course, it also has culinary uses. The thick, tough, juicy stalks of the lemongrass plant are used as a flavouring in many Southeast Asian cuisines. The flavour is somewhat like lemon, but more subtle and complex.\\nLemongrass is usually sold as stalks that are about 30cm (12 inches) long. Most of the plant needs to be trimmed off, and the dry outer layers should be peeled away to get at the thick, moist core at the base of the stalk (the top portion and outer leaves do not need to be wasted, though; you can chop them up and brew them into a tisane).\\nBecause the core is tough, it needs to be very finely sliced, or you can cut it into thin pieces and pound them in a mortar, to use in spice blends. If you are using larger pieces (to flavour soups, for instance), then bruise the core by crushing it with the flat side of a knife.\\n\\nLemongrass is used in many types of sambal. To make one for fish, finely chop the juicy core of several lemongrass stalks. Cook the lemongrass in oil with sliced shallot, minced garlic, finely chopped bird’s-eye chilli and a small chunk of belacan (dried, fermented shrimp paste).\\nCook for several minutes, or until the ingredients are fragrant and cohesive, then add fresh lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Spread the paste in the cavity and on the skin of a whole fish.\\nWrap the fish in banana leaves and grill over hot coals. Squeeze more lime juice over the fish before serving.\\n\\nVietnamese rice noodles with lemongrass chicken (bun ga nuong)\\nI use chicken thighs for this dish, and remove the bones myself – shops usually sell boneless whole legs, with the thigh and drumstick together. The drumstick has a lot of tendons that need to be removed.\\nCutting out the bone from the thigh takes about 30 seconds, but if you can find just boneless thighs (without the drumsticks), then use those if you prefer. If you substitute boneless chicken breasts, take care not to overcook them – they will need about 10 minutes under the grill.\\nFor the lemongrass chicken:\\n4 bone-in chicken thighs, about 200 grams each (or 180 grams each if they are boneless)\\n90ml fish sauce\\n30 grams granulated sugar\\n2 lemongrass stalks, the juicy lower stem (about 8cm) only\\n4 garlic cloves, peeled\\n2 spring onions\\n½ tsp freshly ground black pepper\\nFor the nuoc cham (dipping sauce):\\n45 grams granulated sugar\\n60ml fish sauce\\n25ml fresh lime juice\\n2-3 garlic cloves, peeled\\n2-4 red bird’s-eye chillies\\nFor the noodles and to serve:\\n250 grams thin rice noodles\\n45ml cooking oil\\n3 spring onions\\n50 grams roasted, shelled peanuts\\n150 grams shredded carrot\\n1 Asian cucumber\\nLettuce leaves\\nFresh herbs, such as mint, Thai basil and fresh coriander\\nBean sprouts\\n1. Marinate the chicken. If using bone-in thighs, use a sharp paring knife to cut down to the bone on the meaty side of the thigh, slicing it along the entire length of the bone. Use the tip of the knife to detach the meat from one end by cutting it around the joint, then scrape the meat from the bone until you reach the other joint. Detach the meat from the second joint end. Put the boneless thighs in a medium-sized bowl.\\n2. Mix the fish sauce with the sugar and stir to dissolve. Mix in the pepper.\\n3. Use the flat side of a meat mallet (or the side of a cleaver) to lightly crush the length of the lemongrass stalks. Mince them as finely as possible and add the pieces to the bowl with the fish sauce and sugar mixture.\\n4. Finely mince the garlic and spring onions, then add them to the bowl. Pour the mixture over the chicken thighs and mix well. Refrigerate for about three hours, mixing occasionally. Remove from the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to cook the chicken.\\n5. Put the rice noodles in a large bowl, add tepid water to cover them by about 2cm and leave to soak until needed.\\n6. Make the nuoc cham. Pour the sugar into a bowl and add 50ml of hot water. Stir to dissolve the sugar, then cool to room temperature.\\n\\n7. Add the fish sauce and lime juice to the bowl with the sugar. Mince the garlic and thinly slice the chillies, squeezing out and discarding the seeds as you go. Add the garlic and chillies to the bowl, then set aside until needed.\\n8. Prepare the noodles and other ingredients for the lemongrass chicken. Drain the soaked noodles in a colander. Bring a large pot of water to the boil, add the noodles and cook for about 30 seconds, or until just tender. Drain in a colander, then put them into a mixing bowl.\\n9. Finely mince the spring onions, then put them into a small pan. Add the cooking oil and place over a medium flame. Heat the oil until it sizzles, then turn off the flame and cool slightly. Pour the oil and spring onion over the noodles and mix with chopsticks or tongs until the noodles are lightly coated.\\n10. Roughly chop the peanuts, then put them into a small bowl. Slice the cucumber in half lengthwise, then cut into thin slices.\\n11. Put the lettuce leaves, bean sprouts, herbs and cucumber on a plate. Add a small amount of the shredded carrot to the bowl holding the nuoc cham, then put the rest on the plate with the herbs and lettuce.\\n12. Heat the oven grill to high. Place the chicken thighs, skin-side down, on a grill rack placed over a pan and slide it into the oven so the meat is about 3cm away from the heating element. Cook for about six minutes, or until the chicken is brown in spots. Flip the pieces over and slide the grill rack back into the oven. Grill for another nine minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and lightly charred in spots. If the chicken browns too much, put the pan further away from the heat.\\n\\n13. Leave the chicken pieces at room temperature for about five minutes, then slice about 1cm thick.\\n14. Take a few strands of rice vermicelli and dip them into the nuoc cham, then taste. If the sauce is too strong, dilute it with a little water.\\n15. Divide the rice vermicelli between four individual serving bowls and place one chicken thigh over each portion. Let the guests add the peanuts, vegetables and herbs to their bowl as they wish, mixing them in along with some nuoc cham.\\nThis content first appeared in Post Magazine in 2014 and 2020.\\n",

            "description": "The port-fee postponement announced by China and the United States offers a glimmer of relief to the shipping industry, but analysts warn that a one-year suspension is insufficient to eliminate persistent uncertainties, as maritime measures continue to serve as leverage in broader geopolitical tensions.\\nFollowing the highly anticipated meeting between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in South Korea on Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that the US would suspend its Section 301 investigation targeting China’s maritime and shipbuilding sectors and related measures for a year. And in response, China would subsequently pause its retaliatory port fee for the same period.\\nAlthough the US did not specify when the suspension would take effect, and China stated that it would only follow through if the US acts first, the agreement appears to offer a short-term reprieve – or at least sends a positive signal – amid continuous volatility in the shipping industry and global trade this year.\\nThe World Shipping Council was “very encouraged” to hear the news and was looking forward to more specific details, the Washington-headquartered trade association representing the international liner shipping industry said by email.\\n“Global trade flows best when it flows freely, and a suspension of ship fees by the United States and China is a win for farmers, exporters and consumers. Avoiding additional costs helps keep trade competitive and maintains access to critical shipping lanes,” the trade body said.\\nAt freight booking and payment platform Freightos, head of research Judah Levine said the suspension was unlikely to trigger a surge in transpacific freight demand, but it does provide supply-chain stakeholders with greater certainty and stability than at any previous point this year.\\nAnd at shipbroker Banchero Costa, global head of research Ralph Leszczynski said: “These policies on port fees on both sides were just a politics-driven decision which did not take into account the practical realities on the ground.”\\n\\n\\nThe port fees imposed by Washington and Beijing are based on a vessel’s ownership, operator, flag state and country of build – a set of criteria that has been widely criticised as ambiguous, creating uncertainty and undermining trade efficiency for both sides.\\nGiven how impractical those criteria were, especially considering the US administration’s history of inconsistent trade policies, there have been broad expectations that port fees would be reversed or at least watered down, Leszczynski said.\\nHowever, since neither side has officially confirmed the postponement in writing, uncertainty remains, though both Washington and Beijing have struck a positive tone regarding the results of the presidential meeting and future negotiations.\\nHailing his meeting with Xi as “amazing”, Trump said he planned to visit China in April, followed by a trip by Xi to the US later.\\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday after the meeting, Trump said the port fee was “no longer an issue”.\\nGiven the time-limited nature of the suspension, shipping lines are likely to maintain some compliance with restrictions while maintaining vessel-reshuffling plans, Lars Jensen, CEO of maritime consultancy Vespucci Maritime, said via social media on Thursday.\\nSimon Heaney, a senior manager of container research at maritime consultancy Drewry, also expressed hope in a social media post that “this agreement has some permanency, something sorely lacking thus far”.\\n“The whole sorry saga is a painful reminder how shipping is just a pawn in the superpower tussle for supremacy,” he said.\\n",

            "description": "Tesla will make a return to the world’s largest import trade fair in Shanghai next week, after skipping two major events in China’s commercial hub over the past two years.\\nThe US electric vehicle (EV) maker will showcase its Cybercab robotaxi at the China International Import Expo (CIIE), marking the Asia-Pacific debut of its driverless model.\\n“The trade fair will help Tesla show how it is actively integrating artificial intelligence into the real world,” the company said in a statement. “We are redefining the labour, transportation, and new energy industries.”\\nTesla’s comeback to the CIIE comes as its mainland sales fell 6 per cent year on year in the first nine months of 2025, underscoring intensifying competition from local rivals.\\nMainland China – the world’s largest automotive and EV market – remains Tesla’s second-largest market after the US.\\nIts Shanghai Gigafactory, the company’s biggest production hub globally, delivered 432,704 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to mainland customers between January and September, representing 4.9 per cent of the country’s total EV deliveries during that period.\\nTesla once commanded a 16 per cent share of China’s EV market when it began local production in 2020, but its share slid to 6.9 per cent last year amid an intensifying price war and the rise of domestic brands.\\nThe company unveiled its Cybercab in the US last year. CEO Elon Musk said then that Tesla aimed to produce more than 2 million units annually, with mass production expected to start next year.\\nTesla was absent from last year’s CIIE and from the Shanghai Auto Show in April, without offering an explanation.\\n\\nLaunched in 2018, the CIIE serves as a platform for China to demonstrate its commitment to free trade and greater market access. It is also regarded by many foreign firms as a key marketing opportunity, as Beijing encourages local companies to buy imported goods.\\nIn 2024, purchase agreements worth US$80 billion were signed during the six-day event, up 2 per cent from the previous year.\\nThis year’s fair will begin on Wednesday, featuring participation from international carmakers including General Motors, Volkswagen and BMW, according to the organisers.\\nSeparately, the Shanghai Auto Show, held every two years, drew more than 70 carmakers from 26 countries and regions this year, with over 100 new models launched, according to the Shanghai Council for the Promotion of International Trade.\\nChina could see as many as 300,000 driverless taxis operating in its four top-tier cities by 2030, supported by rapid advances in AI and the fiercely competitive EV sector, according to UBS.\\nThat number could climb to 4 million by the late 2030s, as more passengers embraced autonomous transport, said Paul Gong, head of China automotive research at UBS.\\n",

            "title": "ONE Championship: Christian Lee vows to finish off Alibeg Rasulov in Tokyo rematch",
            "description": "Christian Lee is returning to Tokyo for ONE 173 with a clear mission: the reigning ONE Championship lightweight and welterweight MMA king wants to erase the memory of his accidental eye poke that halted his first bout with Alibeg Rasulov and prove once again he is one of the greatest finishers in the promotion’s history.\\nThe 27-year-old has spent two years on the sidelines since becoming a two-division world champion. Now back to defend his lightweight crown against the undefeated Russian contender, Lee is fuelled by legacy and family pride as he prepares to compete in Japan once more.\\n“I’m excited to be going back to Tokyo,” the Canadian-born American told the Post. “The crowd is great and the fans are amazing. Most importantly, I’m just excited to get back in there and finish what I started in this rematch.”\\nThe first fight between Lee and Rasulov in Bangkok last December ended abruptly in round two because of the foul, leaving the lightweight title picture unresolved. Lee insists he was building momentum when the incident took place and expects no slow start this time around.\\n“In our first fight, I felt like the momentum was starting to shift my way,” he said. “One more round and I feel like I could have gotten him out of there. Going into this fight, I’ll be looking to pick up right where I left off.\\n“There’ll be no need for a feeling-out process.”\\n\\nEye pokes have become a hot topic in mixed martial arts, especially after the UFC heavyweight title fight at UFC 321 ended in a “no contest” after champion Tom Aspinall got eye poked by challenger Ciryl Gane. Lee understands the debate first-hand, but stresses that most fouls are accidental.\\n“It’s a fight. You never know what’s going to happen in there,” he said. “I don’t feel there are many guys who intentionally poke the eye. You’re thinking about landing strikes, defence, grappling. In my fight, I had no idea until they replayed it. You have to look at situations case by case.”\\nFor a fighter with Lee’s all-action style, the solution is not obvious. He recognised the need for fairness while acknowledging the chaos of real combat.\\n“It’s hard to say what should be done. You don’t want to let people get away with it if it’s intentional, but when two guys are in there fighting, you can’t control every moment.”\\n\\n\\nLee has built his reputation on finishing opponents with ruthless efficiency. He became the youngest-ever male MMA world champion in ONE history when he knocked out Shinya Aoki in 2019, then added the welterweight belt with a dramatic comeback stoppage of Kiamrian Abbasov in 2022.\\nAsked how he saw the rematch ending, his answer was direct.\\n“I think I’m going to take him down and submit him. First round,” he said. “Nice fun way would be to take him down, submit him, get my pay cheque.”\\nFatherhood had added new motivation to his career after time away from the cage. He said supporting his family had sharpened his focus.\\n“Becoming a dad has made me a stronger fighter,” he said. “It’s so rewarding to fight, provide for my family, and do what I love.”\\n\\nThe Lee family name carries elite standards in the sport. Christian’s sister Angela retired in 2023 after a historic run as atomweight world champion, while brother Adrian is a rising teenage prodigy. Adrian suffered the first loss of his young career this year, a moment Christian believed would fuel his growth.\\n“These lessons really propel you to make changes and become better,” he said. “It’s only a matter of time before he fights for a title.”\\nFor now, Christian’s focus was solely on Rasulov and a dominant return in a country steeped in martial arts history.\\n“To defend my belt in Japan feels like a big event and a historic one,” he said. “I’m excited to be back in there.”\\nNo special walkout. No fanfare. Just business.\\n“I plan on going out there, walking forward and getting my hand raised,” he said.\\n",

Investigators are still investigating the circumstances of his death.\\nOn Friday, Sessions Court Judge Syahliza Warnoh said Zayn’s mother, Ismanira Abdul Manaf, had failed to disprove the prosecution’s case that her negligence had led to physical injury to her son, according to a report by national newswire Bernama.\\nThe crime carries a maximum fine of 50,000 ringgit (US$11,800), up to 20 years&apos; jail or both.\\nIsmanira, 30, was instructed to begin her sentence on Friday.\\n\\n\\nHer case centred on witness accounts that she had let her son roam around their housing block unsupervised on the day that he went missing.\\nPolice also secured transcripts of WhatsApp messages shared between Ismarina and her husband, Zaim Ikhwan Zahari, which included lines of her saying she was “so stressed I could die” and that she had “spanked his bottom” when she was annoyed and angry with Zayn’s behaviour.\\nZaim, also 30, was acquitted of a similar charge in July.\\nThe case has raised widespread concern over the level of support available for families with special needs children, especially when both parents are working, as in the case of Zayn’s family.\\nSocial work experts have called for deeper community involvement to help parents watch out for their special needs children in the aftermath of Zayn’s case, and to shed pervasive social stigmas surrounding mental and physical disabilities.\\nNearly 290,000 students registered in schools across the country were categorised as having either physical or mental disabilities last year, according to government data.\\nOf the figure, over 23,600 were diagnosed with autism, while more than 9,500 suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\\n",

            "description": "The Philippines and Canada are set to sign a visiting forces agreement, a military cooperation pact that would allow troops from both countries on each other’s soil for joint exercises and other activities amid China’s increasing influence in the region.\\nCanadian Minister of National Defence David McGuinty will be in Manila on Sunday to hold bilateral meetings with Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr and sign the agreement, according to an advisory released by the Department of National Defence on Wednesday.\\nThe signing of the agreement follows steps by Manila and Ottawa to deepen their security relations since inking a Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation in January last year.\\nCooperation between both countries “has expanded both in breadth and depth across all areas of defence, especially in maritime security, cybersecurity and capacity building”, according to a statement by the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs in April.\\n\\nAnalysts called the agreement a natural step forward in the deepening security ties between the Philippines and Canada as both countries were concerned about China’s military build-up in the Indo-Pacific region.\\nDon McLain Gill, an international relations lecturer at De La Salle University, told This Week in Asia that the agreement allowed both countries to efficiently deploy troops and circumvent the bureaucratic delays that come with joint military exercises.\\n“The [agreement] would streamline military-to-military cooperation with the Philippines, and this would in fact reiterate and reinforce the 2024 memorandum of understanding,” the geopolitical analyst said.\\nJulio Amador, the interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest and founder and trustee of the non-profit policy advisory firm FACTS Asia, called the agreement the “next step”.\\nIt creates a legal framework for ramping up military-to-military activities – including the annual Balikatan exercises with the US – which will benefit the Philippines’ armed forces and increase operability with Canada’s troops, according to him.\\n“A visiting forces agreement with Canada strengthens the Philippines’ network of partners on defence and military issues, and indicates that diplomatic and military cooperation is increasing and deepening,” he said.\\n\\n\\nAmador added that the agreement added to the Philippines’ potential deterrence strategy and showed that the country was “beginning to move beyond just exposing China’s belligerent behaviour”.\\n“When looking at the strategic environment from the South China Sea to the cross-straits, the [agreement] creates a partnership between the two countries that hints at alignment on how to respond to a China that is becoming more confident in flexing its muscles,” Amador said.\\nAway from Washington’s shadow\\nAnalysts say that the defence pact comes amid a fundamentally changed strategic environment, with the deal providing mutual benefits for both countries – particularly as Canada moves away from the shadow of the US in the region.\\n“When it comes to the security threats that the Philippines is facing, adding more defence partners is a critical component of, hopefully, a bigger strategy than what we are currently seeing right now,” Amador said.\\n“The [agreement} is an indication that the Philippines is actively identifying like-minded partners as it responds to a strategic environment that has fundamentally changed.”\\nMeanwhile, Gill called the Philippines “a natural partner for Canada” and one of the North American country’s anchors in its Indo-Pacific strategy, which it launched in 2022. Ottawa has committed C$2.3 billion (US$1.6 billion) over five years to developing its security engagement in the region.\\n\\nChester Cabalza, founder and president of the think tank International Development Security and Cooperation, said that the “Philippines’ like-minded friends” such as Canada were “all in a hurry to strike a defence deal while the iron is hot”.\\n“Both Ottawa and Manila are enjoying the momentum as Canadians and Filipinos lead the marathon on international rules-based order,” he said.\\nCabalza pointed out that the Philippines has benefited from Canada’s satellite-powered dark vessel detection programme used in the West Philippine Sea, Manila’s exclusive economic zone within the South China Sea, to detect ships from the China Coast Guard and maritime militia that have “gone dark” or turned off their automatic identification system trackers.\\nCanada had “made a name for itself as a trusted, functional security partner of the Philippines”, Gill said.\\n“Our security relationship with Ottawa took off in a relatively short amount of time. Within just two years, we were able to accomplish so much in terms of broadening and deepening our security partnership,” he said, referring to the dark vessel detection programme support and the joint sail activities between both countries.\\nHowever, Gill added that naval exercises should not be the primary cornerstone of the security partnership between both countries, and stressed that other areas should be highlighted and leveraged, such as cyber defence.\\n“Canada has a very robust experience in cyber defence and the cybersecurity threats that the Philippines continues to ... face on a daily basis. Canada is a natural partner in this regard, and I think that we have much to tap and maximise when it comes to our cybersecurity cooperation,” he said.\\n\\nShipbuilding was another strong point for the partnership, Gill said, adding that Canada could play a role in the imparting of technology, technical cooperation, and skills-building as Manila looks to strengthen its shipbuilding capabilities.\\nMeanwhile, Manila can serve as a gateway for Ottawa to further deepen its engagement in the region, with the Philippines seen as “one of the success stories of Canada’s Indo-Pacific strategy”, Gill said.\\n“By improving its security relations to the Philippines, this could eventually be a stepping stone for other countries in the region. We’ve seen Canada and Indonesia sign their first-ever bilateral free trade agreement,” he said.\\n“So we see how Canada has also been perceived more positively in the region, away from the common misconception that Canada is basically just a reflection or shadow of the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific. Canada has clearly shown great agency, and this is something that would benefit its objectives in the region as it seeks to diversify its security and economic partners as well.”\\n",

            "title": "Fate of thousands feared in Sudan’s Darfur after reported rampage by paramilitaries",
            "description": "Sudanese fleeing a paramilitary force that seized a city in the country’s Darfur region trickled into a nearby refugee camp on Thursday after walking for miles, telling aid workers that roads were littered with bodies. Aid groups feared for the fate of thousands more trying to escape, with hundreds reportedly killed in the turmoil.\\nThe UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting on Sudan amid international alarm over the bloodshed. UN officials have warned of a rampage by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces after it took over the city of El-Fasher, reportedly killing more than 450 people in a hospital and carrying out ethnically targeted killings of civilians and sexual assaults.\\nSpeaking at the meeting, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher criticised the Security Council for not acting sooner in Sudan. The country has been torn for the past two years by a war between the military and the RSF that has killed more than 40,000 people and left more than 14 million displaced.\\n“Can anyone here say we did not know this was coming?” he said. “We cannot hear the screams, but as we sit here today the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”\\n\\nAs the US and others at the gathering called for an end to “external support” for the warring parties, Sudan’s representative accused the United Arab Emirates, a top American ally, of backing the RSF. The Gulf nation has denied reports it provides weapons and funding to the paramilitary forces. A UN panel of experts in 2024 said it found the reports credible.\\nThe RSF had been besieging El-Fasher, the last military-held stronghold in the Darfur region, for the past 500 days. Its capture raised fears that Africa’s third-largest nation may split, with the paramilitaries holding Darfur and the military holding the capital Khartoum and the north and east of the country.\\nThe UN migration agency said over 36,000 have reportedly fled El-Fasher since Sunday, with people fleeing on foot in the middle of the night. Experts analysing satellite imagery say an earthen wall built by the RSF around the city was preventing residents from fleeing and has become a “kill box” where some appear to have been shot.\\nOnly thousands have arrived at Tawila, a town some 60km (35 miles) west of El-Fasher. Tawila has already burgeoned into a sprawling refugee camp housing hundreds of thousands who fled the RSF’s siege of El-Fasher over the past year.\\nMathilde Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which manages the camp, said the small number reaching Tawila “should be a concern for all of us … That tells the horror of the journey”.\\nThe new arrivals told aid workers that there were arbitrary killings by RSF along the roads, which were littered with bodies, the International Rescue Committee said. Save the Children said arriving women described hiding with their children in trenches or abandoned buildings inside El-Fasher to escape fighters, then being attacked and robbed by armed men as they left the city.\\n\\nVu said the vast majority of those arriving in Tawila were women, or families headed by women, as well as large numbers of children separated from their parents. Some among the arrivals were injured, many were malnourished.\\nSome women reported rapes as they fled, Vu said.\\n“Men are just not arriving. Either they were killed, disappeared or lost along the way,” she said.\\nIn Tawila, the newly displaced sheltered under trees. One woman, Aisha Ismael, said she arrived barefoot with none of her belongings amid constant drone attacks and shelling. People foraged for livestock fodder known as ambaz, which is made from peanut shells and water, because they were so hungry.\\n“We looked for it in the dirt to eat and they didn’t even let us. If they catch us, they hit us and throw it away,” she said.\\nDisrupted communications around El-Fasher has made assessing the devastation inside the city difficult. Witnesses told Associated Press that RSF fighters went from house to house, beating and shooting people, including women and children.\\n\\n🚨HUMAN SECURITY EMERGENCY🚨\\nDay 2: RSF continues mass killings in El Fasher: @HRL_YaleSPH finds evidence of mass killings at RSF-controlled former Children’s Hospital, Saudi Hospital and along the berm.#KeepEyesOnSudan\\n🛰️@AirbusSpace @Maxarhttps://t.co/1HApllgNL5 pic.twitter.com/g9KmBLhjH0\\n— Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) at YSPH (@HRL_YaleSPH) October 29, 2025\\n\\nSome 460 patients and their companions were reportedly killed on Tuesday at the Saudi Hospital in El-Fasher, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization.\\nThe RSF on Thursday denied carrying out killings at the hospital. It said it had arrested a number of individuals accused of committing violations during the seizure of El-Fasher.\\nThe Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said satellite imagery from Airbus corroborated alleged killings by the RSF around the Saudi Hospital. It also analysed images of a children’s hospital that the RSF turned into a detention centre months ago and found “a pile consistent with human remains” in the yard.\\n“We think those are people who were killed at the detention centre,” the lab’s executive director Nathaniel Raymond said.\\nThe Yale researchers also said that “systematic killings” took place in the vicinity of the earthen wall, which the RSF built outside the city earlier this year.\\n“The entire city is surrounded by a berm. It is a kill box, to trap them, to kill them,” said Raymond.\\n\\nAt the Security Council gathering, US ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea condemned “the horrific violence occurring in El-Fasher”. She repeated Washington’s stance that the RSF and its allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan.\\nShe said American officials are working to secure “an immediate humanitarian truce and halting external support” for the violence in Sudan.\\nThe military - which opponents say is linked to Sudanese Islamist groups - and the RSF were previously allies in ruling Sudan, until they fell out in a struggle for power in 2003. Both sides have faced allegations of human rights abuses.\\nBut rights groups and the United Nations have accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of repeated mass killings of civilians and widespread rapes, mainly targeting non-Arab communities. The RSF is largely made up of fighters from the Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in the early 2000s in Darfur.\\nEgypt, where the military dominates the government, gives political backing to the Sudanese military, seeing it as a more reliable ally in the neighbouring nation.\\nThe UAE is reported to back the RSF, similar to its support of armed factions in Libya and Yemen to spread its influence and combat Islamist groups. It has repeatedly denied allegations that it funnels weapons to the RSF. But in January 2024, the UN-appointed Panel of Experts for Sudan detailed reports of cargo planes believed to carry weapons destined for the RSF through neighbouring Chad and called the reports credible.\\nDuring Thursday’s session, the UAE’s representative to the UN, Mohamed Abushahab, said the Gulf state stands in “solidarity” with the Sudanese people and announced US$100 million in humanitarian aid.\\nSudan’s UN ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed accused the UAE of waging a “war of aggression” in Sudan with its support of the RSF and criticised the Security Council for failing to take “any practical measures to hold this particular sponsor and others accountable”.\\n",
