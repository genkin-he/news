            "description": "The World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed on Thursday it was looking into a leak about an investigation that resulted in the agency clearing 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\\nThe agency has defended its decision to clear the swimmers of doping. It said it had agreed with Chinese anti-doping authorities who found the swimmers’ samples were contaminated.\\nThe existence of the investigation by China and Wada had been kept under wraps before the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported on it last year.\\nARD reported on Wednesday that the agency was looking for the person who tipped off the news media about the investigation. The move is unusual because Wada encourages and relies on whistle-blowers to root out doping.\\nGünter Younger, director of intelligence and investigations at Wada, confirmed it had launched Operation Puncture to learn about the leak, but denied it was looking for the person who blew the whistle.\\n\\n“We’re not chasing the whistle-blower,” Younger told reporters at a media event in London. “What we want to try to find out is how the leak happened and what was the motivation of the leak.”\\nYounger touted the agency’s strong whistle-blower protections and said it was policy not to reveal ongoing investigations to protect those who may unfairly be accused of drug use.\\nHe said he believed the leak was politically motivated and he wanted to prevent that from happening again, but would not do anything to endanger the whistle-blower.\\nThe Chinese swimming case has been a flashpoint of controversy in sport and Wada has been criticised by athletes, sports governing bodies and groups dedicated to fighting the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\\nAmong the biggest critics have been anti-doping and government leaders in the United States, where the government has refused to pay its annual dues to Wada worth more than US$3.6 million.\\n",

            "title": "Thailand’s million-dollar gold heist reveals costly price of peace in insurgency-hit south",
            "description": "A million-dollar gold heist in Thailand’s far south by armed robbers who blocked roads with spikes and set explosives to seal their escape across the Malaysian border has rattled the Thai security establishment, as efforts to reignite peace talks in an area roiled by insurgency continue to fall flat.\\nAround 20 men working in three teams carried out the October 5 theft from a gold shop in Sungai Kolok, bordering Malaysia’s Kelantan State.\\nThe theft of hundreds of gold ornaments and jewellery valued at 35 million baht (US$1.08 million) came as prices for the precious metal spiked to historic highs of over US$4,200 per 28 grams (one ounce) earlier this month.\\nUsing two stolen getaway trucks, the robbers planted road spikes and explosives to obstruct police pursuit in a heist so well oiled that Thai authorities immediately attributed it to the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN).\\n\\nTwo days after the hold-up, Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit said the alleged BRN operatives had already smuggled the gold out of Thailand and that efforts to recover it would require “cross-border cooperation”, without naming Malaysia specifically.\\nThe BRN is the primary separatist movement controlling combatants in Thailand’s Malay-Muslim majority south.\\nA shadowy, underground movement, the BRN has led the rebellion against control by Bangkok. It accuses the Thai state of widespread abuses and of railroading the south’s unique Malay culture as well as trying to tip the demographic balance away from the Muslim population by moving in Buddhist settlers from the poor northeast of the country.\\nThe BRN typically neither confirms nor denies involvement in violent or criminal incidents, but its cells have in the past been accused of targeting civilians.\\nViolence as resistance\\nThe gold heist follows a spike in violence this year, including 88 deaths linked to the rebellion, according to conflict monitor Deep South Watch.\\n“The violence is a form of resistance; even the recent gold heist needs to be understood in those terms,” Asmadee Bueraheng, a Pattani-based writer and long-time conflict observer, told This Week in Asia.\\n“BRN combatants are protesting the Thai economic system, which they see as unfair, the policy of assimilation, which Malay Muslims reject because it comes at the expense of their religious identity, and the government’s transmigration policy, which they see as outside settlers occupying and taking away their land.”\\nAn insurgency has blistered across Thailand’s southernmost provinces for over two decades, claiming more than 7,700 lives. Many of those killed were civilians caught in shootings and bomb attacks by rebels as well as assaults by Thai forces.\\nThe BRN has been engaging in on-again, off-again peace talks to the Thai government since 2013. Mediated by Malaysia, the discussions have sputtered. Successive Thai governments have shown little political will to resolve the conflict as concessions to the Malays of Patani are deemed costly politically.\\n\\nAfter decades of grinding stalemate, the BRN’s current leadership has shown a willingness to compromise. Three years ago, the group agreed to negotiate under the terms of the Thai constitution, which explicitly states the country is “inseparable”. This apparent softening of its stance for a separate state makes it easier for talks to take place.\\n“Ultimately, we aim to establish a power-sharing system that guarantees justice, autonomy and recognition of Patani’s distinct identity,” the spokesman for the BRN’s negotiation team, Nikmatulla bin Seri said, using the Malay spelling for the kingdom colonised by Thailand over a century ago.\\nBut talks are often undercut by violence that, once unleashed, takes on a dynamic of its own.\\nIn April, Thai security forces killed senior BRN member Abdulroning Lateh, a battle-hardened 60-year-old who helped nurture the current generation of combatants that resurfaced in January 2004. In response, his followers hit civilian and military targets, culminating in the May 2 killing of four civilians, including a nine-year-old girl and a 76-year-old blind woman in Narathiwat province.\\nThe violence also threatens to spill outside the confines of the south. On June 11, improvised explosive devices were found in Krabi and Phuket – two of Thailand’s top tourist destinations. Their locations were revealed by two suspected BRN operatives who confessed to planting them after they were caught.\\nInstability in Bangkok\\nThe lack of concrete progress on peace has been made worse by chronic instability in Bangkok, which has had three prime ministers in as many years. A potential election early next year is set to bring yet another government.\\nAfter the fall of successive Thai governments under Thaksin Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai party, hopes for peace talks to résumé and a political deal to the conflict have receded.\\nThe new short-term government of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has appointed a new chief negotiator for the deep south process, despite his government’s curtailed four-month tenure.\\nRetired general Somsak Rungsita, a former secretary general of the National Security Council, will lead the Malaysia-mediated talks.\\n\\n\\nHis task is urgent. If peace cannot be struck soon, future BRN leaders may be less accommodating, warns Artef Sokho of The Patani, a peace advocacy group which sometimes acts as a go-between with the rebels and the Thai side.\\n“BRN elders command a great deal of respect from their people,” he said. “Right now, they are willing to negotiate for a fair deal. But if and when these ageing leaders step down or pass away, I’m not so sure the next generation of leaders will be as accommodating.”\\nThai security chiefs have raised the prospect of reintroducing an emergency decree on swathes of the restive south, where it had been lifted as a confidence-building measure. Most of the region remains smothered under martial law and an emergency decree, permitting 30-day detentions without legal representation, which civil society groups say allows the state to round up civilians – including political activists – without charge or cause.\\nUntil those draconian powers are dropped, it will be impossible to negotiate, irrespective of who leads the Bangkok administration, conflict monitors warn.\\n“Setting up a team for the peace talks, along with bringing in an outsider to command over this region, is meaningless because these controversial laws and harassments are still in place,” Asmadee said.\\n",

            "title": "Growing rice in the UK ‘not so crazy’ as climate warms",
            "description": "Wearing large rubber boots, Nadine Mitschunas joyfully handled mature rice plants peeking through the water of her small plot growing in the fertile soil of eastern England.\\nGrowing rice “has not been done before in the UK”, said Mitschunas, a field ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (UKCEH).\\nBut as temperatures warm due to climate change, “it’s not such a crazy idea because it seems to work”, she added.\\nAs rice grows in eastern England, lemon groves and chickpeas were also cropping up in the south.\\nA warmer climate and changing rainfall patterns have made planning ahead essential, and British researchers are embarking on a journey of agricultural transformation.\\n\\nMitschunas is leading research with a project that tests new crops in the flat Fens of Cambridgeshire by rewetting peatlands.\\nIts rich soil has facilitated high production levels, and the region now cultivates one third of England’s vegetables and 20 per cent of its potatoes and beetroots.\\nBut soil drainage gradually impoverishes the land, posing a threat to local farmers and releasing the CO2 captured by the peatland which are important carbon sinks.\\nCraig and Sarah-Jane Taylor, the landowners participating in the UKCEH scheme, were conscious of the issue.\\n“We recognise that our soils are depleting and that we need to change to secure the future,” said Sarah-Jane Taylor, underlining the question of “water availability... and that’s only going to get worse”.\\nThe United Kingdom, like the rest of the world, has been affected by climate change. It now has to contend with more frequent extreme weather, rising temperatures, and drier soil in some areas.\\n\\nA recent UKCEH study suggested that the growth of popular crops such as wheat and strawberries would become much more difficult over the coming decades if the climate warmed by 2 degrees Celsius. If temperatures rise by 4 degrees, onion and oat crops would be hit.\\nOn the other hand, crops such as sunflower, durum wheat, soybean, chickpeas, lemon and okra could become more viable, particularly in southwestern England or near the Scottish coast.\\nChina and India are the world’s leading producers of rice.\\nAnd in the Fens, Mitschunas has tested nine rice varieties regularly grown in the United States, the Philippines, Macedonia and Japan - four of them show promise, particularly one that originates from Colombia.\\nOnce the grains germinated in a laboratory, the seedlings were planted in water in June, and harvesting began in early October.\\n“I am not eating my own rice yet,” the ecologist joked. But such a scenario could become a reality within 10 years.\\n“The suitable climate for rice is moving more northwards” in Europe, she said, pointing to successful initiatives in the Netherlands and Germany.\\nMitschunas is also testing everything from lettuce and celery to pumpkins and strawberries - and even aromatic plants.\\nAlong with crop experimentation, her project aims to regenerate peatlands and improve the country’s CO2-capturing capacities.\\nShe is not the only British researcher testing new crops.\\nAt the University of Southampton in southern England, professor of biological sciences Mark Chapman is leading a study on different crops, including chickpea cultivation.\\n“If we wait until 20 or 30 years, and then realise that we can’t grow wheat... like we always have done, we’ve then got (a) problem,” he said.\\nHe emphasised the need to “smooth the transition” by prioritising which future crops to grow and ensuring consumers are ready to change their habits.\\n“I think we’re at that point where we just need to try more things,” he said. “We need to get farmers involved, who are actually going to plant the crops.”\\nThe pioneers in the Fens, Sarah-Jane and Craig Taylor, have noted other farmers’ growing interest in the project following their initial surprise.\\n“Once upon a time potatoes and sugar beet weren’t grown here and now they’re one of the main crops in the area,” said Sarah-Jane Taylor.\\n“So why couldn’t rice potentially be an option here? And why shouldn’t we look at it?”\\n",

            "title": "Idle Hong Kong seafront site gets new lease of life from private equity firm MBK Partners",
            "description": "A mega waterfront commercial site in Hong Kong’s Quarry Bay that has been left idle for nearly two decades by a now-bankrupt local businessman may finally be poised for a revival.\\nThe current owner, Marine Riches, majority owned by South Korean private equity group MBK Partners, had applied to amend plans for the site to the Town Planning Board – a move that came amid signs of recovery in Hong Kong’s retail sector and property market.\\nMarine Riches proposed to build a mixed-use development focusing on culture and tourism alongside a residential project, according to the minutes of a meeting released by the Harbourfront Commission on Friday. The meeting was aimed at seeking views of commission members on a section 12A application, which is used to propose changes to land use.\\nThe seafront site, comprising two plots totalling 91,838 sq ft on Hoi Yu Street, has undergone multiple planning revisions since the early 2000s. The plots were acquired for HK$1 billion (US$128 million) in June 2024, according to Land Registry records.\\n\\nThe plots were originally approved as industrial lots in 2001, with the first landlord, Fine Tower Associates – an entity connected to Pacific Concord Holdings – securing approval to construct a 25-storey industrial building, according to official records.\\nBusinessman Wong Sai-chung was the chairman of Pacific Concord, a Hong Kong-listed company from 1987 to 2003, and the managing director of the now-liquidated property developer China Properties Group, which delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2023.\\nFine Tower envisioned constructing an “Old Hong Kong” theme park – featuring replicas of historic architecture from Central, Wan Chai and Happy Valley – after learning that the site could be rezoned from industrial use to cultural, leisure and tourism uses. Its application submitted to the Town Planning Board was turned down in September 2003, according to the Post’s previous reporting.\\nFollowing the setback, the site remained idle for years, used only as temporary car parks.\\nIn 2017, Fine Tower began foundation work for the development of an industrial building but public pressure mounted to repurpose the site in line with a harbourfront boardwalk vision.\\nIn 2021, the Chief Executive in Council approved an in-situ land exchange to allow for a new development comprising one office block and four hotel blocks with a total of 400 rooms on top of a two-storey retail podium. Fine Tower, however, was already facing financial difficulties before the exchange was completed.\\nThe site was valued at HK$4 billion when it was put up for tender by creditors in 2022. Marine Riches purchased the plots in June 2024.\\nUnder the new amendment application, more than half of the total cultural, leisure and tourism spaces would be dedicated to a large-scale, privately owned immersive exhibition venue in Hong Kong. Marine Riches said it had secured a content partnership deal with Neon Global, a creator of immersive shows featuring popular intellectual properties – like Harry Potter, Marvel Avengers and Jurassic World – in Asia and across the world.\\nUpon completion, the development was expected to attract around 5,000 visitors daily, on par with the Hong Kong Palace Museum and the M+ Museum, the application said.\\n\\nThe project would integrate residential, retail and dining spaces – creating a new hub for residents and visitors – and directly supported the city’s priorities to boost tourism, expand cultural infrastructure, foster creative industries and provide quality housing and public space, according to the application.\\nThe application coincides with a rebound in Hong Kong’s retail sales, which saw a 3.8 per cent year-on-year increase in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of growth, aided by the city’s mega-event tourism drive.\\nThe city’s residential property market also showed signs of improvement, with lived-in home prices rising 1.3 per cent in September, their biggest gains so far this year. The city’s rental prices, at the same time, inched within a hair of their historical peak, according to data from the Rating and Valuation Department.\\nMarine Riches would also be partnering with a local developer, according to a source familiar with the matter. It was too early to disclose a construction timeline, the source added.\\nMBK did not respond to a request for comment.\\nMBK, founded in 2005 and focusing on investment in North Asia, had over US$30 billion in assets under management, according to its website. Among its notable deals was a buyout of Universal Studios Japan, one of Asia’s largest theme parks, for US$1.4 billion in 2009. It sold all of its stakes to Comcast NBCUniversal in 2017, according to media reports.\\nIt also bought five maritime theme parks in mainland China from Hong Kong-listed hospitality group Haichang Ocean Park Holdings for 6.05 billion yuan (US$843 million) in 2021.\\n",

            "description": "After two decades of anticipation and countless delays, the Grand Egyptian Museum is finally having its grand reveal.\\nThe museum, which was set to officially open on Saturday, highlights Egypt’s ancient civilisation and is a centrepiece of the government’s drive to boost the tourist industry, a major source of foreign currency in the cash-strapped country.\\nLocated just outside Cairo next to the famed Giza Pyramids, the US$1 billion mammoth facility is poised to become the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilisation with over 50,000 artefacts detailing life in ancient Egypt. By comparison, the Louvre Museum in Paris has about 35,000 pieces on display.\\nThe museum is one of the mega-projects championed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who since taking office in 2014 embarked on massive investments in infrastructure with the aim of reviving an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered by the unrest that followed the 2011 Arab spring uprising.\\n\\nThe museum’s construction began in 2005, but work stopped for three years during the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising.\\nThe grand opening was postponed multiple times, most recently in July this year because of conflicts in the Middle East. World leaders were expected to attend the opening ceremony on Saturday.\\nDesigned by the Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects, the museum, known as GEM, boasts a towering, triangular glass façade imitating the nearby pyramids.\\nIn its entrance atrium stands the granite colossus of one of Egypt’s most famed pharaohs, Ramesses the Great. The 3,200-year-old, 11-metre-tall statue was moved to the museum after decades of standing in the centre of a traffic-clogged roundabout in front of Cairo’s main railway station.\\nFrom the atrium, a grand six-storey staircase lined with ancient statues leads up to the main galleries and a view of the nearby pyramids. A bridge links the museum to the pyramids, allowing tourists to move between them either on foot or via electric, environment-friendly vehicles, according to museum officials.\\nThe museum includes 258,000 sq ft of permanent exhibition space, a children’s museum and conference and educational facilities, and a commercial area as well as a large conservation centre.\\n\\nThe 12 main galleries, which opened last year, exhibit antiquities spanning from prehistoric times to the Roman era, organised by era and by themes.\\nMany of the 50,000 artefacts in the GEM were moved from the Egyptian Museum, a packed, century-old building in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Others were recently unearthed from ancient cemeteries, including the Saqqara necropolis, another complex of pyramids and tombs about 22km (14 miles) south of the museum.\\nThe halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations including mixed-reality shows to help explain ancient Egypt to new generations, said Ahmed Ghoneim, the museum’s CEO.\\n“We’re using the language that the Gen Z uses right now,” he said in an interview. “Gen Z doesn’t use any more the labels that we read as old people but rather use technology.”\\nSaturday’s grand opening would include the inauguration of two halls dedicated to the 5,000 artefacts from the collection of King Tutankhamun.\\nThe collection was being displayed in its entirety for the first time since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered King Tut’s tomb in 1922 in the southern city of Luxor. The old Egyptian Museum did not have enough space to show all the tomb’s treasures at once.\\n\\nSome masterpieces were restored at the museum’s conservation centre, including the boy pharaoh’s three funeral beds and six chariots, said Jailan Mohamed, chief restorer at the conservation centre.\\nThey will be displayed along with his golden throne, his gold-covered sarcophagus and his burial mask, made of gold, quartzite, lapis lazuli and coloured glass. The mask’s beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued back on with epoxy in 2014, before a German-Egyptian team of experts fixed it the following year.\\nAnother centrepiece of the museum was the 4,600-year-old solar boat of King Khufu, the pharaoh who was credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza.\\nThe 43-metre-long wooden boat, discovered in the 1950s, was buried next to the Great Pyramid for Khufu - or Cheops as he was also known - to use in the afterlife. In 2021, it was moved from its display site by the pyramids into the Grand Egyptian Museum on a remote-controlled vehicle imported from Belgium.\\nThe government hoped the museum would draw more tourists and provide the foreign currency Egypt needed to shore up its economy.\\nThe tourism sector suffered from years of political turmoil and violence following the 2011 Arab spring uprising. In recent years, the sector has started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are a major source of tourists visiting Egypt.\\nA record number of 15.7 million visited the country in 2024, according to official figures, and the government aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2032.\\nAuthorities overhauled the whole area around the museum and the pyramids. Roads were paved and a metro station is being constructed outside the museum gates to ease access to the sites. An airport, Sphinx International Airport, was also opened west of Cairo - 40 minutes from the museum.\\nHassan Allam, CEO of Hassan Allam Holding, the firm operating the museum, said they were expecting between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors a day at the museum.\\n“The world has been waiting … Everyone’s excited,” he said.\\n",

            "title": "Chinese medicinal wines still have a place in TCM, treating arthritis, period pain and more",
            "description": "It might sound like the stuff of nightmares: Chinese medicinal shop shelves lined with jars containing snakes and lizards pickled in a murky mix of liquid and herbs. But they serve a healthy purpose.\\nChinese medicinal wines have been around for almost as long as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) itself.\\nTo make them, snakes, geckos and other creatures are steeped in alcohol for months or years, along with herbs, to extract their perceived medicinal “essence”. They are used as powerful tonics to treat ailments from rheumatism to arthritis, and to boost male vitality by warming the body and promoting blood circulation.\\nThe popularity of Chinese medicinal wines in Hong Kong has waned since their heyday in the 1970s and ’80s, when mainland Chinese varieties such as Shi Quan Da Bu Jiu – “the 10 complete wellness wine” – were household names.\\n\\nHong Kong-based TCM practitioner Samuel To Ching-san cites several reasons for their fall in popularity.\\n“In the last few decades, alcohol has been seen as something detrimental to your health; you can’t be taking medicinal wines before driving or before work, and preparing Chinese medicinal wines takes time, something that modern lifestyles have less and less of,” he says.\\nBut according to To, it is the wines’ alcohol content that helps make them fast-acting and effective.\\n“Alcohol acts as a conduit, directing medicinal effects and helping the medicine reach the affected area quickly,” he says. “It also has a synergistic effect, dissolving the active components of herbs into the wine,” making it easier for the patient to absorb them.\\nTo adds, however, that Chinese medicinal wines’ efficacy is only relative to other forms of TCM; “the speed of modern medicine has left this advantage in the dust”.\\n\\nBrewing medicinal wines and elixirs has been part of Chinese culture for almost 2,000 years. Ancient oracle bones from the Shang dynasty (1600BC-1046BC) reveal the earliest uses of wine in rituals and medicine.\\nDuring the Han (206BC-AD220) and Jin (265-420) dynasties, Taoist alchemists concocted mystical elixirs in their quest for immortality, sometimes with dangerous results. They used cinnabar – a toxic ore of mercury – and rare minerals in medicinal wines.\\nLater, in the Tang (618-907) dynasty, Sun Simiao, known as China’s king of medicine, refined wine-based remedies for ailments ranging from fatigue to arthritis, recording the recipes in texts that would endure for centuries.\\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese doctor Li Shizhen catalogued hundreds of tonics infused with everything from ginseng to wolfberries and even snake in his book, Bencao Gangmu, or the Compendium of Materia Medica, enshrining their use in Chinese medicine.\\nSnake wines are on the list of Hong Kong’s intangible cultural heritage. To make them, the defanged animals are gutted and then steamed and immersed in spirits such as yellow wine with medicinal herbs.\\nThe wine is aged for one to two years and is said to be good for “expelling wind and dampness”. In TCM, wind and dampness are related to joint and muscle pain, stiffness and swelling. Removing them from the body is also believed to boost core energy, strength and overall vitality.\\n\\nDepending on the combination of ingredients, medicinal wines can help with a variety of ailments related to the circulatory system, from rheumatism and joint pain to period pain, indigestion and cold hands and feet.\\nSnakes and lizards are not a necessary ingredient for these wines; many of them are infused with ingredients such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, safflower, goji berries and ginseng.\\nTo says that, because of the alcoholic nature of wine therapy, there are several things to keep in mind.\\n“People who are taking sleeping pills, antidepressants, antibiotics, anticoagulants, oral antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensives and even painkillers should not use wine therapy,” he warns.\\n“Sometimes it could worsen the condition; it’s best to consult your prescribing doctor to see if they can be taken together,” he adds.\\n\\nSince wine therapy usually needs to be taken over time, To suggests taking small shots daily.\\n“There are different ABVs [alcohol levels] when it comes to medicinal wines. Patients shouldn’t take more than 30ml a day for the stronger ones and no more than 50ml a day for the milder wines,” To says.\\n“It’s better to drink the wine after meals and not on an empty stomach, and if you’re taking it for wellness reasons such as warming up cold hands and feet, then I suggest drinking it in alternating weeks, such as one week on and one week off.”\\nTo also says that it is difficult to control medicinal wines’ potency.\\n“Depending on the length of time that it’s been infused and the quality of the herbs used, it is hard to gauge the efficacy of the wines. In contrast, it is a lot easier to gauge the effects of herbal medicine and acupuncture.”\\nDespite these caveats, To still believes that medicinal wine therapy has a place in TCM.\\n“It has fallen out of favour in recent years, but it is the best therapy for certain conditions if used correctly. We should not forget this part of TCM culture.”\\nLike what you read? Follow SCMP Lifestyle on Facebook, X and Instagram. You can also sign up for our eNewsletter here.\\n",

            "description": "OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital will build a data centre campus of more than 1 gigawatt in Saline Township, Michigan, as part of their Stargate push to expand US artificial intelligence infrastructure capacity.\\nThe announcement made on Thursday underscores the AI industry’s surging appetite for computing power, driven by the pursuit of technology capable of matching or surpassing human intelligence.\\nThe companies said it was a multibillion-dollar investment, without disclosing the exact figure. Industry executives have said 1GW of computing power, enough to power roughly 750,000 US homes, can cost around US$50 billion.\\nThe construction is slated to begin in early 2026.\\nThe project is part of Oracle and OpenAI’s 4.5-GW Stargate expansion and, together with six other US sites, raises the infrastructure group’s planned capacity to more than 8GW and total investment to over US$450 billion in the next three years.\\nOpenAI said the move kept Stargate ahead of schedule to meet its US$500 billion, 10GW commitment. The start-up has shared few details on how it plans to fund the spending.\\n\\nEarlier this week, it completed a restructuring that frees the ChatGPT maker to move away from its nonprofit roots. Reuters has reported it was laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to US$1 trillion.\\nBut surging valuations of AI companies and their massive AI spending commitments, which total more than US$1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom is inflating into a bubble.\\nOpenAI said on Thursday Related Digital would develop the Michigan project, which is expected to create more than 2,500 union construction jobs.\\n“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice-president of industrial compute.\\n",
