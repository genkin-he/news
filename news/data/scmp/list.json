            "title": "Hong Kong’s higher stamp duty will not stop luxury homebuyers from China",
            "description": "The increase in stamp duty on ultra-luxury homes above HK$100 million (US$12.8 million) is unlikely to change buying behaviour, analysts said, as the structural forces underpinning demand from mainland Chinese buyers could outweigh the impact of the rise in transaction costs.\nThe Hong Kong government, in the annual budget on Wednesday, increased the tax rate on residential transactions above HK$100 million to 6.5 per cent from 4.25 per cent amid a surge in demand for high-end property from mainland buyers.\nProperty agents said the 2.25 percentage-point rise in transaction costs would not significantly impact mainland Chinese demand. They added that the authorities were likely seeking to prevent overheating before momentum accelerates further in the trophy-home segment.\n“The government saw a sudden increase in large-ticket transactions this year, which signals returning confidence,” said Louis Ho Siu-tong, senior associate director at Centaline Property covering The Peak and the Southern district. “They do not want prices to rise too quickly.”\n\nThe move came as mainland Chinese purchasers accounted for about 80 per cent of HK$100 million-plus transactions in prime districts this year, according to Centaline. A total of 48 such deals worth HK$10.4 billion were completed year-to-date as of Wednesday, Centaline said. There were a total of 262 transactions worth HK$53.1 billion in 2025.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech that buyers with “greater financial means” should “contribute more”, expecting to raise about HK$1 billion annually from the higher stamp duty.\nThe broader housing market has also started to show signs of stabilisation. Lived-in home prices rose 3.66 per cent in 2025, ending three consecutive years of decline.\nPrices of larger homes measuring at least 1,076 sq ft gained 2.93 per cent last year, though they remain about 19 per cent below their October 2021 peak. In January, 26 such deals worth HK$5.3 billion were recorded, up 70 per cent in volume and 50 per cent in value from a month earlier, according to Centaline.\nThe stronger-than-expected property market momentum has prompted global investment banks to cluster around a more bullish view for 2026, with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs joining Morgan Stanley in projecting double-digit gains.\nJoseph Tsang, chairman of JLL in Hong Kong, said January’s spike partly reflected several ultra-large transactions, including Swire Properties’ HK$2.6 billion sale of two three-storey units at 6 Deep Water Bay Road to a buyer from the mainland.\n“The surge somewhat coincided with a few big-ticket deals,” Tsang said, cautioning against reading the figures as a straight-line trend.\nThe Hong Kong dollar’s relative weakness has made local assets appear cheaper for yuan-based buyers. Mortgage rates have also eased in recent months, reducing financing costs.\nMore fundamentally, Tsang said, wealthy mainland individuals increasingly viewed Hong Kong property as a means of allocating capital within an internationally connected financial system, where proceeds could be held and redeployed offshore with greater flexibility.\n“There is a clear desire to place their assets in a market with an internationally connected financial system,” he said.\nRecent transactions illustrate the strength of demand. Earthstone paid HK$323 million for a 4,566 sq ft flat at Mount Nicholson, about 3.5 per cent higher than its previous sale price in 2016. Company filings showed Fu Songyang, founder of Beijing-based luxury-car dealer FFF-Automobile, was a director of the purchasing company.\nIn another deal, Alphabase Investments acquired a four-bedroom unit at The Legacy in Mid-Levels West for HK$158 million. Land Registry records identified Yuan Yuwei, a director of the acquiring entity, as the buyer.\nGiven these drivers, property agents said the higher stamp duty might have a limited impact.\n“Mainlanders were buying luxury homes even when there was a 30 per cent tax,” said Centaline’s Ho, referring to the additional duties that were scrapped in 2024. “They will definitely buy now.”\n",

            "description": "A Hong Kong doctor and a clinic operator were arrested on Thursday in a joint operation by police and health authorities on a Causeway Bay medical facility suspected of performing high-risk hair transplant procedures without a valid licence.\nAuthorities raided the clinic located in the Cameron Commercial Centre on Hennessy Road after receiving a tip-off that it was offering Regenera Activa (RGA) – an autologous cell transplant treatment for hair loss – despite not having the required day procedure centre licence.\nDuring the operation, officers seized medical devices and instruments that could be used for RGA procedures along with patient records, and arrested a doctor and the person in charge of the clinic.\n“The doctor involved is suspected of performing high-risk medical procedures on premises without an appropriate licence, thereby failing to act in the best interests of patients,” a Department of Health spokesman said.\n\n“The investigation is ongoing, and prosecution will be considered based on the evidence collected,” he said, adding the case has been referred to the Medical Council.\nRGA is a hair regrowth treatment that uses a patient’s own cells to stimulate thinning hair. During the process, a doctor extracts small micrografts – tiny skin samples just a few millimetres wide – from a healthy part of the scalp.\nThese samples are then ground down into a liquid and injected back into thinning areas to revitalise inactive hair follicles.\nThe department noted that the transplant of any cells or tissues is classified as a scheduled medical procedure that must by law be carried out at a licensed day procedure centre to ensure patient safety.\nUnder the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance, anyone found operating a day procedure centre without a valid licence faces a maximum penalty of HK$100,000 (US$12,786) and up to three years in jail.\nThe department said it issued a letter to all doctors earlier this month, reminding them to verify that a facility holds the required licence before performing RGA or any other regulated medical procedures to ensure practitioners strictly adhere to the professional code of conduct.\n“The Department of Health reiterates its appeal to the public that, before receiving RGA or other scheduled medical procedures stipulated in the ordinance, they should confirm if the premises had obtained a day procedure centre licence,” the spokesman said.\nEarlier this month, the Consumer Council revealed it receives about 100 complaints annually regarding hair-related services, including transplants, growth treatments and scalp care.\nThese cases often involved disputes over exaggerated results, scalp inflammation and the detachment of artificial hair strands, with many consumers facing significant financial losses, it said.\nThe watchdog urged the public to proactively inquire whether a treatment involves regulated medical procedures and to verify that the service provider holds the necessary professional qualifications.\n",

            "title": "Baidu touts AI chips’ potential amid sluggish fourth quarter",
            "description": "Baidu founder, CEO and chairman Robin Li Yanhong touted the performance and potential of artificial intelligence chips developed by its Kunlunxin semiconductor design unit during the fourth-quarter earnings call, offering a rare bright spot in an otherwise lacklustre quarter.\n“We’re proud to see the market increasingly recognise [Kunlunxin chips’] value and proven performance,” Li said on Thursday.\nThe Kunlunxin chips are built on a proprietary architecture and deliver “stable, high-performance AI computing at scale with broad compatibility across different [AI] models”, Li said, citing strong inference efficiency that has driven broad enterprise adoption across sectors including finance, telecommunications and energy.\nLi’s remarks come as Baidu reported revenue of 32.74 billion yuan (US$4.8 billion) for the fourth quarter, slightly above analysts’ estimates of 32.66 billion yuan, but down 4 per cent from a year earlier, highlighting how growth in the AI-related business was not enough to offset sluggish advertising demand.\n\nRevenue from its AI-related business for the three months ended December, which includes AI cloud, AI applications and AI marketing services, came in at more than 11 billion yuan, up 48 per cent from a year earlier, according to its earnings statement.\nLi said “2025 marked a pivotal year as AI became the new core of Baidu”, adding that the company was confident in “creating lasting value in the AI era”, the statement said.\nRevenue for the full year fell 3 per cent to 129.1 billion yuan.\nBaidu’s fourth-quarter and full-year performance was in line with analysts’ expectations. Analysts from Everbright Securities and China Securities said in research notes that they expected the company’s advertising operations to be weighed down by sluggish demand, while also noting that recent restructuring and investments into AI weighed on short-term revenue.\nIn November, Baidu axed an undisclosed number of jobs that affected some of its major divisions, including the mobile ecosystem group, which houses the bread-and-butter search business.\nIt also reorganised its AI model development operations, creating two separate units for foundational models and application models. The new units are responsible for the Ernie series foundational AI models, reporting directly to Baidu founder Li.\nThe Ernie Assistant’s monthly active users reached 202 million in December, according to the company.\nBaidu has been making active adjustments and investments on the consumer AI applications front, including joining its peers in doling out billions of yuan to promote AI assistants. Chinese tech giants and AI specialist start-ups are competing to build their AI chatbot apps as a gateway to the AI era.\nLast month, Baidu said that Kunlunxin had confidentially filed to list the unit in Hong Kong, riding on the wave of China’s tech-sufficiency push. Investors expect the move to “unlock value” for Baidu.\nBaidu unveiled two new chips from Kunlunxin at its annual developer and client event in November, including the M100, which has been designed to enhance inference efficiency in models using the mixture-of-experts technique, and the M300, tailored for training super-large multimodal models with trillions of parameters.\nThe M100 is set for release this year and the M300 in 2027, according to the company. The chips would provide “powerful, low-cost and controllable AI computing power” to support China’s AI self-sufficiency push, said Shen Dou, Baidu’s executive vice-president and president of its cloud unit.\nBaidu’s Apollo Go autonomous-ride hailing service also delivered an aggregated 20 million rides to the public as of this month, as it expands its global presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\nBaidu’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to close at HK$123.40 on Thursday.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong records HK$2.9 billion consolidated surplus for 2025-26. Here’s how",
            "description": "A combination of a strong initial public offering (IPO) market and bond sales has helped put Hong Kong’s financial health back in the black sooner than expected, with analysts expecting a robust pipeline of listings to be key to sustaining the city’s surplus.\nIn his budget speech on Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the city was previously expected to record a HK$67 billion deficit for the 2025-26 financial year, which ends on March 31, but emerged with an estimated HK$2.9 billion consolidated surplus.\nSome economists on Thursday expressed optimism regarding the outlook for 2026-27, pointing to factors such as the stabilised property market and the transfer of billions of Hong Kong dollars between government funds or accounts.\nBilly Mak Sui-choi, an associate professor at Baptist University’s accountancy, economics and finance department, attributed the operating surplus in 2025-26 directly to the bustling stock market, noting that robust turnover and listing activities were the primary engines for government revenue.\n“The main reason is that in the past year … Hong Kong stock turnover was much larger, so government stamp duty [revenue] increased by a lot, by tens of billions,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nLee Shu-kam, head of Hong Kong Shue Yan University’s economics and finance department, expressed optimism that a compounding effect from new companies coming to Hong Kong, a booming stock market and a recovering property sector would mutually reinforce one another to sustain higher tax revenues.\n“The future situation is relatively optimistic. This year, [the city’s financial health] was mainly supported by corporate profits and returns from the stock market, but if we can attract more companies to Hong Kong in the future, the result will naturally be even better,” he said.\n“If we see more start-ups joining the market, profits benefiting, and the stock market becoming more buoyant – and if the property sector improves amid this – tax revenue will see a compounding increase. The overall picture is optimistic.”\nThe strong IPOs showing gave rise to an estimated stamp duty revenue of HK$99.5 billion in 2025-26, HK$31.9 billion higher than previously thought. Similarly, profits tax revenue beat forecasts by HK$16.8 billion, reaching HK$209 billion.\nThe success of the new listings and strong stock trading also prompted a record profit for the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing two years in a row, with its net profit jumping by 36 per cent to HK$17.75 billion last year.\nThe exchange earlier reported that as of the end of January 2026, more than 400 companies were in the listing pipeline, representing a diverse sector spanning healthcare, materials, technology-media-telecoms and industrials.\nHong Kong finished 2025 as the world’s top venue for IPO fundraising, raising US$37.4 billion across 119 listings.\nRiding on the momentum, the financial secretary has also tasked the bourse with reviewing listing requirements to facilitate the listing of aerospace enterprises.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, bond sales were also a significant contributor to the consolidated surplus.\nThe government issued HK$155 billion in sustainable and infrastructure bonds in 2025-26, which were booked as revenue in the Capital Works Reserve Fund. Repayments for government bonds amounted to about HK$51.69 billion.\nWithout them, the consolidated account would have recorded a deficit of more than HK$100 billion due to heavy capital expenditure.\n“If looking purely at the accounts … one might think it is ‘cooking the books’ [to count debt as revenue],” Lee said. “But following the government’s definition, it is a surplus.”\nMak agreed the surplus figure involved “accounting techniques” but defended the rationale.\n“If you take the thousands of billions needed for the Northern Metropolis and book it all as expenditure in one year, you will definitely have a deficit,” Mak said. “But borrowing money to invest is a financing method, just like taking a mortgage to buy a flat.”\nThe financial secretary explicitly said the bond issuance programme would be expanded to an annual target of HK$160 billion to HK$220 billion for the next five years.\nConsequently, the debt-to-GDP level is projected to rise from 14.4 per cent to 19.9 per cent by 2030-31.\nLee emphasised that the legitimacy of this strategy hinged on how the funds were deployed.\n“Issuing bonds is not for paying civil servants’ salaries or welfare … If it were, that would be a huge problem,” he said. “But if it is used for transport infrastructure … then this bond issuance is completely fine.”\n\n\n\n\nFrench investment bank Natixis described the persistent financial deficit, masked by bond proceeds, as the “new norm” for Hong Kong.\nLooking ahead to 2026-27, the government forecasts a consolidated surplus of HK$22.1 billion, which is heavily buttressed by aggressive fund transfers.\nFor example, the government plans to transfer HK$75 billion in investment income from the Exchange Fund to the Capital Works Reserve Fund and HK$37 billion from the accumulated surplus of the Bond Fund back into government accounts.\nChristopher Hui Ching-yu, secretary for financial services and the treasury, defended the use of Exchange Fund proceeds, saying the transfer involved “extra investment income” rather than the principal capital required to defend the currency peg.\nHe said the debt-to-GDP proportion remained controllable compared with the level of other advanced economies.\nThe Exchange Fund, Hong Kong’s de facto sovereign wealth fund, is used to defend the US dollar currency peg and finance infrastructure development.\n",

            "title": "Residents of fire-ravaged Wang Fuk Court can retrieve belongings from late April",
            "description": "Hong Kong authorities have said that residents of fire-ravaged Wang Fuk Court will be allowed to return to their flats to collect personal belongings by late April – nearly five months after the city’s deadliest inferno in decades killed 168 people and displaced nearly 5,000 at the Tai Po estate.\nThe announcement came a day after more than 630 displaced homeowners petitioned the government for their “humble and urgent” wish to retrieve cherished possessions that were not destroyed in the blaze.\nDeputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk Wing-hing, who chairs the Wang Fuk Court support fund steering committee, said that residents from the seven fire-affected blocks could return by late April at the earliest, noting that the two-month preparatory period would prioritise safety, with access granted in stages.\n“The operation … must be conducted under safe conditions,” Cheuk told the city’s public broadcaster RTHK. “There are safety hazards. There are still some overhanging scaffolds on the exterior of the buildings and the interiors also have areas with severe damage, such as the ceilings, floors and walls.\n“It is a large-scale operation because it involves over 1,700 households. The difficulty level is also high, so we must carry out thorough deployment, extensive preliminary preparations and specific tasks for the day of the operation. Our current estimate is that it will take approximately two months to complete these tasks.”\nThe fire, which broke out on November 26 last year, tore through seven of the eight residential towers at the estate, killing 168 including a firefighter and displacing nearly 5,000 residents.\nResidents of Wang Chi House – the only block spared from the blaze – were given a brief two-day window in December to enter their flats and retrieve essential items for 90 minutes each.\nTo support residents who may be emotionally overwhelmed, Cheuk said the government would arrange for police officers and social workers or psychologists to accompany them into the building, while urging them to take only a reasonable number of items.\n“As the lifts are out of service, residents will have to be selective,” he said, adding that valuable, sentimental or portable items would be easier to remove, but “quantities must remain reasonable”.\n“A home can hold a vast amount of items – for instance, there may be large electrical appliances – but in these conditions, moving these larger objects simply won’t be possible,” he said.\nCheuk noted that elderly owners might struggle to reach homes on higher floors and said the government would provide social workers paired with each household photographs of severely damaged flats to help owners decide whether to return.\nBut he stressed that all residents would still have the right to retrieve their belongings.\nA 40-year-old resident surnamed Fong, who lived in a high-floor flat in Wang Cheong House with his parents, younger brother and a two-year-old toddler, welcomed the news.\n“I want to retrieve old photos and my mother’s belongings, our certificates and hopefully our limited-edition, out-of-print Gundam models and Legos, if they weren’t destroyed by the fire,” he said.\nFong, who lost his mother in the fire, hoped the government would repair one of Wang Cheong House’s three lifts to avoid climbing more than 20 storeys of stairs.\nHe also hoped that residents would be allowed multiple entries over several days to retrieve their belongings.\nAuthorities earlier unveiled a HK$6.8 billion (US$869.4 million) resettlement plan offering buy-backs at HK$8,000 or $10,500 per square foot or “flat-for-flat” exchanges at 10 designated subsidised projects.\nHowever, on-site redevelopment of Wang Fuk Court was ruled out due to an estimated time frame of nine to 10 years.\nHomeowners must indicate their choice by August 31, with those signing provisional agreements by June 30 given priority for September’s flat selection.\nMore than 630 homeowners of Wang Fuk Court on Wednesday signed an online petition to the chief executive, demanding a clear timeline to retrieve their belongings.\nThey argued they had the legal right to enter their properties before the August 31 government buyout deadline, while calling for dignified, phased access and ample time to clear their homes, viewing this as a vital step in healing and rebuilding their lives.\n",

Meta recently embedded Manus into its Ads Manager so that advertisers on the platform could get performance analytics and optimisation advice.\nNeither Meta nor Manus immediately responded to requests for comment on Thursday.\nThe integration has proceeded despite an ongoing investigation by the Chinese government.\nIn early January, just days after the deal was announced, the Ministry of Commerce said it would review and investigate the deal to assess whether it was consistent with China’s regulations on export controls, technology exports and external investments.\nThere has been no update since.\nThe South China Morning Post reported on the investigation a day before the official announcement, citing two sources.\nOne of them said Beijing feared the Manus case could set an uncomfortable precedent for other Chinese AI companies to follow by moving their operations abroad.\nThe start-up rose to fame in March 2025 after releasing what it described as the world’s first general AI agent – software that can complete tasks on a user’s behalf.\nThe team initially operated in Beijing and Wuhan, but moved to Singapore by mid-June, laying off some China-based staff and shutting down its Chinese social media accounts.\nChina updated its technology export controls in 2020 to cover certain algorithms, a change widely viewed as strengthening its legal tools to intervene in transactions after Washington pressured ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US operations.\nMeanwhile, Washington has also launched stringent rules restricting American capital from supporting Chinese AI and semiconductor firms.\n",

            "description": "A consortium comprising CK Infrastructure Holdings, CK Asset Holdings and Power Assets Holdings has agreed to sell all of its interest in UK Power Networks to French multinational electric utility Engie in a deal worth £10.5 billion (US$14.2 billion), according to a joint filing issued before the Hong Kong market opened on Thursday.\nThe agreement was signed after trading hours on Wednesday in Hong Kong, London and Paris.\nThe announcement triggered a rally across the CK group’s Hong Kong-listed entities. Both CK Infrastructure and its parent CK Hutchison closed up 4.5 per cent, while CK Asset gained 3 per cent and Power Assets rose 3.8 per cent on Thursday.\nThe disposal comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of CK group’s overseas infrastructure assets, particularly its port operations at the Panama Canal, which have become entangled in geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nUnder the agreement signed on Wednesday, indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries of the three Hong Kong-listed companies will sell their combined 100 per cent stake in the UK electricity distributor, along with shareholder loans extended to the business, to an entity fully owned by Engie.\nUK Power Networks is 40 per cent owned by CK Infrastructure, 40 per cent by Power Assets and 20 per cent by CK Asset. It is one of the United Kingdom’s largest power distributors, comprising three regional networks with a distribution area that covers 8.3 million consumers in London, southeastern and eastern England, with power lines spanning around 192,000km. The CK group acquired the UK electricity operator in 2010 for £5.77 billion.\nCK Hutchison Holdings founder Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong tycoon dubbed “Superman” for his business acumen, handed over the reins of his business empire to son Victor Li Tzar-kuoi in 2018.\nNow CK group chairman, Victor Li said in a news release that after the deal it would continue to “identify and pursue investment opportunities whether in regulated industries or businesses with long-term secure contracts, or other businesses which offer great potential, in existing and new markets, including the UK and beyond”.\nEngie, headquartered in Paris, is a major European energy company focused on electricity and gas networks, battery storage and local energy infrastructure, with operations in about 30 countries.\nFor Engie, the acquisition strengthens its footprint in the UK’s regulated electricity distribution market, where revenues are determined under a price-control regime that allows operators to recover inflation-linked costs over time.\nThe chief executive of Engie, Catherine MacGregor, said: “The acquisition of UK Power Networks marks a major milestone in the implementation of our strategic priorities.”\nCompletion of the deal is subject to several conditions, including independent shareholders’ approval at CK Asset and approvals at other related CK group entities, as well as regulatory clearance under the UK’s National Security and Investment Act.\nApproval is also required in relation to UK Power Networks’ insurance subsidiary in Guernsey. If regulatory conditions are not satisfied within 90 days, the deadline for completion of the deal could be extended by three months. Either the sellers or the purchaser may terminate the agreement if conditions remain unmet by the extended deadline.\nClosing is scheduled to take place on the 10th business day after the final condition has been fulfilled. The companies cautioned that completion is not guaranteed.\nThe Panama issue has intensified political attention on CK group in recent months. Last year, United States President Donald Trump accused China of “running the Panama Canal”, drawing global attention to the fact that ports at both entrances to the waterway have long been operated by a unit of CK Hutchison Holdings.\nLast year, CK Hutchison reached an in-principle agreement to sell an 80 per cent stake in the port assets to a Western consortium led by BlackRock and Terminal Investment Limited, but the deal faced resistance from Beijing and did not proceed.\nEarlier this week, Panama’s government seized the two ports after the country’s Supreme Court ruled the concession unconstitutional and voided a 2021 extension. CK Hutchison said it had ceased operations and launched arbitration, while Panama said port services would continue under temporary administration.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong authorities are open to supporting universities in issuing bonds to fund the development of the proposed University Town in the Northern Metropolis, with lawmakers calling for a dedicated approval and credit rating mechanism.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po told a meeting of the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee on Thursday the issuance of a “tertiary education bond” to support the University Town’s construction would be considered.\nThe University Town, which will include the city’s third medical school, was proposed as part of the 30,000-hectare (74,131-acre) Northern Metropolis megadevelopment close to the border with mainland China.\nAuthorities aim to increase the proposed area for the University Town from 90 hectares to 100 hectares, with the government also set to allocate three sites in Hung Shui Kiu and Ha Tsuen for tertiary institutions to develop campuses.\nAt the Legco committee meeting, lawmaker Andrew Fan Chun-wah called on the government to introduce more diverse funding options for the University Town, including issuing tertiary education bonds to expedite financing and diversify the city’s bond market.\nChan replied the government was receptive to various funding channels and harnessing market resources to support the University Town’s development.\n“We support universities in exploring various ways to raise funds to build a new campus. There are various approaches and formats,” he said, acknowledging Fan’s proposal as one of them.\n“We will leave room for each university to decide what suits them best. If they have proposals, we are happy to discuss with them and facilitate them.”\nThe annual budget announced on Wednesday also earmarked an additional HK$10 billion (US$1.27 billion) in loans to support campus construction in the University Town.\nEconomist Simon Lee Siu-po of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Shenzhen Finance Institute said universities had the capacity to issue bonds, citing their substantial financial reserves and profitable self-financing programmes, which would build market confidence.\nLee said universities could consider issuing bonds with three- to five-year tenors and at an interest rate of about 3 per cent, which he said would be attractive in the bond market.\n“Universities should avoid issuing bonds with longer maturities of five to 10 years,” the economist said. “The campus will be completed in three to five years. The bond tenor should align with their actual financing needs.”\nHe added that authorities could provide a guarantee for the bonds, allowing them to receive a credit rating equivalent to government bonds.\n\nLawmaker William Wong Kam-fai, an associate dean of the university’s engineering faculty, said the bond issuance would bypass lengthy funding applications to Legco or the University Grants Committee (UGC).\n“We had to apply for funding to Legco or the [UGC]. The process is time-consuming,” he said. “Issuing bonds allows quicker financing, without having to apply to the UGC, which is quite cumbersome.”\nWong noted that universities were non-profit-making institutions and that the interest rate would need careful calibration.\nBut lawmaker Lau Chi-pang, a professor and special adviser to Lingnan University’s president, cautioned about the attractiveness of university-issued bonds and their repayment capacity.\n“Universities are not profit-making institutions, unlike the government, which has vast financial resources or the profit-generating Airport Authority,” he said. “That kind of entity tends to attract investors when issuing bonds.”\nThe legislator said there were currently no guidelines for universities on issuing bonds and the move would require government approval. He urged authorities to set up a dedicated mechanism, including a credit rating process.\nOverseas universities often tap bond markets for financing, including Oxford University, which issued a 100-year bond in 2017 to raise £750 million (US$1.01 billion).\nThe University of California announced this week that it would sell about US$2 billion in general revenue bonds to finance its projects amid United States President Donald Trump’s crackdown on educational institutions.\nIn the Legco committee meeting, Chan also said that there was room to further raise the borrowing ceilings for the government’s green bonds and infrastructure bonds.\nIn his latest budget, the finance chief proposed raising the borrowing cap of the two programmes from HK$700 billion to HK$900 billion, describing it as a “balanced” approach that could fast-track the Northern Metropolis’ development.\n",

            "description": "JD.com is making a renewed push into its online supermarket business with a subsidy programme worth more than 20 billion yuan (US$2.9 billion) over three years, a move aimed at defending its position in China’s e-commerce and on-demand grocery sectors.\nIn a statement on Thursday, JD.com said the subsidy would cover products on a dedicated channel called “Billion-Yuan Supermarket”, under its JD Supermarket service. The aim was to help vendors generate an additional 200 billion yuan in sales over the next three years.\nThe move underscored a “strong defensive” strategy from JD.com directed at rivals such as Meituan, Pinduoduo and Alibaba Group Holding as they expand into each other’s territory, according to Li Chengdong, founder and chief analyst at e-commerce consultancy Dolphin Think Tank.\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nAfter Alibaba bolstered its efforts in the online food delivery market, JD.com expanded into the sector with a 10 billion yuan subsidy programme last year. Meanwhile, Meituan, which dominates the market, was making a bigger push into the country’s growing on-demand grocery market.\n\n“JD.com’s push into online food delivery costs them some losses, so they might as well subsidise their grocery business,” Li said.\nJD.com’s strategy over the past decade was to shift its focus from computers, communications and consumer electronics – products that got it started – to “fast-moving consumer goods” which require frequent replenishments, said Li.\nThe shift led the company to acquire on-demand delivery platform Dada Nexus as well as invest in bricks-and-mortar retail chains, including its own 7 Fresh, to double down on the on-demand sector. This was a booming arena in which Chinese “big tech” companies from Alibaba to Meituan were competing to secure a bigger slice of the pie, he added.\nJD.com said on Thursday that the scale of the subsidy would make the Billion-Yuan Supermarket its largest subsidised product category, surpassing electronics.\nJD Supermarket has experienced rapid growth, with the growth rate of users and orders exceeding 20 per cent in 2025, the company said, without revealing specific figures.\nThe company said last year that it aimed to boost the number of users of the service from 300 million to 500 million over the next three years.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong banks’ collateral asset valuations to continue declining in 2026: S&P",
            "description": "The value of collateral assets used by banks for commercial property loans is expected to continue declining in 2026, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings, as the sector has yet to find a clear bottom.\n“More collateral pain is likely this year for Hong Kong banks,” the credit rating agency said in a report published on Thursday, adding that a subset of small banks could face more acute strain.\nThat assessment comes as Hong Kong’s commercial property market remains on a sustained downturn that started in 2019, as rents continue to fall and vacancy rates soar.\nThe Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong’s sixth-largest bank by total assets, recently disclosed a HK$723 million (US$92.4 million) valuation loss in its total investment properties in 2025, rising sharply from HK$145 million in 2024.\nThat illustrated the ongoing pressure on collateral valuations, according to S&amp;P.\nThe ratings firm tested two stress scenarios: a 30 per cent discount to collateral and a worst-case scenario of a 50 per cent discount. The second scenario was based on recent sales of commercial properties in the secondary market, where owners sold them at around 50 per cent less than what they originally paid.\nBanks may be forced to dispose of collateral, especially non-prime assets, at steep discounts that exceed market average valuation, according to the report.\nSince the secondary market was not very transparent, it also remained difficult to track such risks in real time, it added.\nUnder a 50 per cent discount to collateral value, the return on average asset – a key gauge of profitability for banks – could fall to 0.58 per cent from 0.81 per cent in a base case. Their non-performing loan ratio could also grow to 4.3 per cent from 2.9 per cent.\n\nAlthough the slide in collateral asset valuations appeared to ease in recent months, the market could continue to weaken for a while, according to the S&amp;P report.\nSince late 2025, office and retail rents have fallen about 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. That was less severe than the situation in 2024, when office and retail leases were down 5 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.\nAccording to a report this week from Sam Gourlay, JLL’s head of office leasing advisory on Hong Kong Island, leasing demand in core areas such as Central was returning, primarily driven by financial institutions.\nStill, plenty of office space remained available, the report said, adding that retailers faced strong competition, including from cross-border options.\nPersistent oversupply and elevated vacancy rates were expected to continue exerting downward pressure on rental levels across Hong Kong’s grade A office market, according to property experts.\n“Based on our scenario analysis, the capitalisation of the Hong Kong banking system as a whole would remain resilient even under severe valuation shocks,” said S&amp;P credit analyst Phyllis Liu, adding that the impact was unlikely to materially weaken the sector’s capitalisation and trigger any systemic risk.\n“Many banks have cut exposure to commercial real estate in the past five years, thus limiting the impact of losses in this segment,” Liu said. “They also have solid earnings and excess capital to absorb potential losses.”\nSuch resilience, however, remains uneven. The report said large banks were best positioned to absorb stress.\nBut a subset of small banks with high exposure to non-prime commercial properties, weaker earnings buffers and aggressive risk appetite were vulnerable to risks such as stressed liquidity conditions or economic downturns, according to S&amp;P.\nSome small banks also have larger-than-average capital cushions, which would protect them against weaker earnings capacity, the report said. As a group, they would still be profitable under both stress scenarios, it added.\n",

            "description": "Semiconductor designer Hygon Information Technology and supercomputer maker Sugon, two stalwarts of China’s tech self-reliance efforts, reported surging revenue for 2025 amid strong domestic demand for home-grown computing systems.\nThe two Shanghai-listed companies’ latest financial results reflect a broader trend across China’s public and private sectors to increase engagement with domestic technology suppliers, as artificial intelligence development projects in the country intensified.\nHeadquartered in Beijing, Hygon posted revenue of 14.4 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) last year, a 56.9 per cent jump from 2024. Profit attributable to shareholders reached 2.54 billion yuan, up 32 per cent from a year earlier.\nHygon attributed the hefty sales growth to the “continued rise in demand for domestically produced high-end chips”. The company said its market share in high-end processors expanded amid cooperation with original equipment manufacturers and other partners in key industries and fields.\nThe firm expected even faster growth – between 62.9 per cent and 75.8 per cent – this first quarter, driven by increased investment in research and development due to “demand from the AI industry”.\n\nSugon, which makes high-performance computing systems and is the largest shareholder of Hygon, posted a 13.9 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue to 14.97 billion yuan last year. Its net profit rose 10.5 per cent to 2.11 billion yuan.\nThe strong performance of Hygon and Sugon also indicated the urgency in China to strengthen support for its domestic supply chain, as US tech restrictions and geopolitical tensions continue to affect the country’s technology sector.\nDespite major demand from Chinese AI companies, imports of Nvidia’s H200 graphics processing units into the country remain in limbo.\nChina, meanwhile, has continued to invest massive resources to build computing capacity amid a heated AI arms race with the US. In the five years to June 2025, the number of gigabit broadband users in the country grew 34-fold to 226 million, substantially lifting the country’s computing power demand.\nIn December, Hygon and Sugon called off plans for a mega-merger after months of talks, citing how “the market environment has changed significantly since the initial planning stages of this transaction”.\nThey said the factors affecting their respective stocks included “changes in the domestic and international environment, the overall trend of the mainland share market, changes in the artificial intelligence industry’s popularity and market expectations” .\nThe aborted merger dashed industry expectations that consolidating the assets of Sugon and Hygon would create a major domestic ecosystem covering advanced processors and high-performance servers.\n",

            "description": "Hong Kong’s decision to end tax breaks for private electric cars has sparked a rush to the showrooms, with some residents even selling their eligibility for the incentive scheme.\nA car dealer told the South China Morning Post on Thursday that sales had surged by a factor of 17, adding that one customer broke into tears just after midnight, fearing he had missed the registration deadline.\n“Last night there were many people … there was a queue at one point,” said Eric Wong Ngai-lik, chairman of Richburg Corporation, the Hong Kong dealer for electric vehicle (EV) brands MG and GAC Aion.\n“One customer arrived at our showroom after midnight and became very emotional, thinking he was no longer eligible. But the issue was resolved after we explained he would still qualify as long as he bought an in-stock vehicle before March 31.”\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced in his budget address on Wednesday that from April 1, the government will scrap first registration tax (FRT) concessions for private electric cars, including the “One-for-One Replacement Scheme”.\nThe scheme offers car owners a higher FRT concession of up to HK$172,500 (US$22,056) when they scrap and deregister an eligible older private car in exchange for a new electric car purchase.\nWong said sales had surged seventeenfold across his 12 stores on Wednesday, jumping from an average of 20 cars a day to about 340 by the evening.\nHe noted that many customers were confused about when the concessions would expire and feared that buying an EV after Wednesday night would make them ineligible.\n“Our staff only got off work at 3am,” he added.\nWong said the surge in customers was driven by “unclear information” released to the public about how the scheme would wind down.\n“To put it simply, the instructions are quite complicated and could be much clearer,” he said. “You shouldn’t put out a long block of text and expect the public to guess what it means.”\nUnder the government policy, buyers can still buy from available stock before March 31 to be eligible for the concession.\nBut orders for cars arriving later should have been placed on or before February 25, the day of the budget announcement, with applications submitted no later than February 24, 2027.\nSome car owners turned to social media after the budget announcement, offering to sell their eligibility for the tax breaks – either stand-alone or bundled with an older private car – for HK$25,000 to HK$60,000.\nOthers complained the prices for these “quotas,” as they are known locally, were unreasonably high.\n“[People] on Facebook are raising prices to HK$40,000 or HK$50,000,’ one user said.\nA Facebook group dedicated to the replacement scheme now has about 950 members.\nHowever, an industry leader warned that this option was not without risks and predicted a 40 per cent drop in sales in the months after the scheme ends on March 31.\nRingo Lee Yiu-pui, governor and honorary life president of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association, said it was risky to buy a car just for the purpose of getting the tax break.\nA car seller would need to help transfer ownership to the new EV buyer, Lee said, adding: “If problems arise, it could be troublesome, and you’ve already paid for the ‘quota’.”\nThe industry is predicting a 40 per cent drop in EV sales once the tax breaks end.\n“Maybe after four to five months, [we can] check the electric vehicle prices offered by car factories, whether there would be a huge price cut. Most of us aren’t very optimistic about this year,” Lee said, adding that any price drop would depend on whether car manufacturers were confident about Hong Kong’s market.\nThe FRT concession for electric commercial vehicles, electric motorcycles and electric motor tricycles will remain fully waived until the end of March 2028.\n",

            "description": "A proposed high-level committee that will focus on artificial intelligence (AI) could help tech start-ups in Hong Kong mitigate legal and geopolitical challenges, as well as gain access to important databases for model training, market leaders have said.\nBut the experts also told the South China Morning Post on Thursday that the committee, which was proposed in the latest budget and will be led by the city’s finance chief, would need to involve a diverse panel of experts and be “action-driven” to adapt quickly to the fast-shifting industry.\nLawmaker William Wong Kam-fai, who is also a professor of computational linguistics, said he expected the committee would “break down walls” and speed up funding approval processes, delivering faster support to the sector.\n“AI companies in Hong Kong will need much more computing power and better algorithms to handle big data effectively,” he said. “For example, more companies could be allowed to use supercomputing centres.”\nWong was referring to the Cyberport’s own supercomputing centre, which launched in December 2024.\n\n\n\n\nIn Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po’s budget speech on Wednesday, he pledged to establish and chair the “Committee on AI+ and Industry Development Strategy”, which would devise strategies and create favourable conditions for industrial transformation.\nThe committee will include academics and other experts, as well as representatives from enterprises and industry park companies.\nIt will initially focus on life and health technologies and “embodied AI”, a concept that involves AI embedded in physical systems such as robots or devices that can respond to their surroundings.\nSamuel Lam Hon-yuen, CEO of drone show operator X Social Group, said he believed such a committee could play a key role by channelling opinions among different stakeholders to create better conditions for product commercialisation.\nHe also called for greater diversity in industry committees.\n“In the past, some leading committees had been dominated by very academic people,” Lam said.\n“But the AI sector develops extremely fast and urgently needs input from practitioners across different industries – including industry, commerce, academia and research.”\n\nMichael So Chung-shing, founder of the Artificial Intelligence Application Research Society, or the AiX Society, emphasised that the industry was prone to fast changes and stressed the importance of speed for the committee.\nHe said the committee needed to do more than just “talk shop”, but added that finance chief Chan’s role as chairman could ensure the industry was more united, in addition to helping break down departmental barriers and efficiently mobilising resources.\n“The committee needs to include experts who are active on the front lines of the market and establish a rapid-response mechanism to translate the latest global technological trends, such as embodied AI, into policies that fit Hong Kong’s context,” So said.\n“We need to be able to quickly attract leading companies and provide them with application scenarios to seize the first-mover advantage.”\nLawmaker Wong highlighted significant regulatory obstacles in advancing life and health technology, as well as embodied AI.\n“The government could use the committee to coordinate regulatory sandboxes in the future,” he suggested, explaining that such initiatives would gather industry experiences across different application scenarios to help revise laws and address safety and legal concerns.\nWong said he believed the committee would also establish direct communication channels with mainland Chinese authorities, making it easier for Hong Kong companies to liaise directly with their counterparts across the border.\n",

            "title": "Fok welcomes ‘inspiring’ budget, says Asian Games will be part of funding review",
            "description": "Hong Kong lawmaker Kenneth Fok Kai‑kong welcomed the government’s HK$1.2 billion investment in sports development as “a timely boost that will inject fresh momentum”, while also urging a more strategic approach to building a sustainable sports industry.\nFok, who is also vice-president of the city’s Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&amp;OC), said details on how the money could be spent would be decided following “a comprehensive review of athlete support planned after the Asian Games”.\nSpeaking on Thursday, he called the new funding inspiring, but said any plans for the future should involve looking at “how to invest in ownership and long‑term capacities that strengthen Hong Kong’s position in the global sports ecosystem”.\nSports development in the city still relied heavily on “subsidy-based models”, Fok said in a written response to the budget, adding that there should be a focus on creating a self-sustaining industry.\n“It is time to consolidate the positive economic effects of professionalisation and industrialisation to strengthen the sector’s self-sustaining capacity,” he wrote.\n\nFok’s was responding to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo‑po’s budget announcement on Wednesday, when he outlined the cash boost for resources to boost athlete training programmes, improve coaching standards and attract more international competitions to the city.\nChan said the government would also continue to partner with Kai Tak Sports Park to “attract more major international sports events and activities proactively”.\nThe minister added that the government remained committed to expanding the “M” Mark system, which provides financial support for events such as the Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens and next week’s HSBC LIV Golf Hong Kong to strengthen the city’s position as an international sports event capital.\nFok said the budget’s focus on the “mega-event economy” came at a fitting time, with KTSP marking its first anniversary.\n“I welcome the government’s active efforts to bring more international sporting events to Hong Kong, marking an important step towards enhancing sports collaboration within the Greater Bay Area,” Fok said.\nHe also voiced support for the government’s measure to strengthen training for team-sport athletes. Fok noted that the 2024–27 Team Sports Development Pilot Scheme provided HK$30 million a year to eight associations, including football, basketball and handball, and benefited about 430 athletes.\n“However, many team-sport athletes have continued training and representing Hong Kong despite the lack of stable support, and their perseverance and dedication truly deserve recognition,” Fok said.\n“I hope to take the opportunity of this year’s Asian Games to conduct a comprehensive review of the long-term development of team sports, including athlete welfare, coaching support and resource allocation to help more team disciplines reach the elite level.”\nThe broader sports community also welcomed the increased funding, saying the new policies would strengthen both elite performance and the city’s event-driven sports economy.\nIn a statement, the SF&amp;OC also welcomed the initiative, with president Timothy Fok Tsun-ting praising the government’s “steadfast support for sports development.”\nStrengthening team training and coaching standards would help raise performance levels, while leveraging the “M Mark” system would “elevate Hong Kong’s international sporting status”, he said.\n“SF&amp;OC will continue to work hand in hand with the sports sector to make good use of resources, support the implementation of these measures, and help the Hong Kong sports community seize this opportunity to reach new heights,” Timothy Fok added.\nPui Kwan-kay, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, said the decision was “truly encouraging”, and believed it would directly benefit local football, particularly women’s and youth teams.\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong Sports Institute, which receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds every year, said it hoped the extra money would lead to more diverse sports events being held in the city.\nTang King-shing, the institute’s chairman, also believed it would help the city’s athletes “reach new heights on the international stage”.\nThe Hong Kong Golf Club, which hosts the LIV tournament every year, said the event underscored the city’s growing appeal as a venue for international sports showcases.\n",

            "description": "Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), Hong Kong’s largest developer by market capitalisation, reported a 36.2 per cent year-on-year jump in first-half net profit to HK$10.25 billion (US$1.3 billion).\nRevenue rose 32 per cent to HK$52.7 billion for the six months ended December from a year earlier, while operating income increased 10.7 per cent to HK$13.4 billion, the developer said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday. Underlying profit, which discounts property revaluations, gained 17 per cent to HK$12.2 billion.\nThe revenue, however, missed analysts’ estimates of HK$53.4 billion, while operating income beat forecasts of HK$12.82 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\nSHKP’s results are typically viewed as a bellwether of the city’s property market, given its extensive project pipeline and the scale of developments slated for completion in the coming years.\nChairman and managing director Raymond Kwok Ping-luen highlighted rising uncertainties brought about by geopolitical risks as well as the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics, noting that they were likely to lead the “global economy into uncharted waters”.\n\n“Despite increasing volatility in the market, anticipated further interest-rate cuts in the US, easing Sino-US tensions and accelerated investment in technology should support moderate global economic growth in 2026,” he said in the statement.\nKwok said the group planned to launch several new residential projects in Hong Kong over the next 10 months, including the second phase of Cullinan Harbour in Kai Tak, a project near the Tsuen Wan West MTR station, a project at Sha Po South in Yuen Long, the first phase of a large-scale development next to the Kwu Tung MTR station, a project near the City One MTR station in Sha Tin and the first phase of the Tung Shing Lei project in Yuen Long.\nSo far this year, the developer has sold out six rounds of sales totalling about 1,400 flats at its Sierra Sea project, the city’s largest residential development since 1999. Sierra Sea, located in Shap Sze Heung, between Sai Kung and Ma On Shan, consists of 9,700 units.\nSHKP’s major projects to be completed in Hong Kong from 2025 up to the end of its 2027-28 financial year would span 1.65 million sq ft to 4.37 million sq ft a year, it said in an earlier filing. Additionally, 10.3 million sq ft would be completed by the end of the 2028-29 financial year and beyond.\nInvestors have turned increasingly optimistic on Hong Kong’s property sector, singling out SHKP as a key beneficiary due to its 19.7 million sq ft of developable land, much of it tied to the government’s Northern Metropolis project, according to a note by Citi on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, annual earnings at Hysan Development, the largest commercial landlord in Causeway Bay, rose 28.3 per cent to HK$2.5 billion in 2025, driven mainly by the fair value gain from the disposal of flats in its upscale Bamboo Grove project in Mid-Levels, according to its filing on Thursday.\nIts recurring underlying profit, however, dropped 1.9 per cent to HK$1.91 billion, with chairman Irene Lee Yun-lien saying that “2025 was a pivotal year of progress and transformation for Hysan”.\nHysan’s turnover rose 1.6 per cent to HK$3.46 billion, with revenue from residential sales jumping 5 per cent, retail rising 2.6 per cent and office reporting flat growth.\nLast year, the company handed over 54 units in Bamboo Grove to buyers, with sales amounting to about HK$1.82 billion. With the units’ carrying value at HK$1.22 billion, Hysan said the disposal resulted in a fair value gain of HK$592 million.\nLooking ahead, Lee said 2026 would “present its own set of challenges”, but added that the group would be “battle-proven and ready”.\nHysan’s Lee Garden Eight project, a 1 million sq ft commercial development, will be ready in the third quarter of the year and will expand the company’s Lee Gardens leasable portfolio by about 30 per cent.\n",

            "description": "Semiconductor designer Hygon Information Technology and supercomputer maker Sugon, two stalwarts of China’s tech self-reliance efforts, reported surging revenue for 2025 amid strong domestic demand for home-grown computing systems.\nThe two Shanghai-listed companies’ latest financial results reflect a broader trend across China’s public and private sectors to increase engagement with domestic technology suppliers, as artificial intelligence development projects in the country intensified.\nHeadquartered in Beijing, Hygon posted revenue of 14.4 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) last year, a 56.9 per cent jump from 2024. Profit attributable to shareholders reached 2.54 billion yuan, up 32 per cent from a year earlier.\nHygon attributed the hefty sales growth to the “continued rise in demand for domestically produced high-end chips”. The company said its market share in high-end processors expanded amid cooperation with original equipment manufacturers and other partners in key industries and fields.\nThe firm expected even faster growth – between 62.9 per cent and 75.8 per cent – this first quarter, driven by increased investment in research and development due to “demand from the AI industry”.\n\nSugon, which makes high-performance computing systems and is the largest shareholder of Hygon, posted a 13.9 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue to 14.97 billion yuan last year. Its net profit rose 10.5 per cent to 2.11 billion yuan.\nThe strong performance of Hygon and Sugon also indicated the urgency in China to strengthen support for its domestic supply chain, as US tech restrictions and geopolitical tensions continue to affect the country’s technology sector.\nDespite major demand from Chinese AI companies, imports of Nvidia’s H200 graphics processing units into the country remain in limbo.\nChina, meanwhile, has continued to invest massive resources to build computing capacity amid a heated AI arms race with the US. In the five years to June 2025, the number of gigabit broadband users in the country grew 34-fold to 226 million, substantially lifting the country’s computing power demand.\nIn December, Hygon and Sugon called off plans for a mega-merger after months of talks, citing how “the market environment has changed significantly since the initial planning stages of this transaction”.\nThey said the factors affecting their respective stocks included “changes in the domestic and international environment, the overall trend of the mainland share market, changes in the artificial intelligence industry’s popularity and market expectations” .\nThe aborted merger dashed industry expectations that consolidating the assets of Sugon and Hygon would create a major domestic ecosystem covering advanced processors and high-performance servers.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong stocks retreat as Nvidia earnings fail to sustain AI momentum",
            "description": "A rebound in Hong Kong stocks hit a snag, with the benchmark closing lower as results from US chip giant Nvidia failed to rekindle confidence in the artificial intelligence trade.\nThe Hang Seng Index dropped 1.4 per cent to 26,381.02 at the close on Thursday. The Hang Seng Tech Index slumped 2.9 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index slid 0.2 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index was little changed.\nAlibaba Group Holding declined 3.2 per cent to HK$143.60 and Tencent Holdings fell 2 per cent to HK$512. Meituan lost 2.7 per cent to HK$80.45 and JD.com retreated 2.6 per cent to HK$104.\nBucking the downtrend, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing rose 0.8 per cent to HK$415.40 after posting a 38 per cent profit increase last year. CK Infrastructure Holdings added 4.5 per cent to HK$67, Power Assets Holdings rallied 3.8 per cent to HK$63.60 and CK Asset Holdings gained 3 per cent to HK$48.06 after agreeing to sell all of its interest in a UK power distributor for £10.5 billion (US$14.2 billion).\nRevenue for Nvidia, at the centre of the global AI frenzy, beat the consensus estimate but fell short of the most bullish projections of more than US$80 billion, sending its shares lower in after-hours trading. The US chipmaker reported a 73 per cent jump in quarterly revenue to US$68.1 billion for the three months ended January. That compared with the consensus estimate of US$65.8 billion.\n“The market is no longer pricing growth. It is pricing perpetuity,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. “When a company becomes the physical backbone of an industrial revolution, expectations detach from gravity. Investors are not asking whether revenue is growing. They are asking whether this growth can compound at escape velocity indefinitely.”\nThe muted reaction to Nvidia’s resilient earnings underscored a cooling of the AI mania globally and a rapid shift in the narrative that had driven up valuations of tech stocks. As the AI scare trade unfolds, investors have fretted over the impact on established industries and questioned the durability of massive investments in data centres.\nOther major Asian markets all closed higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.3 per cent, while South Korea’s Kospi surged 3.7 per cent and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.5 per cent.\n",

            "title": "Nvidia reports record earnings quarter as China’s H200 sales freeze persists",
            "description": "Nvidia has yet to generate any revenue from its H200 chips in China and does not know if any sales will be allowed in the country, the company said, as the US chip giant reported record quarterly revenue on surging demand for data centre processors.\nWhile the Santa Clara-based tech giant remains the primary beneficiary of the global generative artificial intelligence boom, its ability to navigate the US-China tech war has become a challenge, with the pipeline for the H200 – Nvidia’s second-most powerful graphics processing unit to date – still dry in China.\nNo revenue had been booked from H200 chips and imports by China remained uncertain, despite small amounts being cleared by Washington for China-based customers, said Colette Kress, Nvidia’s executive vice-president and chief financial officer, during a post-earnings call on Thursday.\nThe remarks echoed those of US Commerce Department official David Peters, who said on Tuesday that Nvidia had yet to sell any H200 units in China.\nThe comments underscore regulatory uncertainty from Beijing regarding the imports of the GPU, which remains a key option for Chinese tech giants to train their AI models, after it was cleared by Washington in January on condition that the shipments do not exceed 50 per cent of the volume sold in the US.\nKress also flagged rising competition in China, where domestic chipmakers have rushed to initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent months to meet soaring demand and position themselves as alternatives to Nvidia.\n\n“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term,” said Kress, who added that the US must “engage every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China” to maintain its leadership in AI computing.\nNvidia’s revenue in China fell to US$19.7 billion for the financial year ended January 25, down from US$25 billion a year earlier, according to its latest earnings release.\nJensen Huang, president and CEO of Nvidia, struck an upbeat tone, highlighting the company’s deeper partnerships this quarter with leading frontier model makers including OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and xAI, which will use Nvidia’s Blackwell and coming Rubin processors for training and inference.\nThe optimism was reflected in the company’s quarterly earnings. It reported a revenue of US$68.1 billion for the quarter ended on January 25, up 73 per cent from a year earlier, beating the consensus estimate of US$65.8 billion. That was largely attributed to growth in its data centre revenue, which surged 75 per cent year on year to a record US$62.3 billion.\nFor the current financial quarter, it expected revenue to be around US$78 billion, compared with US$26 billion from the same period last year, also above forecasts.\nHuang said the company was able to move quickly because global demand for tokens had “gone completely exponential” as the industry went through an inflection point.\n“We know that the amount of computation necessary for the modern way of doing software is growing exponentially, and our strategy is to deliver an entire AI infrastructure every single year,” he said.\nThe earnings came amid concerns about AI’s economic impact, after a report by US research outfit Citrini forecast mass unemployment and recession by 2028 due to agentic AI models. The warning triggered a sell-off on Wall Street, as investors feared traditional business models could be cannibalised.\n“At a system level, we expect Nvidia to continue to be the leader across both training and reasoning-focused inference workloads,” Citi Research analysts said in a recent note. As rising capital expenditure levels among US hyperscalers raised concerns over an AI bubble, these investments would reaccelerate industry revenue and earnings growth, they added.\nNvidia shares initially jumped nearly 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the earnings beat before paring gains to trade flat.\n",

            "title": "Hong Kong fugitive’s father jailed for trying to cash out her insurance policy",
            "description": "A Hong Kong court has sentenced the father of a wanted activist to eight months in jail for attempting to cash out an insurance policy worth more than HK$88,000 (US$11,251) in his daughter’s name, rejecting suggestions that the sentence amounted to “collective punishment” against a relative of a fugitive.\nKwok Yin-sang, 69, became the first person jailed for trying to deal with the financial assets of an absconder – his 29-year-old daughter, Anna Kwok Fung-yee, a United States-based activist who had a HK$1 million bounty placed on her head in 2023, for allegedly violating the Beijing-decreed national security law.\nAnna Kwok, the executive director of the US-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, is wanted by national security police for allegedly colluding with foreign forces by instigating sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland China.\nThe elder Kwok, who runs a local engineering firm, was convicted of violating the city’s domestic national security law between January and February last year after twice attempting to cash out a life and personal accident insurance policy with AIA International. He had bought the policy for his daughter when she was 22 months old.\nThe defence argued that Kwok had paid all the premiums and believed the policy formed part of his own assets, giving him control over the funds.\nDefence counsel Steven Kwan Man-wai told Andy Cheng Lim-chi, acting principal magistrate of West Kowloon Court, that the father should not be punished for his daughter’s fugitive status, saying otherwise it would amount to “collective punishment”.\nKwan contended that the ordinance was intended to target crimes endangering national security, not to exert pressure on individuals.\nCheng explained that in his reasons for sentence, the legislative intent of the relevant provision was to prevent anyone from dealing with an absconder’s assets, thereby “reaching the intended effect of punishing the absconders”.\n“This case targeted the absconders’ assets and whether the defendant’s act would enable the fugitive to remain at large,” he said. “Collective punishment does not exist. Whether the defendant is the relative of the absconder is also irrelevant.”\nAlthough the magistrate accepted that Kwok’s actions did not directly endanger national security, he ruled that the attempt to access his daughter’s assets could have made her less likely to return to Hong Kong because someone else could have handled it for her.\n\nCheng had earlier found that the activist was the policy’s sole beneficiary, while her father merely held the proceeds in trust and had no authority to transfer or withdraw funds without her consent.\nKwok met his daughter in Japan in early 2025 to obtain her signature on an application form, which he later discovered was out of date and no longer valid.\nInsurance agent Cheng Wai-yee, who had handled policies taken out by Kwok for his three children, suggested that he sign next to his daughter’s name after he said she would be unable to sign a new form soon.\nAIA’s records indicated that Kwok remained the policy owner even after his daughter reached adulthood. The agent could not explain why the record had not been updated.\nProsecutors alleged that Kwok had twice attempted to deal with the insurance policy, while the defence argued he was merely processing a change of ownership application.\nDuring mitigation, the defence sought a short custodial sentence or a community service order. Magistrate Cheng rejected the request, noting that Kwok had shown no remorse, having been convicted after trial.\nCiting classical sentencing principles, Cheng said any offence endangering national security must serve the purposes of deterrence, retribution, denunciation and incapacitation.\nConsidering the seriousness of the case, the magistrate set a starting point of nine months’ imprisonment before reducing it by one month to reflect Kwok’s clear record and age.\n",

            "title": "Long-term gains worthwhile, Paul Chan says amid budget sweetener complaints",
            "description": "Hong Kong’s financial chief has defended his latest budget against public criticism over the lack of sweeteners, stressing that the government must balance its finances with long-term investments for the city’s benefit.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said on Thursday he would brief credit-rating agencies and the International Monetary Fund next month on his budget, including the proposed HK$150 billion (US$19.2 billion) transfer from the Exchange Fund to support infrastructure projects.\nHis remarks at a radio forum followed Wednesday’s budget announcement to transfer investment income from the fund, which has raised concerns about the city’s financial stability.\nDuring the forum, callers complained that the budget offered too little support for the general public.\n“I am disappointed that giving out money or consumption vouchers has fallen off the radar. You hold a consultation every year, but you never listen … the budget consultation is meaningless,” a resident surnamed Tang said.\nChan explained that the government had used different approaches to put more money back into people’s pockets, including increasing tax allowances, offering tax reductions and organising more events to lure tourists.\n“It can boost businesses, creating more job opportunities and higher incomes for residents. We remain committed to that, as it also brings long-term benefits,” he said.\nHe added that the tax relief measures could help a family with two children save about HK$10,000 a year.\nThe middle class also raised concerns. Another resident surnamed Chan, who has a child and a combined monthly income of around HK$70,000 with his wife, said he hoped the government would offer more support to families not eligible for many welfare benefits.\n“We cannot buy subsidised housing as we have passed the asset limit, so we buy a private flat. After deducting all the expenses, we can only save about HK$10,000 to HK$20,000 per month,” he said.\nSecretary Chan responded that the government had proposed a significant increase in the basic and child tax allowances and would support residents as much as possible within its capacity.\n“At the end of the day, we’re still in the stage of economic recovery. We’ll need to issue bonds in the future, so we have to strike a balance,” he said.\nChan added that the government’s relief measures reached HK$22 billion and that it needed to remain financially cautious.\n\nAnother resident, surnamed Tsang, asked why the government chose to invest in the Northern Metropolis megaproject that would benefit the other side of the border instead of supporting the general public.\nChan stressed that it was “worthwhile” to invest in the project, which aims to transform 30,000 hectares of land near the city’s border with the mainland into an economic powerhouse and housing hub.\n“Previously, when we invested in research and development and universities for technology and innovation development, all the commercialised production went to mainland China. Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area pocketed all the economic benefits,” Chan said.\n“Now, the Northern Metropolis is the future innovation and technology hub. We will attract enterprises to Hong Kong. The tax return is ours, employment is ours, commercialisation is ours.”\nAsked whether bond issuance was no longer sufficient to cover infrastructure expenses, prompting the government to seek a transfer from the Exchange Fund, Chan said he was considering both options to support the metropolis’ development.\n“We have many money pockets … Last year, the Exchange Fund investment return was very good, with over HK$330 billion. Whether the money is in the Exchange Fund or used for infrastructure in the Northern Metropolis, both are investments,” he said.\n",
