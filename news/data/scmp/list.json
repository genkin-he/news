            "description": "Hong Kong could issue Islamic bonds to fund the Northern Metropolis megaproject as long as they are a cost-effective option, given the city’s established legal and regulatory framework for such activities under the faith, the finance chief has said.\\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po made the remarks on Thursday as he wrapped up his trip to this year’s Future Investment Initiative forum in Riyadh, where his trade delegation also yielded five memorandums of understanding (MOUs).\\n“The legal and regulatory framework for issuing Islamic bonds is mature. We can proceed at any time [for the Northern Metropolis], provided the market reflects that issuing these instruments is cheaper and yields better results,” he said in an interview with the Post in Riyadh.\\nChan said that the government would review funding options for the scheme, which aims to turn 30,000 hectares (74,132 acres) of land into an engine for economic growth and a housing hub, and would select the most cost-effective method while expediting development.\\nIn the annual budget announced in February last year, Chan said authorities planned to issue HK$95 billion (US$12.2 billion) to HK$135 billion in bonds annually over the next five years to drive the development of the Northern Metropolis and other infrastructure projects.\\nChan stressed on Thursday that Islamic finance was “always a component” of the government’s financial planning.\\nHe also said that, building on the momentum established at last year’s conference, five MOUs had been signed during the trip, with most involving technology firms and Hong Kong’s Trade Development Council (TDC).\\n\\nMaphive Technology CEO John Chan, who is part of the delegation team, expressed positivity about the trip, which culminated in the successful signing of an MOU with a subsidiary of Olayan Saudi Holding Company, part of the hospitality and events sector.\\n“I was able to meet investors during the trip and build up solid connections with some of them,” he said, adding that this was his third visit to Riyadh.\\nThe TDC signed an MOU with the Digital Cooperation Organisation, a multilateral body that focuses on the digital economy. The deal aims to foster collaboration in e-commerce, innovation and inclusive economic growth.\\nThe cooperation would support the participation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in TDC trade fairs and business-matching events, the Hong Kong body said.\\nPaul Chan also said Saudi companies showed great interest in utilising Hong Kong as a platform to access the wider Asian market during the meeting with enterprises from the country.\\n“Hong Kong could act as a two-way platform for both Saudi firms and Hong Kong and mainland companies [to interchange and collaborate],” he said.\\nHe further stated that authorities were actively building an ecosystem to suit both parties, pointing to Hong Kong’s launch of Asia’s first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking Saudi Arabia’s Islamic government bonds earlier this year.\\nFollowing the ETF launch, market anticipation is high for the first firm from the Middle East to list in Hong Kong.\\nChan noted that the first company could be listed in a few months, citing Dubai-based diaper maker Softcare, which began assessing investor interest in its Hong Kong initial public offering after passing its listing hearing in late October.\\n“I expect that gradually we will see companies from Saudi Arabia come to Hong Kong to list, as the kingdom has a vast number of projects that require capital,” he said.\\nUnder the kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan, Saudi Arabia is aggressively modernising and diversifying its economy to reduce its reliance on oil.\\nSpeaking of forming close ties between Hong Kong and Gulf states, Chan said the authorities were actively progressing with plans to establish an Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Riyadh, with “significant progress expected in the next few months”.\\nThe government currently operates one ETO in the Middle East, located in Dubai.\\n",

            "title": "Indonesia still ‘considering’ buying Chinese J-10 fighter jets to modernise its military",
            "description": "Indonesia is still “considering” acquiring Chinese J-10 fighter jets, but no decision has been made yet, according to Jakarta’s Ministry of Defence, clarifying earlier reports that the country was set to buy up to 42 units to modernise its military.\\n“It’s still being analysed and reviewed. At the moment, we are considering all platforms that can fulfil our need to help guard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” ministry spokesman Brigadier General Frega Wenas Inkiriwang said.\\nOn October 16, local and newswire agencies quoted Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin as saying the J-10 “will be flying in Jakarta shortly” but gave no details.\\nThe following week, Sjamsoeddin said Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, would be the one to decide whether to buy the J-10s, according to local news outlet Tempo. Prabowo has not made a decision.\\nObservers say the J-10s would be cheaper than other fighters on the market but adding them to the Indonesian Air Force would complicate operations within its own military and with the armed forces of other countries.\\n\\nFirst developed by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation in the 1980s as China’s third-generation fighter jet, the J-10 series has in recent years been upgraded to the 4.5-generation J-10C and become one of Beijing’s major defence industry products.\\nDubbed the “Vigorous Dragon”, the fourth-generation fighter is equipped with active electronically scanned array radar and advanced air-to-air missiles like the PL-15.\\nIf Indonesia did go ahead and buy the aircraft, it would be China’s first sale of military hardware to the Southeast Asian giant.\\nIndonesia has 110 fighter planes in total, including American F-16s, Russian Su-27s and Su-30s, plus British BAE Hawk 100 and 200 series aircraft. Indonesia also ordered 42 French Rafales for US$8.1 billion in 2022, with the first six due for delivery next year.\\nIn addition, Jakarta has signed a contract to buy 48 Kaan fighter jets from Turkey and is scheduled to receive two new T-50i fighter jets from South Korea in November as part of a procurement deal for six T-50i Golden Eagle jets.\\nBut, for now, it has just 62 operational fighters in its ranks. Spare parts for Russian-made Sukhoi Su-27s and Su-30s have become scarce and US-made F-16s are showing their age, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a Canberra-based think tank.\\nASPI said the J-10 piqued Indonesian officials’ interest after Pakistan’s J-10s reportedly outperformed India’s French-made Rafale fighter jets during a clash in May.\\nHowever, Muhammad Fauzan Malufti, an Indonesian defence analyst, said Indonesian officials had not cited the India-Pakistan air skirmish as a factor. “Even if it played a role, I don’t think it is the main factor behind the decision,” Malufti said.\\nMalufti said the possible J-10 procurement served as a “political signal of neutrality and non-alignment” from Indonesia.\\n\\n\\nIan Storey, a senior fellow at the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said price was a major consideration for the Indonesian military.\\n“Cost is one important factor, as the J-10 is less than half the price of its Western analogues, America’s F-16 and France’s Rafale,” Storey said, adding that Indonesia “does not want to depend” on any single country for its military equipment.\\nDuring the 1990s, the administration of then US president Bill Clinton imposed sanctions on Indonesia’s armed forces, citing human rights abuses in East Timor. As a result, the Indonesian Air Force’s American-made planes were grounded for lack of spare parts.\\nIn addition, the Prabowo administration has sought to “pursue a balanced foreign policy between East and West”, Storey said.\\nBuying the Chinese jets would reflect that policy and increase the number of countries from whom Indonesia sourced aircraft, but it would also complicate interoperability within its existing fleet and during military exercises with other countries.\\nStorey said it would be “a very challenging task for the Indonesian Air Force to integrate the encrypted communication, sensor networks and datalinks of Western, Russian and Chinese aircraft”.\\n“The air force will have to maintain separate and costly training, maintenance and logistical streams for all these different warplanes,” he added.\\nStorey also said the J-10’s electronic, sensor and communication systems were incompatible with Western-made aircraft. He said Indonesia would try to integrate the different systems but achieving full interoperability would be technically complex and very expensive.\\n“At best, Indonesia may only achieve partial interoperability, and that will be suboptimal in combat situations,” Storey said.\\n\\nMalufti agreed, saying the various aircraft from different countries would mean different spare parts, software, manuals, weapons, training and supply chains.\\n“[This would] force the Indonesian Air Force to buy unique tools, weapons and spare parts as well as create different training programmes for each aircraft, resulting in higher maintenance and training costs,” he said.\\nThe addition of Chinese fighter jets to Indonesia’s fleet would carry implications for its joint military exercises with Western countries.\\nStorey said the US “won’t allow its own fighter jets to exercise with Indonesia’s Russian-made and Chinese-made aircraft”.\\nThis prospect could complicate Indonesia’s flagship joint military exercise, Super Garuda Shield, held annually since 2007 in collaboration with the US and 11 other countries including Singapore, Germany, Australia, France and Britain.\\nThis year’s exercise involved more than 6,000 troops and was designed to boost interoperability and strengthen collective readiness among the participating armed forces.\\nFor China, a J-10 sale would mark a breakthrough in its defence diplomacy in Southeast Asia. Indonesia would become the first Association of Southeast Asian Nations member state to acquire a wholly Chinese-made modern, multirole fighter jet, according to Storey. At present, Myanmar operates JF-17s – fighter jets jointly developed by China and Pakistan – and the Chinese FTC-2000, a light training jet.\\nBut even if Indonesia did invest in the Chinese military hardware, “very few other regional states are likely to follow suit”, Storey said.\\nHe said Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia would be holdouts “because they are rival claimants with China in the South China Sea”. Singapore would “stick with US-made fighters” and Thailand was “unlikely to buy Chinese fighter jets either, preferring Western aircraft”.\\n“Myanmar might, if China is prepared to extend a generous loan,” Storey said.\\nIf it went ahead, it would “mark a significant milestone in Jakarta-Beijing defence cooperation”, Malufti said. “China would definitely use the deal to showcase the J-10 as a credible alternative to Western fighters.”\\n",

            "description": "Developer China Vanke reported a deeper third-quarter loss, highlighting mounting challenges as the prolonged property market downturn continues to weigh on its sales.\\nThe Shenzhen-based company posted a loss of 16.1 billion yuan (US$2.3 billion) in the three months ended September 30, roughly doubling its loss from a year earlier. That brings its combined losses for the first nine months of the year to 28 billion yuan, according to a statement to the Shenzhen exchange on Thursday.\\nPersistent weakness in China’s housing market is creating pressure on the developer’s bottom line, despite increased financial support from its largest state-owned shareholder, Shenzhen Metro Group. The company’s financial position remains vulnerable as it deals with a wall of onshore debt maturities.\\nThe country’s home sales deteriorated further in July, and new-home prices fell at an accelerated pace. The price slump is deterring homebuyers who are increasingly concerned about the viability of buying real estate as a store of wealth.\\nThe developer’s gross contracted sales will likely further decline over the next six to 12 months, Moody’s Ratings said in a note earlier this month.\\nVanke was once China’s largest developer but has become the latest flashpoint in the nation’s prolonged property crisis, underscoring the severity of the sector’s challenges.\\nThe country’s new home sales by area may decline about 15 per cent from their current level before the sector stabilises, Fitch Ratings analyst Lulu Shi said earlier this week.\\nThe builder still has 10.8 billion yuan of onshore debt maturing by the end of this year. Its biggest maturity wall will be next year, when about 24 billion yuan of onshore public bonds and loans come due.\\n\\n“Vanke could face a more than 100 billion yuan drop in sales proceeds, which would worsen its funding gap and raise the costs of a government rescue,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kristy Hung said in a note last week.\\nSeparately, Vanke said earlier in October that recently appointed Chairman Xin Jie resigned and that Huang Liping, general manager of Shenzhen Metro, would take over the role. Huang has served as a board member at Vanke since 2021.\\nInvestors grew concerned about future state support after the sudden resignation, leading to a mild decline in one of its dollar notes.\\nStill, Vanke said in the earnings release that Shenzhen Metro intended to provide another loan not exceeding 2.2 billion yuan. The funds are earmarked to help Vanke repay principal and interest on publicly issued bonds, the same purpose as the loans the shareholder provided earlier this year.\\nThe developer has secured sufficient funds to redeem a 2.5 billion yuan bond ahead of its maturity, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, a move that may help soothe market worries.\\n",

            "title": "How Hong Kong can capitalise on Trump’s attacks on US universities",
            "description": "Few moments in US history have tested academic freedom as much as the present, with US President Donald Trump’s administration releasing a 10-point Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. What started as bureaucratic proposals have hardened into a national doctrine tying federal funding to political conformity. It is changing the nature of US universities and reshaping international education options.\\nThe plan, initially sent to nine universities, proposed conformity with certain demands in return for securing preferential access to federal funds. They include removing race and gender factors from admissions and hiring, publishing detailed student applicant data, reinstating standardised testing, freezing tuition fees for five years and limiting the international undergraduate enrolment to 15 per cent.\\nUniversities with endowments exceeding US$2 million per student must offer free tuition for science degrees. Diversity and inclusion programmes are to be replaced by a “marketplace of ideas”. Institutions that sign the compact gain better access to federal research funding; those that refuse risk investigation or frozen grants.\\nThe backlash has been considerable. Most universities approached, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brown, have rejected the agreement, viewing it as an attack on academic independence.\\nPublic opinion reflects these concerns. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed most Americans view the plan as government overreach. While some support measures to reduce costs in higher education, many feel uncomfortable with Washington’s growing control over campus affairs. This discomfort has sparked widespread opposition and protests across the country. Although higher education needs reform, many believe political enforcement is the wrong method.\\nFor international students, the plan comes amid a wave of restrictions. The Department of Homeland Security wants to replace the flexible “duration of status” visa rule with fixed terms of no more than four years, requiring renewals for longer courses. Applicants now face extended background and social media checks, new fees and mandatory reporting by universities. Visa caps targeting certain nationalities, especially Chinese students in science and technology fields, have fuelled uncertainty.\\n\\n\\nThis uncertainty is especially evident in India, where generations of students have aspired to study in the United States. That ambition is being disrupted, with a reported 45 per cent decline in Indian student arrivals. Academic pathways that once represented opportunity are now fraught with bureaucratic barriers, undermining the essence of US higher education and its ability to attract global talent, reducing its influence on the world stage.\\nMeanwhile other places are relaxing their admission policies. Hong Kong raised the limit on non-local undergraduates in publicly funded programmes to 40 per cent in 2024, and this year’s policy address proposes raising it to 50 per cent next year, signalling the city’s ambition. Universities are working to expand scholarships, research collaborations and partnerships. They offer a blend of East-West access and academic independence that appeals to students and academics seeking opportunity and openness.\\nBut challenges remain. While Hong Kong’s policies are evolving to attract international students, their integration into local communities and university life still lags behind. Many mainland and non-local students struggle to form meaningful connections with local peers.\\nUniversities need to go beyond academic achievement and foster the soft skills that enrich students’ experiences and prepare them to succeed in a multicultural world. These skills are vital not only for academic or professional success but also to promote cultural exchange and build genuine connections.\\nBuilding these connections is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, respect and a sense of community. As a student in the US, I formed lifelong friendships with peers from around the world, gained deep cultural insights and learned to navigate differences – experiences that enriched my education.\\n\\nFor Hong Kong to become a global education hub, it must cultivate integration, welcoming students from all parts of the world and creating connections that inspire collaboration and innovation.\\nThis is not new for Hong Kong. In the 1960s and 1970s, many Southeast Asian youth of Chinese descent came here for education because their parents wanted them to learn Chinese and options at home were limited. When these students returned home, they became valuable business connections, carrying fond memories of Hong Kong’s people, food and culture. Trust, built through shared experience, laid the groundwork for future business.\\nThis highlights the importance of Hong Kong leveraging its role as an international education hub to cultivate lasting connections. International students, including from the mainland, should leave with more than an education; they should carry meaningful relationships with local and international peers.

            "title": "Singapore’s Megan Khung tragedy: is it just about system lapses?",
            "description": "When John’s* parents divorced four years ago, his father turned violent.\\n“He became an alcoholic, there was a lot of verbal and emotional abuse, and he would lock me out of the house,” said John, now in his 20s, who still lives with his father. “Last April, he broke into my room and beat me with a screwdriver. He tried to hurt me, and he did.”\\nJohn reported the case to the police, who asked if he had another place to stay the night. Earlier this year, he applied for a personal protection order against his father, and the abuse has since waned.\\nJohn recalled that at the height of the violence, he had trouble understanding “why I was the one who was supposed to help myself escape the situation”.\\nSingapore’s child-protection system has been thrust into the spotlight following the horrific case of four-year-old Megan Khung, who was abused and beaten to death by her mother, Foo Li Ping, and the woman’s then boyfriend, Wong Shi Xiang.\\nMegan had suffered a year of abuse – including being forced to sleep in a planter box and getting hit by a water hosepipe – before she died in February 2020 after Wong dealt a fatal punch to her stomach. Wong and Foo burned Megan’s body in a metal barrel, and her death was only discovered five months later, following police reports lodged by her biological father and maternal grandmother.\\nIn April, Wong was sentenced to 30 years’ jail and 17 strokes of the cane, while Foo was sentenced to 19 years in jail.\\n\\nThe government set up an independent review panel to look into the case, and the report, released earlier this month, identified multiple lapses by several agencies. Breaches included the mischaracterisation of Megan’s injuries by social workers, as well as the failure of police officers and child protection specialists to follow up on the case.\\nAfter the findings, a police investigative officer resigned, and her supervisor was fined. In a rare move, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli apologised and said the agencies could have done more.\\nIn a social media post to announce that the agencies had fully accepted the review panel’s findings on October 23, Masagos said: “We will reflect on the findings and take concrete steps to improve our support for vulnerable children ... Our resolve is absolute: We will do everything possible to prevent such tragedies from happening again.”\\nJohn, who said Megan’s death broke his heart when he read about it, told This Week in Asia: “I’m glad that I got to stand up for myself, but for a child like Megan, she’s not capable of doing what I did.\\n“I think those in the system need to have a bit more initiative and maybe more experience and speak out for those who don’t have a voice.”\\n\\nDid norms play a part?\\nMegan’s case has sparked reflection on whether cultural norms contributed to the tragedy, even as systemic lapses were spotlighted in the review report.\\nProfessionals told This Week in Asia that societal acceptance of physical discipline and the inclination to give in to authority might have contributed to the lapses.\\n“In many Asian societies, physical discipline is still perceived as an expression of parental care or authority,” said Lee Jungup, associate professor of social work at the National University of Singapore (NUS). “This can make early signs of abuse less visible to both families and professionals.”\\nThe cultural perception might also lead to a misclassification of abuse as discipline, said Mu Zheng, assistant professor at the sociology and anthropology department at NUS.\\nIn a report submitted to a regulatory authority in April 2019, Beyond Social Services, the social work agency that ran Megan’s preschool, characterised her bruises as a result of “physical punishment [that] was excessive”. The regulatory authority did not follow up with the case after the school principal confirmed that Megan was well and attending school regularly.\\nDaniel Lopez, an executive committee member at NGO Society Against Family Violence, said the relevant social worker’s description of the abuse as punishment might have affected authorities’ follow-up action. “Framing it as a punishment might have lessened the threat, because it seems interlinked with family values.”\\nIn September 2019, Beyond Social Services called the Child Protection Service, a government division that investigates child abuse cases, on two occasions and brought up Foo and Wong’s suspected drug use, as well as Megan’s unknown whereabouts.\\n\\nChild Protection Service recorded only one call, where it advised that Megan’s grandmother make a police report over the missing child.\\n“I think Beyond Social Services did the best they could,” Lopez said. “They highlighted that she couldn’t be sighted – this means they did try to locate her, which is the most that a community agency can do.”\\nLopez noted that not all stakeholders in the child protection system had equal authority.\\nA younger worker who challenges the decision of higher-ups may be perceived as disrespectful, according to Lopez, who has experience in social work. “There is a bit of a culture of fear or apprehension in questioning the judgment of people above us.”\\nTo name and shame?\\nIn the wake of Megan’s case, more child abuse cases have been reported in recent months.\\nTeo Guan Huat, 61, who worked as a preschool cook, pleaded guilty in court to sexually assaulting three girls, aged one to two, earlier this month. He said he molested the children as they were too young to speak, and there would be a smaller chance of him being caught, according to local media. The gag order on Teo’s identity was lifted after the prosecutor clarified in court that keeping the names of the children and school undisclosed was sufficient to protect the identity of the victims.\\nIn a related case, four women, who worked at the same preschool, were charged in February with covering up Teo’s sexual assault on the premises. They had allegedly deleted footage of Teo molesting a toddler in 2023. The women in this pending case have not been identified.\\nThe lack of identification of responsible parties has sparked debate on whether naming offenders would serve the public interest and boost deterrence.\\n\\nEven in the absence of a gag order, Singapore’s law prohibits the publication of information relating to court proceedings that could lead to the identification of any child or young person, such as the name, address and school of a victim.\\nLawyer Amarjit Singh told This Week in Asia that one downside of anonymity meant that culprits were spared from public accountability, and this could discourage other victims from coming forward.\\nBut the fear of being identified might also discourage victims from testifying, said Benjamin Ong, an assistant law professor at Singapore Management University. “Unfortunately, society tends to attach shame and stigma to being a victim of certain offences, such as sexual offences,” he added.\\nOng said there should not be a blanket rule on the types of information covered by a gag order. He noted that while naming schools could lead to the identification of a victim, it might also pose little to no risk in some cases and be beneficial to the public interest.\\nHe suggested that the law be changed to allow victims to request the lifting of a gag order, and for the court to weigh various factors – such as public interest and whether the victim fully understood the consequences – before deciding to accept the request.\\nThe option to lift the anonymity should remain for life, Ong added.\\nWhen you legislate, accountability is enshrined\\nCindy Tay, Children’s Aid Society’s director of home\\n“There are cases where people were sexually abused when they were children and were initially anonymous, but then they had the gag orders lifted after they became adults. It may have been many years after the incident, but it was still part of telling their story.”\\nCindy Tay, director of home at Children’s Aid Society, said when considering lifting a gag order, one must always prioritise the victim’s well-being. “Any exposure that compromises their physical or psychological safety would be deeply concerning,” she said.\\nIdentification is not the only way to hold stakeholders accountable, and the establishment of an independent review panel should be considered for all fatality and near-fatality cases involving young victims of abuse, according to Tay.\\nThe panel should not only identify lapses and provide recommendations to improve the system, but also monitor follow-up actions and compliance with its recommendations, she added.\\n“When you legislate, accountability is enshrined,” she said. “Given the tragic outcomes in these cases, this is the right step to safeguard children and strengthen the system.”\\n*Name changed to protect identity\\n",
