            "title": "CXMT begins producing advanced LPDDR5X memory chips as China narrows tech gap",
            "description": "ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), China’s leading memory chipmaker, has started mass production of a new generation of DRAM products in the latest sign of the country’s advancing semiconductor capabilities.\\nThe Hefei-based company, which is preparing for an initial public offering in Shanghai, announced on its official website that it had begun producing LPDDR5X – an advanced type of DRAM widely used in mobile devices.\\nDRAM chips function as high-speed memory in artificial intelligence systems, allowing rapid storage and access to the vast amounts of data required for AI model training and inference.\\nCXMT’s move marks its entry into the global arena for advanced memory chips, a market long dominated by South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, as well as US-based Micron Technology.\\nThe company’s LPDDR5X range includes chips with speeds of 8,533 Mbps, 9,600 Mbps and 10,667 Mbps. Mass production of the first two models began in May, while the fastest version was currently in the “customer sampling” stage, CXMT said in the statement.\\nThe LPDDR5X series is an upgrade on CXMT’s LPDDR5 line-up, offering faster data transfer rates and lower power consumption. The firm launched its LPDDR5 family in 2023, including 12Gb dies and 6GB and 12GB mobile DRAM packages.\\n\\nSamsung in April last year unveiled an LPDDR5X DRAM that it said achieved industry-leading performance of up to 10.7 Gbps, and began mass production of its 12-nanometre LPDDR5X DRAM packages in August last year.\\nCXMT’s latest products underscore the company’s ambition to boost its supply of high-end memory chips amid a global shortage driven by soaring AI demand.\\nGlobal DRAM industry revenue rose 17.1 per cent quarter on quarter to US$31.63 billion in the second quarter, fuelled by higher contract prices for conventional DRAM and expanding shipments of high-bandwidth memory, according to consultancy TrendForce.\\nThe announcement also comes as CXMT moves closer to a long-anticipated IPO on the mainland. The company aimed to list in Shanghai as early as the first quarter of 2026, seeking a valuation of up to 300 billion yuan (US$41 billion), Reuters reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter.\\nIn July, CXMT filed for IPO counselling with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a required step before companies can seek a domestic listing.\\nFounded in 2016, the company has advanced its manufacturing to the 16-nm process with a new 16-gigabit DDR5 chip, narrowing the technology gap with industry leaders, according to a January report by semiconductor research firm TechInsights.\\n",

            "description": "About 3.7 million candidates have been approved to take China’s coming national public service exam, according to official figures – a record-breaking applicant pool, and the first since Beijing expanded the age limit for entry into the country&apos;s civil sector, where jobs are known as “iron rice bowls” for their comparatively high level of security.\\nWith 38,100 vacancies available at central government agencies and their affiliated institutions nationwide, the competition is fierce, translating to an average of 98 applicants in contention for each position.\\nLast year&apos;s exams saw 3.4 million approved applicants vying for 39,700 jobs, though only 2.6 million of them ended up sitting for the tests.\\nDespite issues such as delayed wages and reduced benefits in some localities, civil service positions have remained sought after in China&apos;s soft labour market due to their stability relative to the private sector.\\nThe exams will be held on November 29 and 30, with results scheduled to be released in January, and interviews taking place later.\\nThis marks the first civil service recruitment drive since Beijing raised the maximum hiring age for some positions amid a shrinking workforce.\\n\\n\\nThe upper age limit for general candidates sitting the public service exams has been raised to 38 years from 35, while the threshold for recent recipients of master’s and doctoral degrees has been raised to 43 from 40.\\nWhile the move offers slight relief to older workers – who have frequently complained of a “curse of 35” limiting their prospects through informal avenues of age discrimination – it has also fuelled anxieties among young people who are already struggling to find positions in line with their skills and expectations.\\nAlice Xu, one of the 3.7 million, said she was worried the new policy could mean even lower chances of success.\\n“The number of people competing for each position has increased, and older candidates might be more experienced than us fresh college graduates,” said the native of Henan province who just earned her bachelor’s degree in law.\\nAfter an unsuccessful job search over the past few months with state enterprises and banks, she is now seeking temporary employment while she studies for the exam and awaits her results.\\nChina’s urban unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24, excluding students, stood at 17.7 per cent in September, following a record graduation season in which 12.2 million degree holders entered the labour market. In the same month, the overall urban jobless rate stood at 5.2 per cent.\\n",

            "title": "From reluctant novice to Games gold medallist, Halliday’s journey a sea tale worth telling",
            "description": "Sailing was never Nicholas Halliday’s first love, with his mother the driving force that initially got him onto the sea and on Wednesday made him a National Games gold medallist.\\nThe 26-year-old claimed the ILCA 7 title in the waters around the city of Shanwei, and then admitted it was on land that he felt most at home when he was a child.\\n“At that time, I didn’t think I really liked sailing,” he said. “I enjoyed the feeling on the rugby fields and basketball courts more.”\\nHalliday’s journey to the podium began around the age of eight or nine, when his mother Suzanna, a keen sailor, consistently enrolled him in training courses with the Hebe Dragons, where he shared a private coach with other youngsters.\\nThings changed quickly though. From a child who was not fond of going out onto the sea, Halliday’s love for the sport developed through the friendships he made and when he began to show his potential.\\n\\nFrom being determined to be on the court, he would even turn down game invitations from his basketball coach, just so he could take part in the sailing team’s training at weekends.\\nBorn on June 18, 1999, in Hong Kong to American parents Brian and Suzanna Bezy from San Diego, the King George V School graduate was raised in the city, and at 15 began to represent his home competitively.\\nThree years later, he was selected to represent Hong Kong at the Asian Games in Jakarta, and that was when his Chinese name, pronounced Bei Jun-long, was decided “in a matter of minutes”.\\n“I was 18 and wanted to go to the Asian Games, so I changed my passport and wanted to have a Chinese name,” Halliday said in an interview last year before the Paris Olympics. “I came down to Hong Kong Sports Institute and talked to my strength trainer, and we sat down and came up with this name.\\n“We felt Long [which means ‘dragon’ in Chinese] sounded cool, it also felt good to be handsome [yingjun], so we went with Jun, and Bei was a direct translation from my previous last name Bezy.”\\nHalliday officially changed his surname to that of his Scottish stepfather, Cameron Halliday, after the Asian Games in Hangzhou.\\nAfter finishing seventh in Indonesia, a pair of bronze medals followed at the ASAF Asian Sailing Championships and ILCA Asian Open Championship in February and December 2022, but an Asian Games medal remained elusive, with Halliday finishing just outside the podium places in Hangzhou a year later.\\nThe wind appeared to be on his side thereafter. In December 2023, the then 24-year-old Halliday finished first at the Asian Sailing Championships in Pattaya, which doubled as a Continental qualifier for the Paris Olympics, to become the first sailor from Hong Kong to qualify for the men’s single dinghy event at any Games.\\n“[Qualifying for the Olympics has] been a goal of mine since I was a kid – I’ve been trying to go for it since Tokyo,” Halliday said last year. “It’s my first time. I don’t really have any expectations, except just to give it the best I got.\\n“I’m just going to see where I end up from there, and learn as much as I can from the top competitors.”\\nAfter finishing 24th, among 43 sailors worldwide, at the Marseille Marina last summer, Halliday added a runner-up finish and a winner medal at the ILCA Asian &amp; Open Championships last December and in June, with a historic win on the Sailing Grand Slam circuit, contested between Olympic sailors, sandwiched between.\\nLooking ahead, his overarching goal is to improve significantly on his showing at the Paris Olympics at the next Games in Los Angeles in 2028.\\n“Sailing is just one person facing the sea, the wind, and their opponents,” said Halliday. “We have no idea what we will face next, and don’t know what we’ll get.\\n“We can only do our best to control and get what we want.”\\n",

            "title": "Indonesia’s Prabowo turns to podcasts for reality check: ‘am I really authoritarian?’",
            "description": "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has admitted watching podcasts about himself on his smartphone at night – and while some of the portrayals irk him, he believes that criticism is good for keeping politicians like him in check.\\n“Sometimes at night, I watch podcasts. And yes, some of them can be irritating. I find myself thinking: ‘What is this?’ But I take note anyway,” Prabowo said at a National Police event on Wednesday, as quoted by Tempo news magazine.\\nOne of the recurring claims about the former general is that he is authoritarian, a charge he has denied. “I watch those podcasts and ask myself: ‘Am I really authoritarian?’ I don’t think so,” he said with a smile, according to the Jakarta Globe newspaper.\\nPrabowo said the podcasts helped him reflect, noting that politicians who did not listen to criticism were easily led astray.\\n“I have a philosophy that in serving the nation, we must not be driven by anger or resentment,” he said, according to Kompas newspaper. “When I’m attacked, I tell the younger generation who aspire to become presidents: don’t be afraid of slander. Don’t ignore correction.”\\n\\n\\nHe developed this positive attitude towards criticism and slander while in school. “I was slandered about two to three times. I was so down I complained to a teacher,” he said, according to news portal Detik.\\nThe teacher told him: “Don’t lose heart. If people slander you, it means you’re being noticed, maybe even feared. Take it as a sign to stay alert.”\\nThis is not the first time the Indonesian president has spoken about learning from podcasts. At the Indonesian Solidarity Party Congress on July 20, he said he often checked social media and podcasts about him.\\n“I sometimes scroll through social media at night and watch podcasts to see what people are saying about me. Funny thing is, sometimes they seem to know more about Prabowo than I do,” he joked, as quoted by Tempo.\\nDespite his lighthearted attempt to shrug off his naysayers, Prabowo’s administration has come under fire in recent times.\\nOf the 976 respondents who voted for Prabowo and Vice-President Gibran Rakabuming Raka last year, only 643 said they would do so again, the Centre of Economic and Law Studies revealed on Saturday.\\nThe centre attributed the 34 per cent drop to dissatisfaction over economic performance, governance and law enforcement, the Jakarta Globe reported.\\nIn September, Prabowo had to replace five ministers in a lightning cabinet reshuffle after deadly protests erupted over ministerial pay.\\n\\nAnother ongoing issue is his flagship free meals programme for students and pregnant women, which has been plagued by a spate of food poisoning cases since it rolled out in January. As of Wednesday, 15,000 children had fallen ill, Reuters reported, citing data from a non-governmental organisation known locally as JPPI.\\nPrabowo defended it on October 18, saying that out of the 1.4 billion meals distributed nationwide, there were 8,000 cases of food poisoning reported. “That’s about 0.0007 or 0.0008 per cent, which means the programme has been 99.99 per cent successful,” he said, according to Antara news agency.\\n“So far, a few thousand children have suffered mild food poisoning, but what gets amplified is the poisoning issue – as if the entire programme should be stopped.”\\nDespite this, the president remains popular with Indonesians. According to a Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) poll released earlier this month, public satisfaction with Prabowo’s performance stood at 74.8 per cent.\\n“Although the satisfaction rate has declined compared to January and June 2025, remaining above 70 per cent is a positive signal for the government,” LSI Executive Director Adjie Alfarabi said, as quoted by the Jakarta Globe.\\n",

            "description": "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said Seoul aimed to work with Beijing to advance practical cooperation in trade, supply chains and people-to-people exchanges to improve ties based on “friendly competition” and “equal cooperation”.\\nLee made the remarks in an interview with China’s state-run Xinhua news agency published a day ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s arrival in the South Korean city of Busan on Thursday. This marks Xi’s first visit to South Korea in 11 years, following his last trip in July 2014.\\nLee is expected to hold a summit with Xi on Saturday in the coastal city of Gyeongju on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.\\nIn the interview, Lee expressed hopes of advancing the “mature development” of bilateral ties, while noting that as China’s industrial competitiveness and hi-tech capabilities rose sharply, competition between businesses in the two countries had grown.\\n“However, I believe South Korea and China can pool wisdom to mature and advance the strategic partnership based on ‘friendly competition’ and ‘equal cooperation’,” he said, according to the Xinhua report.\\n“In particular, I believe there is an urgent need to explore new complementary cooperation models in economic and trade sectors to further energise enterprises and industries in both countries.”\\nXi’s visit comes as Seoul finds itself caught in the middle of a deepening US-China rivalry. While South Korea relies on the US for security protection, China is its biggest trading partner.\\nOn the sidelines of the Apec summit on Thursday, Xi held talks with his American counterpart Donald Trump in their first in-person meeting since the latter’s return to the White House earlier this year.\\n\\nIn the Xinhua interview, Lee highlighted the importance of promoting mutually beneficial trade and supply chain collaboration and delivering tangible benefits for the peoples of both countries.\\nSeoul also aims to expand practical cooperation in areas such as culture, environment and people-to-people exchanges while addressing regional security issues, including denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, according to Lee.\\nIn recent years, China’s strengthened manufacturing capabilities have put South Korean shipbuilders and carmakers under pressure. Meanwhile, Seoul has increasingly aligned itself with Washington on hi-tech industries, particularly semiconductors.\\nIn the past two years, Chinese shipbuilders have secured about 70 per cent of new vessel orders globally, while South Korea’s market share has fallen to an eight-year low, according to a research institute affiliated with China State Shipbuilding Corporation.\\nSouth Korean brands Hyundai and Kia have lost market share to Chinese electric car producers.\\nLee said that the two sides could expand consultation channels for economic and trade cooperation and accelerate negotiations to achieve progress in the investment sector.\\n“The two countries agree that supply chain cooperation should continue to be strengthened, and through this consensus, the peoples of both countries will directly benefit,” Lee said in the interview.\\nSouth Korea is one of the few developed nations to have signed a free trade deal with China. It, together with Japan, is also a member of the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\\nNoting that he had visited China multiple times, Lee said that “China’s rich culture and economic development have left a profound impression on me and allow me to envision a bright future for South Korea–China relations”.\\nHe added that it was especially important for the two countries’ leaders to deepen political trust and maintain strategic communication through mutual visits.\\nRegarding the situation on the Korean peninsula, Lee stated that Seoul would strengthen strategic communication with Beijing.\\n“For substantive solutions to the nuclear problem and the construction of peace on the Korean peninsula, we urgently need China to play a constructive role,” he said.\\nAs for the Apec summit, Lee noted that most of the forum’s members faced common challenges and could improve cooperation and dialogue.\\nHe said that when it came to artificial intelligence (AI) and addressing demographic changes, the efforts of a single economy were limited.\\n“The best solutions emerge when all parties gather, share exemplary policies and discuss diverse policy options,” he said.\\n“I will work closely with Apec members, including China, to make Apec not only a forum for trade and investment discussions but also a multilateral platform for future economic and trade issues such as AI and demographic change.”\\n",

            "title": "Is Asean’s ‘meek diplomacy’ sufficient to end Myanmar conflict?",
            "description": "As the 47th Asean summit came to a close this week, questions remained over the bloc’s handling of the Myanmar crisis and whether it had done enough to bring peace to the war-torn country.\\nThe three-day summit saw the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations discuss various issues, including the ongoing clashes between Myanmar’s junta and opposition forces. Several members also signed trade deals with the United States.\\n“Myanmar was lower on the agenda at the summit compared with other pressing regional economic and strategic issues, such as trade, security cooperation and managing US-China competition,” Vu Lam, a policy analyst and Asean observer, told This Week in Asia.\\n“Consequently, the political will and capital to address the Myanmar issue were understandably inadequate.”\\nIn a statement issued by the bloc, the region’s foreign ministers upheld the previously agreed five-point consensus as its “main reference for addressing the political crisis in Myanmar” and urged “its full implementation to help the people of Myanmar achieve an inclusive and durable peaceful resolution”.\\nIt called for “all parties and stakeholders ... to de-escalate violence and stop targeted attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure and enhance trust-building efforts”, alongside the full implementation of an expanded ceasefire as reaffirmed by an earlier statement put out by the bloc in May.\\n\\nMyanmar’s junta has largely ignored the five-point consensus, prompting Asean to ban the country’s military leadership from most of its meetings. Instead, Naypyidaw has been sending non-political representatives to Asean’s meetings, including at this year’s summit.\\nThe impasse between Asean and Myanmar is a reflection of consensus being the bloc’s sole instrument with which to address the crisis, according to Moe Thuzar, Myanmar studies programme coordinator at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\\nTop diplomats from Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines were set to fly to Myanmar in August to discuss plans by the junta to hold its first general election later this year, but the trip was reportedly postponed.\\nWhile Myanmar had invited Asean to send observers to the polls, the bloc did not reach a consensus at its recently concluded summit and reportedly left its members to make decisions on the mission individually.\\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr confirmed that the bloc had “carefully discussed” deploying a monitoring team, but said “Asean is leaving it to each country to decide on their own”.\\n“Asean will not take a common position, because in our discussions, everyone has a different idea,” he said on Tuesday.\\n\\nAccording to Thuzar, the move likely reflects Asean’s apprehension about the election, with the result “unlikely to be automatically accepted as a fait accompli” by the bloc.\\nMyanmar has been plagued by civil unrest and conflict over the past four years, leaving more than 7,000 killed, 30,000 imprisoned and hundreds of thousands more displaced.\\nThe country’s elected leader, 80-year-old Aung San Suu Kyi, has been in military custody since her government was overthrown by the junta in a 2021 coup. Her son has said her health is deteriorating and there are fears she might die soon.\\nThe the junta-led government controls less than half of the country, with critics accusing the military of increasing human rights violations.\\nAt the Asean summit, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the junta government to focus on providing aid to its people instead of its election. “I don’t think anybody believes that those elections will be free and fair,” he said. “I don’t think anybody believes those elections will contribute to the solution of the problems of Myanmar.”\\n\\n\\n‘Meek diplomatic response’\\nBridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham Malaysia who specialises in Southeast Asian politics, warned that Myanmar was “on the verge of a sham election” and said Asean “should have fundamentally condemned the polls”.\\n“Asean failed the Myanmar people again, choosing a diplomatic path rather than a principled one that put pressure on the junta ... Asean is going through the motions and being played by the junta who use Asean for legitimacy,” she told This Week in Asia.\\nWelsh said the five-point consensus was “no longer relevant”, adding that it was an “excuse to engage, but the substance of engagement has yet to meaningfully address the crisis”.\\nWith the Philippines taking over as Asean chair in 2026, all eyes will be on Manila and its handling of the Myanmar crisis.\\nThuzar said that the Philippines would likely seek to maintain the diplomatic momentum from 2025, including a proposal initiated by Asean this year for a more inclusive and comprehensive engagement with Myanmar stakeholders, including the appointment of a special envoy.\\n\\nBut the Philippines may face similar constraints as Asean’s current chair Malaysia, according to Lam.\\n“There are stronger measures available. However, without broader shifts in Asean cohesion and consensus-building, meaningful progress is beyond any single chair’s effort,” he said.\\nApart from installing a special envoy, Welsh urged Asean to ensure more inclusive representation of Myanmar’s opposition forces and take a harder line against the junta.\\n“Let’s see if the Philippines has any democratic principles, as Malaysia chose to meet the junta and not defend the Myanmar people adequately,” she said.\\n“They also allowed the scam economy to deepen, putting the region and the world more at risk. Again, a meek diplomatic response has caused harm.”\\n",

            "description": "Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon’s critically acclaimed Apple TV+ drama The Morning Show has a reputation for keeping fans on the edge of their seats with every episode. The show pulls back the curtain on the titular fictional morning news programme, offering a biting critique of the TV journalism industry.\\nSeason four of The Morning Show premiered in September, and the stakes have never been higher. Reflecting the current rise of new media, the series introduces the character of Brodie “Bro” Hartman, a conservative podcaster played by Boyd Holbrook, into the mix. The talk show host has a massive following and shares a complex, sexually charged dynamic with Aniston’s character, Alex Levy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by Prime Video (@primevideo)\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter at the premiere of season four, Holbrook described his character as an “antithesis to legacy media” with “zero editorial oversight”. The actor – who you may have seen on the small screen in Narcos or The Sandman, or on the big screen in Logan (2017) or A Complete Unknown (2024) – is quickly establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with.\\nSo what else do we know about him? Read on to find out.\\nBoyd Holbrook’s family\\n\\nRobert Boyd Holbrook, 44, was born in Prestonsburg, in the US state of Kentucky. Speaking to Interview magazine, he revealed that his father Don “[ran] a bulldozer all of his life”, while his mother Ellen worked in real estate. He was once engaged to actress Elizabeth Olsen, and is now married to Danish actress Tatiana Pajkovic, with whom he shares two children.\\nHow did he get into acting?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by VESTAL (@vestalmag)\\n\\n\\n\\nHolbrook was inspired to pursue acting by the 1998 drama film Slam, he told Interview magazine. The Big C star received formal training at film school, learning from teachers at New York University and Columbia University, though he did not complete his degree. His tuition fees came from working graveyard shifts for UPS before he dropped out. Holbrook then joined a theatre company at the advice of fellow actor Michael Shannon, starting out as a carpenter before he began acting. He made his screen debut in Gus Van Sant’s Milk (2008). During a conversation with Harper’s Bazaar, Holbrook shared that the director had rejected a screenplay he sent him, offering him the role of Denton Smith instead.\\nHe’s a man of many talents\\n\\nBefore getting his big break as an actor, Holbrook was a model working with brands like Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Jean Paul Gaultier, Moschino, Dior and DKNY to help pay for university. He had a passion for art and basketball, and wanted to become an architect, he told Interview magazine. He even did an apprenticeship with sculptor Fernando Mastrangelo in New York. Holbrook has written screenplays, made his directorial debut with the 2015 short film Peacock Killer, and is interested in photography and making music.\\n",

            "description": "Wheelchair-using Taiwanese singer Zheng Zhihua has complained that staff at an airport in China left him to “roll and climb into a plane”.\\nThe entertainer raised a red flag in a bid to boost awareness over a general lack of accessibility for the disabled.\\nZheng, 63, is famous in the Chinese world after the two songs written and performed by him, Sailor and Star Lighting, became hits in the 1990s.\\nHe has used a wheelchair for a lengthy period after being diagnosed with polio at the age of two.\\n\\nThe inspirational song Sailor pays tribute to life’s resilient characters, and Zheng is somewhat of an icon among the disabled.\\nOn October 25, Zheng said on social media platform that Shenzhen Airport in southern China was “cruel to disabled people”.\\nHe said that he was made to board a plane parked at a remote stand, and while he was boarding, the lift that carried his wheelchair stopped when there was still a 25cm gap between the platform and the doorstep of the plane.\\nAs a result, he had to “roll and climb into the plane”.\\nZheng complained that the lift lorry’s driver disregarded his safety, adding that he could not tolerate such “inhumane behaviour and attitudes”.\\n\\nWithin nine hours of Zheng’s social media post, Shenzhen Airport had apologised and promised to improve accessibility for the disabled.\\nThe airport said the incident happened while Zheng was boarding a Shenzhen Airlines flight to Taipei.\\nThe airport said that safety protocols require the boarding vehicle to maintain a 20cm difference from the plane’s door, to prevent equipment from scraping the aircraft.\\nThe airport promised that starting from October 25, they will make sure people using wheelchairs are catered for properly. They also vowed to boost staffing.\\nZheng accepted the airport’s apology and thanked its staff.\\n\\nHe said he wanted to raise awareness about accessibility for disabled people.\\nIn a separate post, he recalled that he was asked by security staff to put a metal support for his feet through the scanning machine in Nanjing Airport in eastern China’s Jiangsu province.\\n“I have been to more than a hundred airports around the world and have never been treated like this before,” Zheng wrote.\\nHe said he was passionate about singing and performing all over the world, but the airports’ “malice” made him think about retirement.\\n“The economy and technology develop, but sympathy and kindness with each other have gone,” he said.\\nAn online observer who also has a leg disability agreed with Zheng.\\n“I had a similar experience. Barrier-free facilities in public spaces still need improvement. Also, service staff’s awareness of accessibility for the disabled needs to be raised.”\\n",

            "description": "The second season of Kristen Bell and Adam Brody’s hit romcom series Nobody Wants This has landed on Netflix, and it is already the most-watched English-language TV show on the platform. While fans are overjoyed to see the return of their favourite couple, Joanne (Bell) and Noah (Brody), another pair on the show is going through a rough patch.\\n\\nIn season two, Noah’s brother Sasha and his wife Esther, played by Timothy Simons and Jackie Tohn respectively, decide to part ways after their marriage sours. The fact that Sasha is a little too close to Joanne’s sister Morgan, played by Justine Lupe, doesn’t help matters.\\nCalling his character the “perfect guy”, Simons told People, “I don’t see anything wrong with what he’s doing.” The Veep star explained, “It doesn’t always work out, and maybe it still will, but right now is that weird part. And we’re putting it on TV.”\\n\\nIn real life, Timothy Charles Simons is a devoted family man. He hosts the Second in Command podcast, enjoys golfing and, as he told Uproxx, he is an aspiring writer.\\nSo what else do we know about him? Read on to find out.\\nTimothy Simons’ family\\n\\nTimothy Simons, 47, was born in Readfield, in the US state of Maine. He grew up in an Irish Catholic family, he revealed to Uproxx, but religion wasn’t a major factor of his upbringing. His family had a photography business, his father Ron being the photographer and his mother Susan handling the finances. She later started working with the adult education programme at her son’s high school.\\nSimons comes from a creative family. As he told Interview magazine, his brother plays bluegrass mandolin, while his sister is a writer and poet.\\nHow did he get into acting?\\n\\nSimons first ventured into acting while studying at the University of Maine because he wanted to meet new people, he told Uproxx. Some of his first auditions were for 10-minute plays, but these experiences were enough to convince him to switch majors from physics to theatre, per Interview magazine. After interning with a Kentucky-based theatre group for children, he briefly worked as a casting camera operator and session director for commercials. His big break came with the Julia Louis-Dreyfus vehicle Veep, and he has since appeared in shows like Looking for Alaska and The Handmaid’s Tale.\\nHe’s a father of twins\\n\\nSimons married his wife Annie in 2008, per Elle. She went on to work for more than a decade as a theatre instructor. The pair met in Chicago, and had twins – a girl and a boy – in 2011. Earlier this month, the family of four attended the Los Angeles season two premiere of Nobody Wants This.\\n",
