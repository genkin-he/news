            "title": "Photos of glass lift being built on Bali’s iconic ‘dinosaur’ cliff spark outrage",
            "description": "A glass lift being built into one of Bali’s most photographed cliffs has triggered outrage from locals and travellers after viral photos showed construction piercing through the island’s iconic Kelingking Beach – a site often nicknamed the “T-Rex” or “dinosaur” cliff for its striking shape.\\nThe 182-metre-high lift and adjoining 64-metre bridge are being built by Chinese developer China Kaishi Group to replace the steep and often treacherous hike down to the beach on Nusa Penida, a small island off Bali’s southeast coast. The project is valued at more than 10 million yuan (US$1.4 million).\\nBut when images of the lift shaft cutting through the iconic ridge began circulating online this week, many Indonesians were quick to denounce the project as a violation of the island’s natural beauty.\\nCaptioning a before and after photo of the cliff, social media user pendakilawas wrote: “Honestly, it looks so ugly, it reminds me of a foreigner who said he went to Bali or Indonesia’s natural attractions not to enjoy 5-star hotels or any luxurious facilities, but to purely enjoy the beauty of nature.”\\n\\nJujur Jadi jeleek banget, jadi teringat ada bule yang bilang dia ke bali atau wisata alam Indonesia bukan untuk menikmati hotel bintang 5 atau fasilitas mewah apapun itu, tapi menikmati murni keindahan alam\\nKelingking Beach, Nusa Penida, Bali pic.twitter.com/jclM7WSCw6\\n— pendakilawas (@pendakilawas) October 27, 2025\\n\\n“It’s a shame that the beautiful view of Kelingking Beach has been destroyed by the lift project,” local resident Made Sediana told the Bali Sun newspaper. “Tourists come to Nusa Penida to enjoy the beautiful panorama, not the lifts.”\\nHe questioned the need for easier beach access at all, noting that Kelingking is a no-swim zone where accidents are common. Safety concerns were renewed after an October 15 drowning involving a French tourist who entered the water despite warnings from lifeguards.\\n“Many tourists experience accidents because they go down,” Sediana said. “If it were easier for guests to go down, it would be dangerous too. The coastline is narrow there, and big waves come suddenly. The best way to enjoy Kelingking Beach’s beauty is from above.”\\nApart from the environmental impact, many also expressed concern about the project’s permits and licences.\\nIn response, Bali Governor I Wayan Koster confirmed on Thursday that he would be looking deeper into the licensing and permits situation to see if there are any violations, The Bali Sun reported. “If violations are serious, it’s closed.”\\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Tourism has likewise sought to calm public anger, saying it has been supervising the project in coordination with local authorities since the planning stage in 2023.\\n“The Ministry of Tourism also encourages the lift developers to apply green construction standards during the construction process, and in the future, to utilise technology that uses renewable energy sources to minimise the impact of global warming,” Hariyanto, the ministry’s deputy for destination development and infrastructure, said as quoted by Tempo magazine.\\nHe added that the lift could become a new attraction to boost visitor numbers and the average length of stay on Nusa Penida.\\nThus far, construction had not affected the number of visits to Nusa Penida, he said, citing data from the Klungkung Regency Tourism Office that showed a significant increase in the number of tourists visiting the area – from 714,335 in 2023 to 1,108,791 in 2024.\\n\\n“Looking ahead, tourist visits are expected to remain high, even as the construction of the lift continues. This optimism is supported by Nusa Penida’s global achievements as the best beach in the world, as recognised by Tripadvisor in 2024 and Trip Best 2025 Global Water Fun Attraction by Trip.com,” he said.\\n“In addition, with a daily average of around 3,000 to 6,000 tourist visits, the Klungkung Regency government is optimistic that the target of 1.5 million tourist visits can be achieved by 2025.”\\nOverdevelopment has become a major issue in Bali, especially after flash floods in September caused the Indonesian government to declare a state of emergency on the island.\\nMore than 4.6 million foreigners visited Bali from January to August this year, according to Agence France-Presse, outnumbering the island’s 4.4 million residents.\\nThe infrastructure catering to them has prompted “land conversion, chaotic urban management and lax enforcement of spatial planning laws”, Made Krisna Dinata, executive director of non-governmental organisation Walhi Bali, told the news agency.\\nIn the wake of the floods, Governor Koster moved to curb runaway construction by banning the conversion of agricultural land into commercial developments such as villas, restaurants and hotels, The Jakarta Post reported.\\n",

            "description": "The UN human rights chief said on Friday that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organisation.\\nRavina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Turk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\\nShe said Turk believed “air strikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.\\nShamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counterterrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\\nIntentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life”, she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”\\nThe strikes took place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.\\n",

            "title": "Beyond a trade deal: are more Xi-Trump summits the pathway to a new era of stability?",
            "description": "The world’s two largest powers signalled at least 14 months of likely stability in US-China relations following a pivotal summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump – and hinted they would meet “regularly”, setting the stage for more encounters next year.\\nWith a trade deal expected to be signed as soon as next week, Beijing and Washington reached a truce on thorny issues ranging from soybeans and rare earths to fentanyl during talks that highlighted the personal connection between the two leaders and struck a conciliatory tone for long-term ties.\\nMinutes after the high-stakes meeting in South Korea, Trump told reporters on Thursday that both sides had agreed that he would visit China in April and that Xi was also expected to visit Palm Beach or Washington “some time after that”.\\nBeijing’s official release later confirmed that Trump looked forward to visiting China “early next year” and that Xi had been invited to visit the US.\\n\\n\\n“The two presidents agreed to maintain interactions on a regular basis,” said the Chinese statement issued by the state news agency Xinhua.\\nAccording to the statement, Trump said that since China would host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ gathering in 2026 and the US will host the Group of 20 summit later next year, Washington expected both “to be successful”.\\nThe two annual events would provide opportunities for the two heads of state to engage in person again, though attendance has yet to be confirmed.\\n“Both sides agreed to support each other in striving for positive outcomes at both summits,” said a commentary published on Friday by the official People’s Daily in China.\\nThe article – written under the byline Zhong Sheng, a pseudonym meaning “Voice of the Centre” – claimed that the Xi-Trump meeting was widely viewed as sending a “positive” signal to the world, “injecting new momentum into the stable development of China-US relations”.\\n“Positive interactions between the two countries on regional and world platforms are key to addressing the ever-emerging global challenges,” the article added, echoing Xi’s message to Trump during their conversation.\\n\\nSpecific dates for the 2026 Apec summit have not been announced, but recent meetings have taken place in October or November, suggesting the possibility that the conference could serve as a platform for Trump to visit China again after April.\\nTrump, however, skipped this year’s Apec leaders’ gathering in Gyeongju, South Korea, in a move reflecting his long-standing disdain for multilateral forums.\\nStill, the America first president announced in September his plan to host the G20 leaders’ summit – reportedly scheduled for December 2026 – at his Doral golf club near Miami, after missing this year’s event in South Africa.\\nIt remained to be seen whether next year’s summit would coincide with a reciprocal visit by Xi to the other side of the Pacific Ocean or provide an opportunity for the Chinese leader to make multiple US trips next year.\\n“I think the Chinese realised that with President Trump in office, it is an opportunity to reset the relationship in terms of mutual respect,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told FOX Business on Thursday in an interview after the bilateral summit.\\nThe two presidents were able to focus more on “bigger picture ideas” during their discussions, including what the remainder of Trump’s term would look like, Bessent added.\\nThe “next 14 months” could be consumed with preparations for Trump’s visit to China and Xi’s potential US trip for the G20 summit, according to Melanie Hart, senior director of the Washington-based Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\\n“China’s biggest concern with Trump is his unpredictability, and they are using an extraordinary line-up of pre-scheduled 2026 meetings to box him in and force a degree of, if not quite predictability, at least plannability in US-China relations,” Hart said in a note on Thursday.\\n“Trump’s planned visit to Beijing gives China the opportunity to script the next interaction and to press for a new wave of US concessions over the coming months to lay groundwork for a ‘good’ meeting,” she added.\\nStill, that could herald a more frequent pattern of face-to-face engagement between Chinese and US leaders compared with Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.\\nPartly disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the balloon incident, the former president never visited China during his four-year term, meeting Xi only three times: in Indonesia in 2022, the United States in 2023 and Peru in 2024.\\nDa Wei, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, said that the Xi-Trump summit marked “a narrow but important opportunity” for the two countries to enter “a new phase” of bilateral relations.\\n“The conditions are ripe for an inflection point in US-Chinese relations that could set a path towards a more stable and effective relationship,” he wrote in an article published in Foreign Affairs on Thursday.\\nIn a relationship characterised by “level-headed stability”, China and the US should regulate the intensity of the competition and establish clearer lines to demarcate where their economies and societies should interact and where they should be independent”, Da said.\\n“The two countries also need to recalibrate their geopolitical relations in the Indo-Pacific,” he added, calling on Washington and Beijing to de-escalate tensions around Taiwan.\\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\\n",

            "title": "For this Chinese whisky distillery, making a tipple with a local accent is about ‘balance’",
            "description": "To most people, “terroir” means the natural environment in which wines and whiskies are produced, and which gives them their unique characteristics.\\nTo Beijing-born whisky distiller Yang Tao, it can also mean the human spirit. He showcases this in The Chuan, “China’s first prestige malt whisky”, launched in mainland China in December 2023 and in Hong Kong in August 2025.\\nThe Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery sits at the base of Mount Emei, one of Buddhism’s four sacred mountains of China, in Sichuan province, two hours from Chengdu.\\nThe distillery, which is mainland China’s first prestige whisky maker, was launched by Pernod Ricard. Yang previously worked for the international spirits giant in Scotland before helping build the Chinese distillery.\\n\\n“We want to respect the tradition of whisky, but new elements are bound to emerge as whisky-making migrates to new environments,” Yang tells the Post.\\n“For example, whiskey made in the United States has a more wild, untethered and stimulating quality; Scotch whisky is clearer and more elegant, like a gentleman; Japanese whisky is soft and gentle, like sashimi.”\\nAs for The Chuan, Yang thinks it should possess a mild and moderate temperament, in line with the Taoist emphasis on harmony.\\nYang, who has worked in the spirits industry since 2006, says that China’s natural resources are the foundation of the distillery. From the water flowing down Mount Emei to the Danling oak – from the protected Changbai Mountains in northeastern China – used to make the barrels, they all help shape the whisky.\\nMany Chinese liquor producers have distilleries in Sichuan province or neighbouring Yunnan province, and Yang says this is because of the region’s terroir.\\n“Firstly, we are upstream of the Yellow River, which means the water is of higher quality. Secondly, it’s not windy here and the weather is relatively mild. Lastly, the humidity and light drizzle create an optimal environment for mushrooms and microorganisms.”\\nDetails such as these are explained in The Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery Experience Centre, beside the distillery.\\nThe complex, open to the public, was designed with sustainability in mind by Chinese architecture studio Neri &amp; Hu. Contemporary Chinese artist Zhan Wang’s steel sculptures, collectively titled Fractal Structure – Infinite Shan Shui, are thoughtfully installed throughout the site.\\nVisitors can take part in a 90-minute sensory walking tour to learn about The Chuan, from the meaning of its Chinese name – layers and rivers – to details about its logo, Mount Emei’s terroir, and the European and Chinese barley used to make the whisky.\\nThere is also an outdoor salon where visitors can touch the wood used to make the whisky barrels.\\n\\n\\nAs some of the first people to produce whisky in mainland China, Yang and his team found themselves in uncharted territory, which made choosing the right wood for their barrels a challenge.\\nThe team initially wanted to use Chinese oak casks, but many carpenters suggested using easier-to-find French oak.\\nToday, the casks in which The Chuan is matured are made of oak from various places. American bourbon casks imbue the spirit with coconut, vanilla and cream notes, while Spanish sherry casks add notes of toffee, raisin, nut and chocolate.\\nThe team did, however, persist in its pursuit of Chinese oak, jumping through legal hoops to harvest the Danling oak for its barrels.\\n“If we’re only going to use French wood, why don’t we just distil it in Europe?” Yang says. “We believe in making a Chinese whisky unique to China.”\\n\\nThe distillery now uses Danling oak trees that are 80 to 100 years old. They emit an enticing aroma of sandalwood and mandarin peel, contributing to The Chuan’s unmistakable Chinese character.\\n“Ultimately, it’s about a pursuit of beauty that is very Chinese. It’s about the balance in yin and yang and layering different aspects together to create something with smoothness and richness. The West has its philosophies, as do we, in things like our tea and cuisine,” Yang says.\\nThe team behind The Chuan – and many serious Chinese drinkers – poetically translate terroir to “wind and soil”, or fengtu in Mandarin. But fengtu carries a broader meaning beyond nature to encompass human traditions and experiences.\\nAccordingly, it is not just the ingredients, but the culture that surrounds it, that makes The Chuan quintessentially Chinese.\\nThis is reflected at The Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery Experience Centre, where tours begin with a small cup of tea. There is also a whisky tasting bar, a gift and coffee shop, and a restaurant called The Yan.\\n\\n\\nThe Yan was launched in collaboration with Art Yinba, a refined Sichuan restaurant in Chengdu, and takes advantage of the local terroir to create innovative dishes.\\nAt this Post writer’s visit in mid-October, the 14-course menu included a three-part Sichuan-inspired amuse-bouche with seasonal organic vegetables, another three-part appetiser including foie gras marinated in bourbon barrel-aged whisky and topped with caviar and wrapped in rice paper, a Danling oak-smoked pigeon with peppercorn and grilled pigeon innards, and a yak shoulder clod aged in oak-infused oil for 30 days.\\nNo fine-dining experience is complete without drink pairings, all of which were from The Chuan: a pure malt whisky, a Danling single oak whisky and a Pedro Ximénez sherry cask option to conclude the meal.\\nCurrently, only The Chuan’s pure malt whisky is for sale, but Yang says his team has been test-farming a new breed of barley in Sichuan and working towards using its own cultured yeast, which is still in the early development stage.\\n\\n\\nYang quips that he is thankful the distillery has not pressured him too much to make a single malt whisky, but he hopes to present it to the market in a few years.\\n“The goal is not to clash or compete with anything already on the market, but to fill in gaps and supplement what is already there,” he says. “I think it’s important to have diversity, and The Chuan is about sharing whisky culture here and promoting China pride to the world.”\\n",

            "title": "Like ‘Singapore’s Orchard Road?’ Malaysia’s plan for Bukit Bintang upgrade draws fire",
            "description": "A government plan to spend nearly US$1 million on decorative lights and other cosmetic upgrades in Kuala Lumpur’s famed Bukit Bintang district has drawn fierce backlash, with residents questioning the priorities of city planners as floods and ageing infrastructure continue to plague the Malaysian capital.\\nThe Housing and Local Government Ministry on Wednesday unveiled the “I Lite U” initiative – a 4 million ringgit (US$950,000) project to illuminate Bukit Bintang and spruce up its streets ahead of the Visit Malaysia Year 2026 tourism campaign.\\nMinister Nga Kor Ming said the goal was to make the entertainment district “no less than Ginza street in Tokyo or Orchard Road in Singapore”, with a parade “as good as Disneyland’s” planned for the official launch on January 3.\\nBut the plan was met with quick disapproval on Malaysia’s raucous social media, with dozens of comments reminding the minister of the constant fear of flash floods and deadly falling trees caused by increasingly unpredictable storms.\\n“So busy focusing on fun only. Fix the flooding first,” read a comment by one Iskandar Arshadi to a social media post on Nga’s announcement.\\n\\nOfficials, however, argue that a refreshed Bukit Bintang would help Kuala Lumpur remain competitive with other Asian shopping corridors, draw higher‑spending tourists and support businesses in the surrounding area, especially ahead of the country’s show‑piece tourism year.\\nNga said the lighting, cleaning and traffic measures were being coordinated with Kuala Lumpur City Hall and waste‑management agencies to keep the area clean and vibrant.\\nThe ministry has also linked the project to a wider push to create more nighttime attractions in the capital on the argument that tourists stay longer and spend more when there is a safe, well‑lit evening precinct.\\nYet for many Kuala Lumpur residents, the idea of evening strolls and late-night festivals rings hollow when basic infrastructure remains so vulnerable to extreme weather. Nearly a dozen roads were cut off by flash floods during evening peak-hour traffic in April, as rivers and storm water drainage systems around the city failed to contain the surge in rainfall during a storm.\\nAn estimated 1.5 million cars travel in and out of Kuala Lumpur daily and as many as 6 million cars are packed into the city on any given day, according to government data.\\nLast week, a man was killed and a woman injured in two separate incidents as a raging storm caused trees to fall on their cars while they were driving.\\nIt was the latest fatality caused by ageing trees in Kuala Lumpur. Last year, one person died and another was injured when a tree fell on 17 vehicles in the city centre.\\n\\nMalaysians have also slammed the government for its fixation on trying to rebrand Bukit Bintang into a copy of popular destinations in other countries, arguing that the district already has a “vibe” of its own.\\n“Tourists don’t fly to Kuala Lumpur to see another Orchard Road, they come for the KL vibe, the multilingual crowd, the contrast between old shophouses and new towers,” read a comment by one Zachary Chia. “Authenticity sells better than imitation.”\\nOthers suggested the government focus on increasing representation of the country’s diverse ethnic groups and cultures in Bukit Bintang instead of letting it become overrun by Arab shawarma restaurants and Chinese pulled noodle joints.\\n“No need to copy. Turn Bukit Bintang into the face of Malaysia,” said one Sazali Abu Bakar.\\nThe government has set aside a total budget of 700 million ringgit to promote Visit Malaysia Year 2026. It hopes to pull in 47 million foreign visitors and about 330 billion ringgit (US$78.2 billion) in tourism revenue next year.\\nMalaysia ranked as Southeast Asia’s top tourism destination so far this year, pulling in 28.2 million visitors over the first eight months of 2025, according to government data. It was a 14.5 per cent surge from a year earlier, driven by relaxed visa requirements for visitors from China and India.\\nIt outstripped the performance of regional rival Thailand, which saw its total visitor count fall 7 per cent to 21.8 million over the same period as Chinese nationals avoided the kingdom over fears that they could be targeted by crime syndicates.\\n",

            "title": "Link Hong Kong Open: Wu Ashun stays in hunt – and owes it all to local philanthropist",
            "description": "Before the age of 16, Wu Ashun had not picked up a golf club, let alone swung one in an attempt to hit a ball.\\nYet 24 years later he is playing in this week’s Link Hong Kong Open with multiple wins under his belt and a career that raised the bar for players in China.\\nAnd it might never have happened if not for a Hong Kong-based philanthropist called Wang Jiashui, or “Mommy”, as the 40-year-old refers to her.\\n“It 100 per cent definitely changed my life – oh man, I was lucky, I was very lucky,” Wu said.\\nWu was playing basketball at school in his hometown of Zhangzhou, in Fujian, when golf coach Jason Song Mingfeng arrived in 2001 looking to recruit players for a new academy.\\n\\nOf the 200-plus pupils who tried out and underwent “a lot of testing, like power testing, flexible testing or patience testing”, only 12 or 13 made the cut, Wu among them.\\nIt was then that Wu found out that everything was free. Food, coaching, education, all were supported by Wang – support that has continued throughout his career.\\nWu’s golfing education began in earnest, even if the surroundings were somewhat rustic. A patch of grass by the school was turned into a green, a rough patch of ground became a driving range, and the days were long.\\n“When I picked up the club, I couldn’t play,” Wu said. “I went to play a shot and the ball would still be there [on the ground]. We trained pretty hard. Running in the morning, waking up at 4.30am or 5am. It was pretty early.\\n“After breakfast, we would go to school to study. Then we would have golf lessons: how to grip the club, how to stand. Then at night we would learn the rules, and learn golf English, like what was a green, what was a birdie.”\\nWhen they had developed their skills to a certain level, the group would sling their clubs on their backs and walk some distance “to the real drive range”.\\n“We had to walk maybe 10km [6.2 miles] there to practise, [hit] maybe a couple of hundred balls, and walk back to the school, and that was summer time, so it was really hard,” Wu said.\\nIt was worth it. Wu turned professional just six years after first picking up a club, joining the Asian Tour in 2008. He won his first title at the Toshin Golf Tournament in Ryosen four years later, becoming the first Chinese player to win on the Japan Golf Tour.\\nMore history followed in 2015, when his Volvo China Open victory made him the first Chinese player to win a European Tour event on home soil. A decade later, another triumph in Shanghai was his fifth DP World Tour title.\\n“And everything happened from that lady we call Mommy,” Wu said. “She’s a great lady, and every time I come to Hong Kong, I will go to her house to have dinner or something, and she supported me from nothing to go to being a professional.\\n“A lot of people didn’t go professional, but she still supported them … going to college in America, they go to coach, they go to working on the golf course. And she always supports, she doesn’t care if you made it as a professional, so that’s great.”\\nThe pair will have plenty of time to catch up this year. Wu’s four-under-par 66 in Friday’s second round took him to seven under for the tournament, keeping him around for the weekend, although hauling in the leaders might be asking a lot.\\nTom McKibbin backed up his record-setting opening round of 60, with a 65 to reach the halfway stage at 15 under and with a two-shot cushion at the top of the leaderboard.\\nPeter Uihlein, meanwhile, briefly flirted with a magical 59. Having started his day on 11, he was nine under through 16 holes before disaster struck on the par-four ninth. A triple bogey ended that bid, and he finished with a 63 to sit on 13 under overall alongside Kiradech Aphibarnrat and Jazz Janewattananond.\\n",

            "description": "A 16-year-old boy has admitted joining a Taiwan-based political group to seek Hong Kong’s independence in breach of the national security law.\\nThe Form Three student pleaded guilty on Friday to conspiracy to commit secession between November 2024 and July this year for his role as secretary of the Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union.\\nThe District Court heard that the union, founded by fugitive activist Alan Keung Ka-wai, advocated Hong Kong’s “liberation” from mainland Chinese rule, sought international recognition for a self-proclaimed “Hong Kong Parliament” and supported the establishment of an army to “restore and defend” the city.\\nSome of the party’s members were sworn in as so-called members of parliament after an election earlier this year, with Keung serving as the pseudo-legislature’s chairman.\\nOn the day of the union’s founding on November 6 last year, the boy approached Keung via WhatsApp expressing his interest in joining the group and saying he could help with his analytical and public speaking skills.\\nText conversations retrieved from the student’s mobile phone show that he had advised on the union’s name and emblem design, as well as drafting its constitution and meeting agendas.\\nThe defendant had also distributed the party’s promotional materials online and discussed with fellow members how to drum up anti-communist sentiments abroad, establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan and “settle the score” with mainland investments in Hong Kong after the city achieved independence.\\nA prosecution summary of the case highlighted the group’s illegal activities included social media posts promoting the self-styled parliament’s election and a flash-mob protest in Taiwan calling for Hong Kong’s independence.\\nNational security police first arrested the boy in March this year on suspicion of sedition.\\nUnder caution, he admitted publishing posters calling for support for the union in the so-called parliament’s election, but insisted that he disagreed with their content and that he only wanted to trigger online discussions on the subjects.\\nThe student remained silent when he was rearrested in July.\\nOn Friday, defence counsel David Ma Wai-kwan urged the court to consider sentencing his client to a period of detention at a juvenile facility, saying the boy had become inactive in the union since his first arrest.\\nBut Judge Ernest Michael Lin Kam-hung said his options would be limited if he decided that the boy was an active participant in the conspiracy, which would warrant a minimum jail term of three years under the national security law’s three-tier sentencing regime.\\nMa highlighted the student’s naivety and questioned whether it was right to assess his role in the scheme simply based on his unrealistic proposals for the party.\\nThe court adjourned sentencing until November 27. The boy, who was previously granted anonymity due to his young age, remains detained at the Tuen Mun Children and Juvenile Home.\\nTwo other defendants – courier Chan Tai-sum, 26, and waiter Ng Chi-tung, 25 – have yet to indicate their pleas on the same conspiracy charge.

            "title": "China’s ‘tough’ trade war stance rests on industry but demand still vital: Morgan Stanley",
            "description": "China’s supply chain upgrades have strengthened its hand in negotiations with the United States and are expected to bolster its competitive edge over the next five years – though the country must prioritise domestic demand to sustain innovation and avoid worsening deflation, according to an influential economist.\\n“China is probably the only country that is negotiating in a tough way, almost on an equal foot[ing] versus [the] US,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, in an interview on Thursday. “That’s backed by China’s rising supply chain competitiveness and trade dominance”, he added, pointing to its near monopoly in crucial exports like lithium batteries and rare earths.\\n“In the next five years, China probably wants to continue to enhance what they have achieved,” Xing said.\\nBeijing on Tuesday released proposals for the 15th five-year plan – its socio-economic blueprint that outlines policy priorities for the next half-decade.\\nIndustrial and technological development featured prominently, with policymakers pledging to make a “decisive breakthrough” across the supply chains of critical industries – including semiconductors, infrastructure software and biomanufacturing.\\nThe proposals also called for maintaining a “reasonable” share of manufacturing in the economy while building a “unified domestic market” to underpin a new growth model. The central government vowed to tighten oversight of local economic initiatives, curb “race-to-the-bottom” competition and improve frameworks to evaluate performance, fiscal policy, statistics and benefit-sharing to support greater market integration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Xing, the document showed Beijing is recalibrating its industrial strategy to strike a balance between supply and demand – a likely shift from the current model, where local authorities offer subsidies to attract as much investment as possible, mainly to meet performance targets and boost local tax revenues.\\nThis latter approach risked keeping inefficient firms afloat and worsening overcapacity, he added.\\n“If [Beijing] leans heavily into the supply-centric policy mix, it’s going to make the current deflation problem more persistent,” Xing warned, adding that “deflation is partially contributed [to] by the prevailing supply-demand imbalance.”\\n“That’s why we are excited to see in the five-year plan statement that they are making some gradual pivot, trying to rebalance towards consumption.”\\nChina’s prior focus on bolstering industrial and innovation capacity through supply-side measures is now evolving into a more integrated strategy that connects supply- and demand-side policies to sustain innovation-driven growth, Xing said.\\n“If you have too little demand, firms will be racing to the bottom – that’s not ideal for innovation and R&amp;D.”\\nDespite being one of the world’s largest markets, China continues to grapple with weak consumer confidence and subdued household spending. Initiatives such as the trade-in programme – which encourages the purchase of home appliances, vehicles and digital goods – have not fully revived sentiment.\\nIn its new proposals, Beijing acknowledged that economic development remains “unbalanced and inadequate”, with domestic demand still insufficient.\\nConsumption as a percentage of gross domestic product is only 40 per cent, partly because people save too much\\nRobin Xing, Morgan Stanley\\nTo create a “virtuous cycle” between consumption, investment and production, policymakers pledged to increase investment in livelihood-related sectors, using “new demand to drive new supply, and new supply to create new demand”.\\nXing said the proposals showed that China would “definitely focus more” on boosting consumption. This could include strengthening social welfare to reduce household concerns and encourage spending.\\n“Consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product is only 40 per cent, partly because people save too much”, he said, citing concerns about unemployment, education, healthcare and retirement.\\nHe also suggested reforms that would make local governments more reliant on direct taxes – such as those on consumption, corporate income and personal income – incentivising them to promote household spending rather than just factory output.\\n“China has focused on investment in infrastructure and manufacturing in the last 20 years, but now they are shifting away from investing in physical infrastructure to investing in human capital,” Xing said. “That’s a good pivot.”\\n",

            "title": "How are leading Western think tanks unboxing the Xi-Trump summit breakthroughs?",
            "description": "US President Donald Trump hailed his high-stakes meeting on Thursday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a “great success”, marked by progress on thorny trade issues.\\nTrump agreed to reduce America’s fentanyl-related tariffs on China by 10 percentage points and cut the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports from 57 per cent to 47 per cent. It was agreed Beijing would resume buying US farm products including soybeans and delay by one year the implementation of its most sweeping export controls on rare earths.\\nTrump said he and Xi also spoke at length about possible pathways to peace in the Ukraine war. Some perennially contentious issues, such as Taiwan, went unmentioned.\\nWhat does their meeting mean for trade and other issues between them? The Post looks at insights shared by major think tanks in America and Europe.\\n\\n\\nThe Centre for Strategic and International Studies\\nPhilip Luck and Hugh Grant-Chapman of CSIS said China’s soybean purchases would remain modest even if a deal between Xi and Trump was signed, highlighting the American market’s vulnerability.\\nThey noted Washington said Beijing agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of US soybeans in the remainder of 2025, though China had not confirmed the deal.\\n“Unless the US soybean industry diversifies into other markets, it will remain exposed to coercive Chinese economic statecraft in the future,” they added.\\nThe Council on Foreign Relations\\nDavid Sacks of CFR described the outcome of the two leaders’ meeting as a “temporary truce” without resolving any fundamental issues.\\n“Trump did, however, signal his desire for a more far-reaching accord, mentioning potential Chinese investment in the United States and noting that he anticipates reaching a trade deal with China ‘pretty soon’.\\n“One thing is clear: China has emerged from this latest iteration of the trade war in a stronger position than it entered,” Sacks added.\\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\\nJames Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told Reuters on Friday that if the goal of the meeting was to “generate leverage to force China to negotiate”, then “that’s unlikely to work”.\\n\\nThe Brookings Institution\\nMichael O’Hanlon of Brookings told CNBC on Friday that the meeting could be regarded as “a small win” for bilateral relations but nothing more than that.\\n“Compared to where this could go at a time when many people think that the United States and China may be headed for war, I’ll take a small win [for the meeting],” said O’Hanlon. “I think that’s all it was.”\\nThe Asia Society Policy Institute\\nWendy Cutler of ASPI saw the Trump-Xi meeting as vital for de-escalation.\\nBut Cutler, a former deputy US trade representative, believed Washington appeared not to address “structural issues” such as Beijing’s excess capacity and trade practices.\\n“As such, this truce may be short-lived,” she said.\\nRorry Daniels, also of ASPI, said Taiwan may have been relieved that it was not raised in Busan.\\n“But discomfort may set in over time about why it didn’t come up and what its absence” from Beijing’s agenda means for mainland China’s Taiwan policy in the long term, Daniels added.\\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics\\nMarcus Noland of PIIE welcomed Trump’s decision to cut US tariffs targeting China in response to Beijing’s commitment to tackling fentanyl.\\n“The fentanyl-related measure should make modest contributions to both the US economy and public health,” said Noland.\\n\\nChatham House\\nAccording to Laurel Rapp and Max Yoeli of the London-based think tank Chatham House, the summit reiterated the need for America’s partners to “pursue independent strategies to manage long-term turbulence”.\\nRapp and Yoeli said countries needed to move past ‘de-risking’ rhetoric to implement concrete plans for resilience against China’s assertiveness and America’s unpredictability in its policies.\\nRhodium Group\\nNoah Barkin of Rhodium Group said the primary risk for Europe post-summit was the countries striking bilateral deals on issues such as rare earths.\\nThis could sideline Europe and undermine transatlantic or Group of Seven partnerships on economic security cooperation, Barkin said, according to Italy-based news website Decode39.\\nHe believed Europe’s urgent priority in the next five to 10 years would be to move from de-risking rhetoric to concrete action in securing supply chains beyond China, especially on rare earths, eyeing a mitigation of the continent’s “glaring vulnerabilities”.\\nMartens Centre\\nZsuzsa Anna Ferenczy of the Brussels-based Martens Centre said the Sino-US truce was a case of the two sides buying time to manage their long-term competition, according to Radio Free Europe.\\nFerenczy believed neither country appeared interested in introducing complicating factors, such as the Ukraine war, that could distract from their focus on trade.\\nShe said China may have “overplayed its hand on rare earths”, adding that Europe, already fearful of Beijing’s near-monopoly of the highly sought metallic elements, would have an appetite for “collective action” to counter Beijing’s “weaponisation” of the commodities.\\n",

            "title": "Why India maintains a balancing act between US and Russia in defence",
            "description": "India and the United States have renewed a 10-year defence framework, reaffirming their strategic partnership despite simmering tensions over trade and Delhi’s deepening defence ties with Russia.\\nThe timing of the signing has put a spotlight on the balancing act required to maintain India–US defence ties, in which Delhi’s pursuit of American weapon systems is complicated by its deepening military dependence on Moscow, according to analysts.\\nThe agreement was signed on Friday in Kuala Lumpur by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who hailed it as a milestone for bilateral military cooperation. They were holding talks on the sidelines of the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in the Malaysian capital.\\n“This advances our defence partnership, a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence. We’re enhancing our coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation. Our defence ties have never been stronger,” Hegseth posted on social media.\\nRelations between New Delhi and Washington have deteriorated over the past few months, after the US imposed a 50 per cent import tariff on Indian exports, partly as penalties for India’s purchases of Russian oil.\\nDespite the tensions, the two sides have maintained their defence ties and continued to hold joint military exercises. They have also been trying to finalise a trade agreement.\\n\\nWhile the defence framework was extended for the third time on Friday, the timing of its signing was significant, said Vivek Mishra, deputy director of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation.\\n“At the political level, it is a strong signal that engagement from both sides continues as normal,” he said, adding that it augured well for bilateral ties at a broad level amid their trade discussions.\\nIndia has been looking to Russia for its supply of weapons even as it seeks to ease trade tensions with the US.\\nDelhi is reportedly planning to buy more units of Russia’s S-400 Triumf missile system to boost its air defence capabilities, according to local media reports. Following a contract signed in 2018, India has acquired five units of the S-400 system, with the option of buying five more at the same price.\\nThe Russian system played a significant role during a brief clash between India and its arch-rival Pakistan in May.\\nWhatever weapons India plans to buy from the US would depend on its assessment of the different platforms that best suit its defence needs, according to Mishra.\\nThe Indian military has leaned towards US systems for surveillance and reconnaissance, but is less keen on American air defence systems, he added.\\n\\nIndia has also not indicated whether it would like to buy American-made F-35 stealth fighter planes despite US President Donald Trump having offered the aircraft for sale to Delhi.\\nThere have been reports that India may look to buy Russian-made Su-57 aircraft even as it is looking to build its own advanced medium combat aircraft.\\nRussia’s willingness to transfer its latest military technology to India would be viewed favourably by Delhi because it wants to be more self-reliant in weapons development by buying less from its external suppliers and building its defence sector, according to analysts.\\nIn contrast, the US had not been willing to share its technology with India, Mishra noted. Nonetheless, he suggested more joint ventures between the two countries under the renewed defence framework to solidify their ties. Satellite-based communications and infantry combat vehicles are among the areas that both sides can collaborate on, according to Mishra.\\nIndian conglomerates like the Tata Group and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra are currently partnering with their American counterparts to manufacture parts of the C-130 J Super Hercules transport aircraft, the fuselage of Apache helicopters and underwater vehicles.\\nIf Washington were to treat India as a strategic partner by sharing more technology, it could help reduce the trust deficit between the two countries, Mishra said.\\n\\n\\nAnalysts have noted that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped the recently concluded Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur as he reportedly wanted to avoid a meeting with Trump. India has insisted that the ceasefire reached with Pakistan in May was primarily due to the efforts of the two sides, contrary to Trump’s claims that he played a leading role in ending the conflict.\\nWashington has long positioned India as a geopolitical counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. Earlier on Friday, Hegseth voiced concerns in talks with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun about Beijing’s naval activity around the South China Sea.\\nTies between India and the US have also been strained by the perceived aim of Washington to draw itself closer to Islamabad, including securing Pakistan’s critical mineral resources and access to its ports, according to analysts.\\nPriyajit Debsarkar, a London-based political and security analyst on South Asia, said: “These things have to be taken into consideration. If the US thinks that it can sail on two boats, then it probably won’t work.”\\n",
